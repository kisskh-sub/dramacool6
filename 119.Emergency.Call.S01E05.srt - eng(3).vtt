I'm terribly sorry for the trouble we caused you yesterday.

But may I ask how a dispatcher found me here?
[Kasuhara Yuki, Dispatcher]

I visited the payphone from where we received the call.

I believe the caller made the report to harass you.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.400
Perhaps this was the work of that man.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:55.870
A certain regular of ours asked for my phone number the other day,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.200
and I turned him down.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.500
I didn't even know who he was.

Did you tell him your name?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.240
I didn't mean to tell him, but I had my name tag on.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.250
That's why he knew how to write her name.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.500

I believe he made the mistake, because he wrote it down as is.
[207]

Okay. I'll report your findings to the higher-ups.

What?

Back then, we were all affected by the disaster,

Improvements in tech and general systematics

- Yes.

As a result, our staff prioritized this prank call,

The fact of the matter is, the dispatcher was tricked by this call.

help is dispatched if there's any chance a life is at risk.

Do you know the scariest part of this job?

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.500
It hurts. Wh-What do I do?
[People's hearts]

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.600
I wanted to tell Onee-chan that I am doing well...

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.620
We'll deliver the baby in the vehicle.
[The voice of life]

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.490
Sympathizing with our callers is essential in this line of work.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.800
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.090
I will be hanging up if there is no emergency.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.100
[End Call]

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.450
Oh, Misotatsu-san again?

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.840
Those on the frontlines aren’t the only stars of the show.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.140
I was hit by a man.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.200
And I'm bleeding. I can hear it!

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.810
It's close!
