Yokohama Fire Department! Anyone inside?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.770
- Hello? Anyone?
- Yokohama Fire Department!

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.740
Ma'am, are you all right?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.690
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.000
- Can you stand?
- We've found an individual in need of rescue!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.250
- We'll retreat from here!
- Let's stand up slowly, Ma'am.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.890
Grab on to my shoulder.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740
Careful now.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.810
My husband...

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.370
- We're heading out!
- Yes, Sir!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.280
- Careful.
- Are you all right?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.750
- You're almost there, Ma'am.
- Please take care of her.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.450
Everything will burn...

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.430
- Hey, Kaneshita!
- Kaneshita-san!

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.110
Are you okay, Kaneshita-san?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.060
Stay back!

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.440
Go! Hurry!

[402 - Kaneshita]

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.540
Is it so bad to visit the site of an emergency?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.000
You think it'd help if we trampled in as stand-ins and "imagined" the scenario?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.210
Well, it won't help a single soul!

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.460
In any case, we may be stand-ins.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.380
But I think we're stand-ins who tether lives together.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.140
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.150
Oh, right!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.390
- Hey, is this...
- Yes.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.900

[Research "the jobs" of people close to you.]

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.510
Hikari's absolutely set on presenting about your job.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.460
You should tell him sooner rather than later.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.630
There are currently 3,771,000 people living in this city of Yokohama.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.890
We take every 119 call in this city, one of the largest cities in Japan,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.420
at the Yokohama Fire Bureau's Command Center here.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.270
Last year, we received a total of 373,121 inquiries.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.660
That means 1,022 calls per day, on average.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.020
That's a call every 1 minute and 25 seconds,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.260
with an ambulance sent out every 2 minutes and 4 seconds.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.060
I know, that's a lot.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.570
Now let's head upstairs and see these experts at work.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.260
- Come on, everyone.
- Okay!

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.980
- Watch your step.
- Sure.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.470
See? There they are.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.750
And don't trip.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.990
- Woah.
- Wow! That's awesome!

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.880
These individuals who answer tense calls daily

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.260
are called dispatchers or dispatch controllers.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.020
- "Dispatchers"? I see.
- Great!

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.980
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.210
M-My son! H-He's only one.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.190
A-And I think he swallowed one of those button batteries!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.280
Understood. Please tell us where to send an ambulance.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.870
B-But I didn't actually see him swallow it.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.500
I just don't see the battery anywhere, and I think, maybe, he...

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.830
Anyway, we will send an ambulance. But I will need your address.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.100
The ones working up front are known as "call takers."

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.190
Though they normally handle audio calls over the phone,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.380
nowadays, we have a system, "Video 119,"

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.160
- where we can speak via an individual's phone camera as well.
- I see.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.960
See, there's a good example.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.280
Please help me!

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.420
I've been stuck here for an hour! It's so painful!

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.760
Please hurry!

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.380
You're fine now, so calm down, Sir.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.860
What is the present situation, Sir?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.760
Could the person holding the camera step back a bit?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.410
- Okay.
- Using our "Video 119" service,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.760
we can give instructions that may be hard to convey by phone,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.660
or we can get a better grasp on situations.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.870
So he's quite literally stuck in an octopus.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.390
2-41-3 East Sakurazaka, Asahi Ward.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.010
- Nagaoka-san's residence, right?
- Yes.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.880
Those working behind the call takers are in assistant command.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.780
- Should I hit his back, or...
- No, you don't have to do anything.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.880
- Tell her no water either.
- Right.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.620
Then who's the person at the very back?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.240
What's going on with 3 and 2?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.790
- I'll have 3 take point. End your call, 2.
- Yes, Sir.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.540
That is the primary commander's seat.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.870
The commander organizes all reports that the Command Center receives.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.640
Indeed, that old guy does look quite important.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.930
- Incorrect! Too bad.
- What?

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.900
Although that "old man" is a super veteran, he's actually my subordinate.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.100
The Command Center cycles our work between three squads.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.350
And I am the one in charge of Squad 3 here.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.820
Right, Tanaka-kun?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.320
Right indeed.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.590
Excuse me, I want to see the firefighters in action.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.000
Me, too. I want to see them ride fire trucks!

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.950
Boys! I'm so sorry...

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.110
No, I understand how you feel.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.840
But here's the thing. Not all firefighters ride fire trucks.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.610
- What?
- Really?

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.910
"Firefighters" are just one category of individuals working in a fire department.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.330
Everyone here starts as a firefighter, whether they work in the fire brigade,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.590
ambulance team, or general affairs.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.130
That's right.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.070
Every dispatcher here has gained some sort of experience

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.600
on the fire brigade or rescue squad before coming to Command.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.510
I explained lots of things.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.700
But remember, everyone, to call 119 in case of fire, illness, or need for help.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.400
- Okay.
- But absolutely no prank calls. Got that?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.260
Yes, Ma'am.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.030
What should we do when we see Capytaro, then?

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.080
"Capytaro"?

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.300
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.370
W-Well...Ambulance.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.490
My coworker cut their finger on a factory machine.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.910
There's a lot of blood everywhere!

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.170
Is your coworker male or female?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.020
- Male!
- How old is he?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.910
I think he's in his twenties.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.120
- The one in Tsurumi Ward.
- Sakuyama Industry, Tsurumi Ward, right?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.900
- Yes.
- Do you have an exact address?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.610
An address...

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.880
What? Someone called an ambulance? Who on earth?

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.530
Hello? Is everything all right?

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.090
An address, was it? One moment...

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.030
I'm terribly sorry. I'm a temporary employee who joined recently.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.250
Have her hand the phone to another employee if possible.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.970
Easy, Ma'am. Everything will be okay.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.900
I've found the address.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.790
We're located at 3-7-13 Hamaecho, Tsurumi Ward.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.710
I've located the factory.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.830
[Dispatch]

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.910
Rest assured. An ambulance is headed your way.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.820
It seems the factory has many buildings.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.120
Do you know which building you are currently in?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.120
How do I describe this? I can say only that it's a workshop of sorts...

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.200
"A workshop."

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.920
Is there anything striking about the building?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.750
- "Striking"?
- Kasuhara, that's enough. Instruct her on first aid.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.080
Ma'am, I'd like you to provide first aid until the ambulance arrives.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.410
Can you do that for me?

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.850
Y-Yes.

[Injury with uncontrollable bleeding]

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.980
Being observed by the kids made us unexpectedly nervous, right?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.380
Agreed.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.050
You should've instructed that caller earlier to give the phone to another worker.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.630
She was the one who called.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.120
She was most likely responsible for handling the situation at that time.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.330
"Most likely"? We couldn't pinpoint the location because of your assumption.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:58.420
That's why I was trying to get the information from her, but you stopped me.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.160
I stopped you because the wounded man needed prompt first aid.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.150
Besides, you could've gotten the ambulance team

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.430
to their location without interrogating the caller.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.630
- How so?
- Think for yourself.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.490
I'm not your mentor anymore.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.080
I feel they argue more now that they're not mentor-mentee.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.200
Agreed.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.350
The ambulance team sent us their report.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.080
Really? Thank you.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.810
Here is the spring training regimen for our new trainees.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.930
Could you look it over?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.530
- What a pain. No way!
- Sir, please.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.240
I need you to train our next generation of legends

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.020
while you're still around, Dojima-san.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.370
Oh, you incurred the "legend fine." You owe me ¥100.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.180
What are you even saving up for?

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.810
I haven't saved that much yet.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.380
- Team Leader.
- Yes?

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.220
How long have you and Dojima-san known each other?

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.660
I wonder when...

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.410
I think it's been about 15 or 16 years now.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:31.480
He was my mentor when I first started working here.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.190
I guess I'll need at least a decade as well...

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.220
Let me guess. You're worrying about Kaneshita?

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.880
Yes. I wonder if he hates me.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.410
You both value different things as dispatchers, that's all.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.100
Besides, the fact that you can talk back to him is plenty.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.810
Stubborn guys like him

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.250
crack under subordinates who act clueless.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.940
That's partially why I assigned him to be your mentor.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.480
- Really?
- Yes.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.090
So I'm hoping you do well with him.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.030
I will do my best.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.970

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.030
Is there anything troubling you at the moment?

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.920
Most cases of aphonia are caused by stress.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.090
Please be sure not to emotionally corner yourself.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.410
Kaneshita-san! Good morning.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.070
Morning.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.780
Did everything turn out all right?

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.900
With your son and all...

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.580
Oh, right.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.640
It's none of your business, Kasuhara.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.050
Keep at it!

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.690
Is the pain only in your hip?
[Hip pain]

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.230
- Do you feel pain anywhere else?
- Just hurry up!

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.280
Sir, the ambulance is already on its way.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.780
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.820
Actually, there's this capybara...

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.940
- A capybara?
- Yes. It's by the river.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.000
Could you possibly capture it?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.210
- Has someone been hurt by the animal?
- No.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.260
I see. I'm terribly sorry,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.880
but we can't send an ambulance or fire truck to capture animals.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.570
What? Then what should I do about it?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.030
I believe you should first contact the city hall.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.240
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.750
I will be ending the call, then.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.330
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.580
Pardon? A capybara?

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.220
I see.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.810
What to do...

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.000
- I'm giving it a pull. Ready?
- Yes.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.300
- You look antsy to pull yours, Tanaka.
- Yes.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.260
- I am!
- You are? Then let's do this.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.510
Ready and... pull!

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.830
- Wow!
- That's steaming...

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.780
- What is that?
- This?

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.190
It's a self-heating lunch box. I asked Tanaka-kun to get us some.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.680
Sure.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.210
When you pull this string, water mixes with quicklime...

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.280
creating heat.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.590
Water creates heat? Fascinating, isn't it?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.090
That can happen when putting out a fire too, right?

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.700
Powdered aluminum and magnesium are prime examples.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.320
Pour water on those when there's a fire, and you could even cause an explosion.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.600
You're right.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.560
I assumed water resolved any fire until I worked here.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.680
Was my response so wrong?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.790
Capturing a capybara isn't our job.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.370
There was no point in giving them hope when I already turned them down.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.570
- A capybara?
- This was a request from a civilian.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.630
I can't turn them down if they beg!

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.390
- What's this about a capybara?
- Taking on those requests

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:50.050
is exactly why people now associate 119 with animal control.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.610
- And who does that tire out?
- Certainly not the capybara.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.640
The fire department and ambulance squad exist to save people's lives.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.290
Don't have them waste their time on anything else.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.040
So, before the capybara, were we talking...

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.500
Why is Kaneshita-san obsessed with rescue squads?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.510
If he loves them so much, why not go back to them?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:15.040
I'm sure he would if he could.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.110
- Bon appétit.
- Hold it, Tanaka-kun.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.830
- Do you know something?
- What?

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.000
Well, I can't tell you anything, you know?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.220
And I don't appreciate being led on,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.420
only to be left hanging.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.980
Oh, well. This is for clicking his tongue at me.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:47.220
When Kaneshita-san was a firefighter, he was involved in an accident.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.920
- Are you okay, Kaneshita-san?
- Stay back!

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.730
Shiomi.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.600
Shiomi! Shiomi!

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.480
His junior who went to help him sustained the bigger injury.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.670
Kaneshita-san resigned because there was no point in staying

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.730
when his junior had to quit.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.750
I'm sure Kaneshita-san felt responsible for his junior's fate.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.840
Why did you run back in for the photograph?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.660
I'm sorry.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.670
I heard the story from Tanaka-kun.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.830
Damn you, Tanaka.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.910
So, why?

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:20.470
When I was in college, I saw the devastation in Tohoku.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.590
[March, 2011]

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:02.440
I realized how painful it is to lose physical evidence of your family.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.900
Even so,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.210
the actions I took back then were not befitting of a firefighter.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.490
Ultimately, I only caused confusion.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:24.590
I even wrecked someone else's life.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.260
Each unit should function within their respective domains.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.020
We shouldn't overstep our given responsibilities.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.610
So that's why you stop me.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.380
Ideals, justice, even your "imagination"...

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.320
If we're blinded by such things,

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.240
we'll only exhaust ourselves and those around us.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.790
But, Sir...

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:01.760
Is there anyone working this job who doesn't have a sense of justice?

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.500
We want to save people's lives.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.000
This thought drives us all to action, does it not?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.360
It doesn't matter which department you're in.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.750
Sorry, Sir. I've acted like a know-it-all.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.730
I'll see you again for our afternoon shift.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.560
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.310
Both.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.800

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.320

You've been working here so long that they call you a legend.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.600
There must be a reason for that.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:10.690
I originally joined this crew because I wanted to be a firefighter.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.940
It's partially because my dad was a firefighter.
