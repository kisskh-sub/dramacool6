Why did you do that?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.060

she practically played our matchmaker.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.080
She can stay here as our honored guest.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.199
(How could it be?)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.560

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000

(Ye Chenyuan isn't the Night Deity?)

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.819
(Was he helping me
obtain the Divine Sword?)

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:38.100
Bai Xiaoying, you're not oblivious
to my intentions.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.740
You're simply trampling on my feelings.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.300
(Does he like me?)

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.072
You asked me to marry Hua Yuying.

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.819
It broke my heart.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.060
(But now he's truly going to
marry Hua Yuying.)

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.459
(The time we spent together)

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.180
(should have proper closure.)

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.139
That's Xiaoying's aura.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.220
Ye Chenyuan,

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.339
there's something I need to tell you.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.480
I initially thought you were my enemy,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.259
but

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:38.540
I've realized things
aren't as I assumed.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.100
Yet the misunderstanding
between us remains.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.019
I pushed you toward Hua Yuying
with my own hands.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:51.420
I'm saying this

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:52.980
not to change anything.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.620
You're about to marry after all,

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.139
and you're opposing the immortal sect.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.959
Though I'm no longer
an immortal sect disciple,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.759
I can't ally myself with the Night Clan.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.079
It's just

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.740
that all this time we've spent entangled

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.300
should have proper closure.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.339
Closure?

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.860
Very well.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.040
I've said my piece.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:27.560
From now on,

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.600
we can both move on.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.860
I detest sneaky hussies
who scheme behind people's backs.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.240
I never imagined

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.399
you'd dare seduce our master.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.779
Is this coy act of feigned resistance

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:48.699
typical of you immortal sect people?

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.100
Disgusting. Shameless!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.399
Miss Bai,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.560
we Night Clan members

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.160
love and hate boldly.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.480
When we desire someone,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.959
be they betrothed or already married,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.839
we'll fight for them.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.680
But we despise those
who scheme in shadows.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.060
Ye Chenyuan,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.180
Miss Bai has laid bare her feelings.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.779
Shouldn't you make your stance clear?

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.519
She's the one
clinging to me unilaterally.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.079
None of my business.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:41.860
How could someone from Nine Heavens
be so shamelessly persistent?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.560
Exactly. How could our master
fancy such a lowly wretch?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.040
Xiaoying!

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.279
I came late.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.480
Master.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.319
Are you hurt?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.519
I'm fine.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:58.800
Let's leave here.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.399
Wait.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.240
Ye Chenyuan,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.079
what else do you want?

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.360
Take your thing

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.439
away.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:53.639
Xiaoying,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:55.519
let's go.

00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:28.429
(Steamed Buns)

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.700
Thank you, Master.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.519
Though I don't understand

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.240
what truly happened
between you and Ye Chenyuan,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.320
Nine Heavens remains your home.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.639
Return with me.

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.120
Master,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.559
I know you care for me.

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:00.840
But the immortal sect

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600
abandoned all trust in me.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:05.299
If I return now,

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:07.779
they won't let me go unpunished.

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:09.379
Don't worry.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.299
Sacrificing you

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.299
was the elders' unauthorized decision.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:15.139
Their use of the forbidden technique

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:16.779
has violated celestial laws.

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.179
I've obtained evidence

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.620
and will clear your name
before the Immortal Lord.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:24.899
But...

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:25.340
Xiaoying,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.820
I trust you.

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:32.700
But the immortal sect

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:34.100
owns the Divine Sword.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:36.899
How can you seek vengeance

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:38.059
if hunted by Nine Heavens?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.299
Return to borrow
the immortal sect's power

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:41.940
to slay the Night Deity.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.980
Trust me.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.139
I'll secure your standing

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:53.539
within the Nine Heavens.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.860
Bai Xiaoying, you traitor!

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.139
Kneel now!

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:32.980
Yunya,

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:35.019
will you betray the Nine Heavens too?

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.019
The final battle remains

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:39.259
shrouded in doubt.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.539
Until truth emerges,

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.860
none shall harm her.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:46.980
Yunya,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.820
I've never seen you
lose your composure like this.

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:53.059
Now that you've
brought Bai Xiaoying back,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.539
why are you covering for her?

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.419
My lord,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.679
the incident began when Bai Xiaoying
was trapped by a formation.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.379
It used a forbidden technique

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.860
that could induce demonic possession.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:07.980
Do you have proof
of the forbidden technique?

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.539
Ancient archives document

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.980
this forbidden technique.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:19.480
So Xiaoying fell victim
to a forbidden technique that day.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.440
Is she a traitor or not?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.799
She isn't. I vouch for her.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.480
Master,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.840
have you considered

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.840
how a mediocre disciple
like Bai Xiaoying

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.039
gained such power
after the Trial Assembly?

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:37.519
She must be a demon.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.519
Using an evil being as a sacrifice

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.320
is justified.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.440
Besides,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.639
she poisoned you that day.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.039
It's proof of her treachery.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.440
How can you defend

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.919
such a vile creature?

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.360
Calling her a demon?

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.639
Where's the proof?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.879
As for me,

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:55.200
I consumed something unfit that day.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:56.559
Xiaoying is blameless.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.600
Master,

00:12:57.879 --> 00:12:59.000
you defend her so blindly.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.360
Have you

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:02.120
developed romantic affection?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.559
Though a lowly servant,

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:06.600
she's a disciple from Yunxiu Pavilion.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.639
This bond

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.120
defies all propriety.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:10.879
How could it be?

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:11.879
It can't be.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.720
Worry not.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.080
Leave it to me.

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.320
I do have biases.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.879
For every disciple under me,

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.559
I give equal care.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.360
Now my disciple is wrongfully accused.

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.480
I must fight for justice.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.320
Otherwise,

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:32.200
I'd be unworthy as her master.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.759
The forbidden technique

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.120
is authorized by me.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.200
Her inner energy is sinister.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.639
How could I entrust our Divine Sword

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.000
to someone like her?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.639
I swear upon my life

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.279
Xiaoying isn't of the Night Clan.

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:55.320
Yunya,

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:58.759
I've never seen you act
so aggressively before.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.240
Clearly, her influence over you
cannot be underestimated.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.360
How can I trust

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:06.919
that you're not bewitched by her?

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.799
I mean no disrespect to you.

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:11.320
But there's no proof
proving her demonic nature.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.240
Do you have proof to prove she isn't?

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:19.519
My lord.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
If I recall correctly,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.799
immortals have a Soul-Crushing Array.

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:29.840
It refines both body and soul
of Night Clan captives,

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:32.440
denying them reincarnation.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.720
If ordinary people enter,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.360
they endure profound agony.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.320
But Night Clan members

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.159
will be utterly annihilated.

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.000
If you doubt me,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.759
I can enter this array to prove

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.799
my innocence.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.559
It's too cruel.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:47.679
Xiaoying,

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:48.639
no need for this.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:50.360
Don't worry, Master.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:52.200
I'm absolutely certain now

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.120
no Night Deity's power is within me.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.519
(Because Ye Chenyuan)

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.799
(isn't the Night Deity at all.)

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.759
All immortals!

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.759
Activate the Soul-Crushing Array.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.559
Wait!

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.720
If Xiaoying survives

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.480
and proves her innocence,

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:24.600
what then?

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.159
What would you demand?

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:28.399
If her innocence is proven,

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.759
she rightfully earned the Divine Sword

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.720
and deserves recognition
as Sword Master.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.519
I consent.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.960
If she emerges alive,

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.759
she'll be Nine Heavens'
official Sword Master.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.080
(Impossible.)

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.519
(Could it be...)

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.960
- Xiaoying, what's wrong?
- Don't go.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.820
(I think I'm truly at my limit.)

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.740
(How did this happen?)

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:39.620
Xiaoying!

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.299
(Forgive me,)

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:45.259
(Master.)

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.819
Are you alright?

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.539
Impossible!

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.180
She survived?

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.180
The array

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.140
has rendered its verdict.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.460
I'm no Night Clan member,

00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:55.700
nor do I possess
the Night Deity's power.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.099
Well?

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.380
It appears I was mistaken.

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:13.220
Since we wronged Bai Xiaoying,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.460
she shall reclaim her position
as Sword Master.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:20.980
Bai Xiaoying,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.940
from this day forth,

00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:26.259
the duty to eradicate the Night Deity
and save the Three Realms

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.779
rests upon your shoulders.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.740
Thank you.

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:21.720
Xiaoying,

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:24.319
what's on your mind?

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.400
Master.

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:33.640
Thank you for your unwavering support

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:35.279
in clearing my name.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.720
Now I can walk freely

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.440
through the Three Realms.

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:41.400
You're my...

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:45.960
disciple.

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:48.599
Clearing your name

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:49.680
was my obligation.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.039
But entering the Soul-Crushing Array

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.920
was reckless.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.160
Don't act so impulsively again.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.920
I just wanted

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.400
to spare you the dilemma back then.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.039
One more thing

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.759
I must remind you.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.680
No matter your history with Ye Chenyuan,

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.839
the War God's duty
is to slay the Night Deity

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.200
and fight the Night Clan.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.900
Do you understand?

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:25.359
I understand, Master.

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:28.160
I know my duty.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.599
What are you doing?

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:58.759
Must you be so oblivious?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.880
Fine.

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:02.559
I'm feeling generous today,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.680
so I'll teach you.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.880
Have you forgotten

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.119
our marriage is merely transactional?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.119
Gaining the sword crystal,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.359
I'll marry you
to jointly rule the Night Clan.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:21.200
Don't delude yourself
into thinking you're my real wife.

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:22.880
You can't be serious.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.279
You'd make me a widow in life?

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.200
You're the one
who demanded marriage as a condition.

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:30.240
If you don't want to,

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.200
we can discuss other terms.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.880
Ye Chenyuan,

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.839
Bai Xiaoying has returned
to the Nine Heavens

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.640
and is the Sword Master
destined to kill you.

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:43.680
You choose now to play tricks with me?

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.000
Isn't it a bit too late?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.400
Give it up.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.880
She's now our enemy.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.599
There's no future between you two.

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:53.240
Shut up!

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.480
This version of you,

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.400
I find it more appealing.

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:15.960
Is that you?

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.240
Ye Chenyuan,

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:33.480
what do you want?

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:36.339
So you did become the Sword Master.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.359
After how Nine Heavens treated you,

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.160
you'd still return to protect them?

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.920
Should I praise your magnanimity

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.000
or condemn your ambition?

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.720
Or perhaps

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.160
you're motivated by affection?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.640
Ye Chenyuan,

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.559
did you come here just to say this?

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.039
Seems I guessed right.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.000
You've barely left the Night Clan,

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:01.759
yet you're already entangled
with your master.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.039
It violates natural order.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.440
The Nine Heavens permits such audacity?

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.440
What a cosmic joke!

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:12.400
Exactly.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.880
My master protects and respects me.

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:16.559
He cleared my name

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.039
and made me the Sword Master.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.599
He's the finest man in all realms.

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:21.960
What's that to you?

00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:26.400
Let's go.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:31.559
You won't take Xiaoying.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.440
You dare stop me?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.559
Master!

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.359
Come with me.

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:06.880
Xiaoying!

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:11.200
Let go of me!

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:12.519
Let go!

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.480
So, you gave up the sword crystal

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.599
and insisted on leaving for him?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.599
Ye Chenyuan, have you forgotten

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:24.519
how I begged you so pathetically

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.599
not to marry Hua Yuying?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.019
What was your answer?

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:30.619
Now you change your mind?

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:31.940
What's that to me?

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.339
You don't want the sword crystal?

00:24:35.859 --> 00:24:36.700
Of course I do.

00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:40.700
Xiaoying!

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.059
Master, you...

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.619
No!

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.220
Stop!

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:50.099
Xiaoying,

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:52.099
why defend a Night Clan member?

00:24:55.059 --> 00:24:56.180
Master, you misunderstood.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.779
He's not here for war.

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:00.579
He's helping us get the sword crystal.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.099
The sword crystal
awakens the Divine Sword

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:04.080
to slay the Night Deity.

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:05.940
Why would he help you get it?

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.660
Master,

00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:13.700
I'll explain everything later.

00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:15.420
But please trust me.

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:18.099
He means no harm this time.

00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:27.539
Our personal scores

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.819
will be settled another time.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.539
Today's negotiation

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:50.339
shouldn't occur in Nine Heavens.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.059
As a mortal representative,

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:55.140
I choose the Mortal Realm as the venue.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.099
Ye Chenyuan represents his clan.

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:00.460
Master represents the Nine Heavens.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.500
Where's the sword crystal?

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.259
It's still with Hua Yuying
of the Night Clan.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.779
Xiaoying says
you're not the Night Deity.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.180
So that's true.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.380
The true one wouldn't lose
to his underlings.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.259
Didn't you lose to your own disciple?

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.119
You even tried to kill her.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:21.640
If not for you,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.400
would she have turned traitor?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.759
If not for me,

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:28.240
would she be sitting here alive today?

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:35.559
Master,

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:37.440
let's not dwell on the past.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.460
The optimal solution now

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.180
is to utilize my master's power.

00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:56.019
This way,

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.380
Hua Yuying can no longer rival us.

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:00.339
Ye Chenyuan can reclaim the Night Clan.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.500
We'll get the sword crystal.

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.000
Xiaoying,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.740
I trust you.

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.099
But I don't trust him.

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:14.110
I should lead the Nine Heavens forces

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:16.000
to storm the Night Clan
and seize the crystal.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.980
You?

00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:20.019
You'd lose your head

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.259
before reaching the Night Clan.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.220
What do you mean?

00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:34.140
Master,

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:35.539
if you doubt him,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.299
test him with Truthwater.

00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:56.700
Ye Chenyuan,

00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:59.099
if we help you overthrow Hua Yuying,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.019
will you give us the sword crystal?

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.579
Yes.

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:06.740
Master,

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:07.779
your turn.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.259
Are you taking

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.319
the sword crystal for Xiaoying?

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.339
Master,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.299
this kind of...

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.980
Yes.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.220
Do you have feelings for Xiaoying?
