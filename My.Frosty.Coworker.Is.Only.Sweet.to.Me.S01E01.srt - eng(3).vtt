00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.468
A social gathering?

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.533
I can't.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:11.028
Leave me out.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.933
I'll go, see you.

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.094
- Bye!
- What the heck?

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.533
We invited him, and that's all we get?

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.866
Relax. You know Soma-kun's just like that.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.800
Oh, Soma-kun... not again.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.666
Cold as ice, isn't he?

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.800
He's so annoying.

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:47.033
- Cold...
- Soma-kun, wait up!

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:53.600
The way you replied to them earlier wasn't good, you know.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.666
They invited you out for drinks so you can bond with everyone.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.460
And are you going, Ogata-san?

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:11.637
No, I... well...

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:26.779
I can't, because I need to go buy sweets that are available only today.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.333
So you're choosing sweets over mingling, too.

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:40.300
I wish you'd show that smile to others, too.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.200
When you smile, the others are happy.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.466
No, I can't do that.

00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:51.847
You are special, Ogata-san.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.400
Wh-Why'd you take my hand?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.020
My hands got suddenly cold. I wanted to borrow your heat.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:05.500
You're so warm.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.700
Borrow my heat? What on Earth?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.333
Oh, come on!

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.600
You're blushing.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.658
Stop it!

What? What was that all about?

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.566
Soma-kun has a low body temp and is frosty to all at work.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.166
But to me, his nosy co-worker with a rather high body temp...

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.733
he's super sweet for some reason.

I think it all began "that day."

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:09.400
I was on my way back from a business meeting,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.780
when it suddenly started raining.

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:17.833
Is that you, Soma-kun?

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.330
Hello...

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.860
What's wrong? You look pale.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.200
Just ignore me. I get cold easily.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.610
No, no...

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.600
It stopped?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.160
I can't ignore you!

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:37.066
What are you doing?

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:38.457
Bear with it.

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:43.266
I have a high body temp. It's better than doing nothing.

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.400
Your hand is ice cold!

It's fine.

00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:00.346
You don't have to do that.

Yes, I do! Ask for help when you're having a hard time.

You're so cold.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:27.366

Bye bye, Snack Time.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.348
Ogata, I swear you daily eat dorayaki (red bean paste pancakes).

00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:35.206
You'll turn into one soon!

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:39.070
Watch what you say, Chief.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.066
Did I say something wrong?

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:43.899
You said everything wrong!

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.166
And for your information, I have it only once a week!

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.199
Kotori, don't humor him.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.399
I'd eat ten daily if I could.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.566
T-Ten?

00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:58.199
That'll basically be your main meal.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.066
Yes, they're what keep me going.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:03.232
They are delicious though.

You look super happy.

- Nice.
- That hits the spot.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.299
But no way I could eat ten.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.032
Me, neither.

00:07:11.032 --> 00:07:12.632
Hey!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.799
Come on, meeting time.

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:16.899
Can I bring my dorayaki?

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.032
Hurry up!

00:07:18.032 --> 00:07:20.432
- Obviously, no.
- "No"?

00:07:20.432 --> 00:07:23.366
- Quickly now.
- I'll be back.

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.140
We're going.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.130
Okay.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:33.599

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.499
- Really?
- Yes.

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:36.699
Their fries are great too.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.066
Let's get this meeting started then.

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:41.099
Okay.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:45.232
First up, Florena's website revamp.

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.532
So they're a women's apparel company and...

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:51.466
Their clothing samples arrived.

00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:55.499
Let's draft the proposal and include those then?

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:57.450
I'd like to help,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.399
but I need to fix stuff for Tamago Company as soon as possible, sorry!

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.366
It due today.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.399
Oh, that's tough.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:09.199
But you prioritize that then. I'll handle this alone.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:13.366
I'll help out if I manage to finish early.

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:17.266
It's okay, good work takes time.

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:18.699
I'll be fine.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.866
Thank you.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.554
I'll help.

00:08:34.032 --> 00:08:36.732
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:41.732
Thanks.

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:47.165
- Done.
- Okay.

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:48.732
The white one next.

00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:50.232
Okay.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:56.598
A little bit higher.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:59.932
Done.

00:08:59.932 --> 00:09:04.498
I see. They use a lot of bright colors.

00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:10.165
This is size Large?

00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:16.998
It's way too small.

00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:21.098
Is something wrong?

00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:25.098
Oh no, nothing.

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:30.732
Seeing these really helps get ideas flowing.

00:09:30.732 --> 00:09:34.265
It might help to see the store layouts too.

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:39.032
All right, this light blue one next.

00:09:39.032 --> 00:09:42.065
Shall we go now then?

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:53.298
Let me get ready.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.665
That was useful because I could see the customer base.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:00.365
Thanks for setting up the appointment too.

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:01.765
No problem.

00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:07.532
Right, then... Let's call it a day and part ways here.

00:10:07.532 --> 00:10:10.298
I'm heading this way so see you tomorrow.

00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:12.332
Wait.

00:10:12.332 --> 00:10:15.360
- Since we're here, shall we go somewhere?
- What?

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:19.632
Or are you busy? Checking out sweets again?

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:22.065
I was just going home, but...

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:23.832
Let's go then.

00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:29.198
No, there's no deeper meaning in this.

00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:32.565
Soma-kun's hand is just cold, like always.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:38.965
Wait, hold on, his hand isn't cold at all.

00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:40.532
Soma-kun, you...

00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:42.265
Yes?

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.232
N-Nothing.

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:51.010
Why is he holding my hand when he's not even cold?

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.432
If I ask him that, he might let go.

00:10:55.432 --> 00:10:57.632
Oh, right, Ogata-san.

00:10:58.898 --> 00:11:01.265
Shall we go buy some sweets?

00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:02.898
What, really?

00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:06.098
Of course. Do you want to go anywhere?

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:10.898
Actually, there is one.

00:11:10.898 --> 00:11:13.065
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:15.398
What do they sell?

00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:19.398
You'll see when we get there.

00:11:19.398 --> 00:11:21.298
Which way?

00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.898
Let's see... Straight for now.

00:11:23.898 --> 00:11:25.898
- For now?
- Yes.

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:34.432
Here?

00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:38.332
Yes, same place I went to yesterday.

Pardon me.

00:12:10.732 --> 00:12:13.032
Oh no, pardon me.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:18.565
I was so focused on the dorayaki, I didn't pay attention.

Thank you for your patronage.

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:25.532
Not at all, these give me the will to keep going.

00:12:25.532 --> 00:12:27.832
I should thank you.

00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:30.665
I'm glad to hear it. Please come again.

Of course. Excuse me.

Let's get going then.

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:46.365
Yes, Sir.

00:12:50.565 --> 00:12:53.240
I bought too much.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:58.632
Only dorayaki? Surely, they have other sweets too.

00:12:58.632 --> 00:13:04.298
You don't know just how good Aiya's dorayaki is.

00:13:04.298 --> 00:13:08.898
Try one? I got some for myself and the office.

00:13:08.898 --> 00:13:12.132
I don't really like red bean paste.

00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:17.732
Why the face?

00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:24.232
You're missing out!

00:13:24.232 --> 00:13:26.665
You're exaggerating.

00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:33.132
But when you eat dorayaki, your whole face lights up.

00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:36.032
I love it.

00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:40.298
You're teasing me again.

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:43.732
I'm not teasing. I really think so.

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:47.032
How can he say that so casually?

00:13:49.998 --> 00:13:53.365
My hands got cold while I was waiting.

00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:56.998
You're so warm.

00:13:56.998 --> 00:13:58.698
Oh... good.

00:13:58.698 --> 00:14:04.098
I can't tell what Soma-kun is thinking at all.

00:14:04.098 --> 00:14:07.532
No, not his girlfriend, she's no match for him.

00:14:07.532 --> 00:14:10.398
I bet you the guy is a model.

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:12.198
Yes, so hot.

00:14:12.198 --> 00:14:14.165
Ogata-san?

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:16.298
Is something wrong?

00:14:18.298 --> 00:14:20.165
Sorry.

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:23.298
I just remembered some work at the office.

00:14:23.298 --> 00:14:24.998
I'll see you.

00:14:39.165 --> 00:14:41.398
So embarrassing.

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:45.632
I was about to misread everything again,

00:14:45.632 --> 00:14:48.032
just like that day...

00:14:52.598 --> 00:14:54.498
Hey, hey!

00:14:54.498 --> 00:14:56.798
Ogata is going to give you chocolate.

00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:59.698
- Who, me?
- Yes.

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.698
No, there's no way.

00:15:01.698 --> 00:15:03.460
Really?

00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:07.598
I mean, she barely counts as a girl.

00:15:07.598 --> 00:15:11.465
True, with that figure.

00:15:11.465 --> 00:15:17.065
We got along so well, I thought he liked me back.

00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:20.998
I had built up the courage to ask him out.

00:15:22.865 --> 00:15:27.365
I was so mortified, I instantly decided to go on a diet.

00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:32.740
I built up walls around myself

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.160
so I wouldn't make the same mistake.

00:15:37.032 --> 00:15:40.732
But once again...

00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:58.765
Kotori-san, thanks for the data.

00:15:58.765 --> 00:16:01.832
This should help with the design.

00:16:01.832 --> 00:16:05.398
No, it was basically all Soma-kun.

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.610
Oh, really?

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.590
Thanks.

00:16:17.765 --> 00:16:22.030
I haven't talked to him at all today.

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:26.732
This is such a slim fit. It surely isn't for everyone.

00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:31.032
The brand is known for that.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.432
Ogata could never wear them.

00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:36.532
What?

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:43.165
True... yes.

00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:48.798
That's weird.

00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:55.298
Chief always teases me like that, but I can't laugh it off now.

00:16:58.098 --> 00:16:59.765
Chief.

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:04.932
That was very rude to Ogata-san. Please take it back.

00:17:06.632 --> 00:17:08.265
Soma-kun?

00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:10.798
Yes, that was out of line!

00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:14.410
Kotori may always go along with what you say,

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.530
but that doesn't mean you can say anything.

00:17:16.532 --> 00:17:17.698
Seriously!

00:17:17.698 --> 00:17:19.598
Got it, Chief?

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:24.398
Sorry, Ogata, I didn't mean it.

00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:26.432
- It's okay...
- Kotori, you can be angry at him.

00:17:26.432 --> 00:17:28.132
- I didn't mean it.
- Come on.

00:17:28.132 --> 00:17:31.198
- Do you understand your wrong?
- Of course, I do.

00:17:31.198 --> 00:17:33.738
- I'm sorry.
- That was sexual harassment.

00:17:33.738 --> 00:17:36.332
- So sorry.
- We will tell your boss.

00:17:36.332 --> 00:17:38.498
I'm really sorry!

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.365
Soma-kun!

00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:55.665
Thanks for earlier.

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:59.065
I just said what I was thinking.

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.465
It's freezing.

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:09.346
Want some of my heat?

00:18:17.098 --> 00:18:23.690
But... You don't like it when I touch you.

00:18:24.398 --> 00:18:27.120
I noticed you seemed off yesterday.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.865
No, I don't dislike it.

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.965
I want to hold hands.

00:18:46.198 --> 00:18:48.165
I...

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.530
When I was younger,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.290
guys hurt me about my weight.

00:19:02.912 --> 00:19:06.746
I struggle with self-confidence to this day.

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:15.402
But I know I can't go on like this, and I need to change.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.665
It really hit me when you stood up for me, Soma-kun.

00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:24.832
So thank you.

00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:30.298
That's silly.

00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:36.832
"Silly"? Come on...

00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:39.530
You don't have to change a thing.

00:19:40.532 --> 00:19:45.065
There's a guy here who likes you the way you are.

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:55.665
Will you go out with me?

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.965
"G-Go out"?

00:20:02.965 --> 00:20:06.498
This is so sudden; I can't process it!

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.098
I'll wait.

00:20:09.898 --> 00:20:12.132
Think about it.

00:20:14.898 --> 00:20:19.465
But I don't want to just sit around.

00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:24.065
Shall we date for a limited trial period?

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:26.165
"Trial period"?

00:20:26.165 --> 00:20:32.265
Let me see... Let's say, a month?

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:36.532
It'll give us a chance to casually get to know each other.

00:20:36.532 --> 00:20:40.298
- Well?
- What do I do?

00:20:40.298 --> 00:20:42.998
Well...

00:20:44.132 --> 00:20:50.698
If you end up liking me, we can make it official.

00:20:50.698 --> 00:20:53.265
But if something goes wrong, we will stop.

00:20:53.265 --> 00:20:55.032
We can stop?

00:20:55.032 --> 00:20:57.632
Well, it is a trial anyway.

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:00.390
Is that what you focus on?

00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:03.160
That hurts.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.360
No, well...

00:21:09.232 --> 00:21:11.132
I...

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:15.898
I've never dated anyone.

00:21:17.565 --> 00:21:21.060
No one has ever asked me this.

00:21:22.132 --> 00:21:24.832
So I'm just a bit shocked.

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:32.632
I've always been afraid of getting hurt and shy about love.

00:21:32.632 --> 00:21:37.798
But... I want to change!

00:21:38.698 --> 00:21:40.365
I...

00:21:45.865 --> 00:21:47.910
Let's do it.

00:21:48.498 --> 00:21:52.532
If it's Soma-kun, then maybe...

00:21:53.565 --> 00:21:56.732
Okay, let's do it then.

00:21:57.565 --> 00:21:59.198
Shake on it?

00:22:03.998 --> 00:22:05.932
It's a deal.

00:22:08.465 --> 00:22:10.798
Wh-What?

00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:13.730
A hug to seal the deal.

00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:17.832
A hug to... what?

00:22:19.198 --> 00:22:25.932
I'm going to try my hardest to make you fall for me.

00:22:30.998 --> 00:22:33.265
So get ready.

00:22:35.765 --> 00:22:38.632
Get ready for what?

00:22:38.632 --> 00:22:44.632
Will he lead me on even more than now?
