The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.060
Nice weather

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.170
how

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.650
Relax a little

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.240
Do you want to go somewhere with me to have some spicy river fish soup?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.180
How about boiled chicken?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.240
At least to this extent, they will believe that you are threatened.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.620
Don't act pitiful

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.890
You're a doctor, you know this level of damage won't kill anyone.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.720
You said you were completely panicked.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.400
I can't remember anything about the driver.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400
Just say he's a man in his twenties

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
They will think it's one of Jin Shijian's men

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.750
All this

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.400
It was all done by Jin Shijian and his gang

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.170
Dr. Yu, listen carefully.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.140
Hello

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.330
Listen carefully

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.010
Like a skilled actor

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.290
Just follow my instructions and play your role well.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.090
What's going on?

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.550
Yu Suzhen

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.980
Hello

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.280
How are you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.430
I was threatened

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.850
I didn't do it voluntarily.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480
We will make a judgment after investigation

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.140
Ye Na Ye...

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.130
What? If you see it, please help.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.750
Why do that?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.910
It's okay. I can do it alone.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.820
Dr. Yu

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.720
Kidnapped by a patient at Basin City Hospital

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.960
I came back injured

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.520
Kidnapping?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.450
How serious the injury

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.010
The prisoner took the hostages and escaped from the hospital

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.800
The surveillance camera didn't capture it at all

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.140
Can this really be considered a coincidence?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.680
No close-up footage

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.660
critical moment

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.230
Only move in blind spots where there are no cameras

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.760
Even the camera at the last exit is under maintenance

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.980
I am a hostage

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.010
How could Jin Shijian act like that?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.780
I have no idea

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.100
Jin Shijian, who had only been hospitalized for a few days

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.850
The possibility of fully understanding the situation and taking action

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.600
How many do you think

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.080
Are you trying to say I planned all this?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.450
Is that why you handcuffed the patient?

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.940
We apologize to you for this.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.110
No, because of Kim Si-gum

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.380
It was so easy and almost no trace left.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.490
Our officer Pan seems to have you

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.400
Mistakenly became Jin Shijian's accomplice

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.200
Didn't you see the footage from the ICU?

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.310
There should be a video of how I became a hostage.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.010
Look, look, look

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.850
I've seen them all.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.550
No matter what, just come back safely.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.870
Medical scissors used as a murder weapon

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.120
How did Jin Shijian get it?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.590
I have no idea

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.970
Where did you get the murder weapon? You police should go and find out.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.370
and

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.290
The police are stationed in the hospital.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.580
But the suspect who escaped could not be controlled

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.630
As a victim, I would like to ask you

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.850
The patient cannot sit for long periods of time while being questioned

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.740
Are you responsible if the condition worsens?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.020
Excuse me, but the prisoner is on the run.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.260
Let's just ask a few quick questions.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.620
I told you, but you didn't understand.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.060
The patient absolutely needs to be in a stable state now.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.050
She is undergoing treatment under great stress.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.590
Pressure?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.680
It's the same now

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.650
Did you see her hands shaking like this?

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.800
The patient is shaking with fear, and you're still reminding her of the crime scene.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.960
It's really violent behavior.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.740
It's really shaking, huh?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.630
Dr. Yu, you should lie down too.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.100
Really

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.110
Let's go

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.270
We'll ask you later

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.390
Please receive treatment

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.370
Let's go

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.790
No, those people are really crazy.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.160
They let the prisoners go themselves.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.310
But they caught the injured person and investigated

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.490
Just an apology isn't enough.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.600
but

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.880
I seem to have seen that young detective somewhere.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.440
That's right

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.120
Didn't he come to our hospital's emergency room?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.940
Then the patient disappeared

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.370
You did what happened to Yu Suzhen, didn't you?

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.220
Like a squirrel. Are you filming Indiana Jones?

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.310
Leave him alone

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.540
He looks like a weakling.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.930
Asking you

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.140
It was you who did this to Jin Shijian, right?

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.470
Didn't you kidnap him in order to kill him?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.270
Are you here to confirm if you don't listen to me and act arbitrarily?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.480
What will it become?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.150
You came at the right time

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.010
Take a look

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.770
You can come closer and take a look

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.660
You at that time

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.570
You should take the medicine yourself.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.900
Do I have to report all these things?

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.550
this

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.790
It looks like a toy, but

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.060
This thing can kill anything, even people.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.620
Jin Shijian was targeted by the police

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.630
Being caught

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.640
The cause of the incident

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.220
It's all because of you

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.000
Now even I'm dangerous.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.640
But why should I endure it?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.750
This guy

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.750
What I received

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.680
Mental and financial losses

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.180
What are you going to do?

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.860
If you want money

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.980
I can find a way to compensate you, but

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.800
If you dare to touch Yu Suzhen again

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.960
I won't sit still then.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.770
Do you think I'm doing this for that little bit of money?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.700
So what do you want?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.900
Good question

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.050
What a good question

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.110
you

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.700
Why do you do this everywhere?

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.960
Representative

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.330
In the world

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.060
Many people don't want to die in pain.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.150
Of course it's illegal now.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.590
But over time

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.650
It may become a matter of choice

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.230
That might also become a human right.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.920
As expected of a medical student, he's quite good at giving briefings.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.060
Good excuse, makes sense.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.630
But since it makes sense

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.630
It might develop into a big business.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.080
Rich people are not

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.480
At least myself

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.130
Will pay a lot of money to choose euthanasia

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.270
This is a completely different ball game than dealing with an addict.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.320
This is a serious business project

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.230
We never thought about it this way.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.710
Come on, bring the champagne.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.290
OK

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.530
Drink it

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.730
You are clean, what are you going to do next?

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.870
You took my medicine during this time and you never tried it once, right?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.430
drink

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.710
Give me a drink

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.040
Done

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.390
Oh, so good.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.430
Really obedient

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.890
You will be happy soon

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.120
You will feel happy after a long time

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.780
-When is the event? -No event

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.650
- Tomorrow? - Have you said anything?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.460
OK, can we watch a movie, have dinner, or something?

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.220
- Am I talking too much in the ER? - Yeah

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.080
Hello, Father

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.160
It's an emergency. I can't contact Dr. Cui right now.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.010
Has Yunxi's condition worsened?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.020
Yes

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.960
Okay, I'll contact Dr. Cui again.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.370
Bastard, how much medicine did you mix in?

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.760
-=Suzhen=-

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.950
Suzhen, I can't answer the phone now.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.130
I'm afraid you'll be scared

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.200
Damn it! How can I be in such a good mood?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.170
As time goes by

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.280
You will become more anxious and depressed

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.340
Self-esteem hits rock bottom

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.860
Where are you going?

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.120
If you leave without permission, I'll be scolded.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.650
Team Leader

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.320
No, where are you going so late?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.290
Do I have to report everything I go to?

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.470
I'm neither a criminal nor a suspect.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.520
I'm worried about you.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.280
You were just taken hostage.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.620
And the hostage has not been arrested yet.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.770
There was an emergency patient at the hospital where I volunteered.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.340
But there are no medical staff now.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.440
But you are also a patient.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.770
Will you push yourself too hard?

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.490
The patient is waiting for me

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.510
so

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.390
You send her there.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.440
I can still protect her. Go with her.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.360
-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.270
Patient, it's ok. Patient

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.540
Komatsu

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.330
Komatsu

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:11.950
Komatsu

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:14.880
You are here

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.810
Xiaosong, you can't stay here.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.410
Thank you, Dr. Yu

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.970
It's okay. It's okay.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.910
It's fine

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.240
It'll be fine soon.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.860
Be patient a little longer

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.330
It's okay, Xiaosong. It's okay.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.330
Lord

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.130
Please take care of those who cannot be near you

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.120
And the poor wandering soul

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.150
It's fine

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.240
Your name is Ban Zhixun instead of Xianyu, right?

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.930
I'm glad you're alive though

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.630
But I feel sorry and guilty about Hyun-woo's death

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.850
After all, I didn't recognize his face.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.190
sorry

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.300
I heard the police are investigating.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.020
So what is Dr. Yu's crime?

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.100
Answer me

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.400
If the police hide their identities and investigate a case

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.120
It shouldn't be a traffic violation, right?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.700
What is it

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.920
What Yu Suzhen is doing now

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.790
No matter what my intention was

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.970
These are things that shouldn't be done

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.340
If you think it's dangerous

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.720
Please contact me

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.830
I don't understand what you are saying

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.960
Although I don't understand

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.960
Anyway, it's not Dr. Yu

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.840
She is a good person

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.240
Because I have known her for a long time, so I know

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.170
There must be some misunderstanding here.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.130
The painkillers are no longer effective.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.230
I calm down now because I'm tired.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.620
Did the children see it?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.380
If I lose consciousness due to the pain

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:24.420
My child sometimes cleans up my urine and feces at home

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.570
If this continues

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.280
When it comes to mom

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.890
The first thing that came to her mind was probably the smell.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.380
The child is still young

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.720
Having my mother by my side brings me great comfort.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.710
The child is already afraid of me

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.630
The adults comforted me and said

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.530
This is how I alienate my children from me before I die.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.980
But I...

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:10.420
I don't want to die being hated by my children.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.180
So

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.390
If I wait until I'm really about to die

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.770
Don't bother with me anymore.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.770
If you could give me a ride, I'd be very grateful.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.150
I am a doctor

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.990
I was diagnosed with stomach cancer

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.660
No money for treatment

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.200
But I have a child

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.350
So there's no way I can just die like this.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.490
I tried my best to survive

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.710
Ask around

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.540
After hearing the word free

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.760
Companies developing new drugs

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.470
Received immunotherapy

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.720
That medicine

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.100
It has a worse effect on people at high risk of diabetes

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.800
Probably.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.220
Have you told the pharmaceutical company?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.220
They said I agreed to it.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.830
They didn't do anything wrong

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.270
That's sorry.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.030
Wait until I die

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.670
Can you help me

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.460
Send the child to a nursery?

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.870
The priest should know a good nursery.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.360
Thanks

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.770
Thanks…

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.070
Dr. Yu

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.300
What's wrong

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.470
Are you injured?

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.870
Are you okay? Do you need help?

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.080
No need, I've already taken care of it.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.940
Are you really okay?

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.880
sorry

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.060
I don't even know your situation.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.820
Please come and help me

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.980
You must be feeling very uncomfortable.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.990
Go home and rest

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.160
Why don't you ask me

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.000
What

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.090
Don't you already know that person is not Zhao Xianyu?

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.140
But the detective who was chasing me

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.660
You never lied to me

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.220
Of course, when I don't want to tell the truth

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.450
You will also keep silent

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.400
If you can be honest, I would also like to ask

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.230
What happened

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.890
Those people think I killed someone

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.750
Is it a medical malpractice or something?

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.560
If you want to hear the real answer

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.250
That's not an accident.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.610
I'll tell you when I've sorted it out.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.960
Lee Yoon-hee's time is running out

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.030
The next few days were the most painful time for her

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.270
I'll stay here tonight

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.370
Although Daxian likes to joke, he is very responsible.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.990
It should come tomorrow

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.960
Hello

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.640
Hello

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.890
Hello, please open the window

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.210
What's going on?

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.590
There was a spasm.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.040
Because of the severe pain, he entered a delirium

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.410
Delirium: A state of frequent severe hyperactivity, anxiety, and tremors

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.190
Please hold her down so she doesn't fall off the bed.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.110
Are the symptoms of cramps so severe?

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.290
The painkillers are no longer effective.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.240
Go away

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.110
I'll stay here anyway.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.260
Detective, the kind of thing you're worried about

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.610
It can't be done in the short term, and I won't do it.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.760
What will happen to this patient then?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.560
If cramps persist

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.890
It would be hard for her to hold on.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.710
-=Guangsou Team Fu Zhexiu=-

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.810
I'm a neighbor. Please open the door.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.510
Why is it so noisy?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.560
Who is it?

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.260
Excuse me

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.160
I didn't allow you to come in.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.390
We are the police

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.110
Are you Choi Dae-hyun?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.640
Yes

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.790
We understand you fell asleep on the road yesterday.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.590
I started working again after many years

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.110
Tired and sleepy

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.790
No accidents happened

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.640
Will I be punished for drowsy driving?

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.240
That's not the case

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.210
But

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.910
We discovered you have a history of drug abuse.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.510
To confirm, come with us to the institute.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.790
No, am I being tortured?

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.340
I'll speak after the lawyer arrives.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.190
I'm sorry to invite you to such a shabby place.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.360
Have you met contestant Choi Kang-yoon?

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.060
Five days before his death

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.490
Yes

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.410
Why did you meet?

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.010
I provide him with consultation

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.690
Help him relieve his pain

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.390
Is providing intelligence also illegal?

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.660
No

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.310
Talking about illegality

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.710
It seems you are very sensitive to the law.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.910
A drug reaction appeared immediately during the simple examination.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.040
Right

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.660
This is just a simple check

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.940
So we're going to do a formal inspection.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.710
It's already like this, why don't you speak up?

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.910
I'll talk after the lawyer arrives.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.740
I can't contact your mother either.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.060
He seems very disappointed with his son.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.910
You continue

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.040
I won't say anything until the lawyer comes.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.540
Lawyer Lawyer

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.160
Are you a parrot?

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.240
Give his mother another call.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.960
She said her son was begging for help like a bird.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.140
OK

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.990
Even with sedatives, the spasms wouldn't stop.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.360
There's no other method available.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.340
Dr. Yu, you have tried your best.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.510
I'll take care of her until she dies.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.340
You should take a rest.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.560
The child is afraid of his mother and dares not approach her.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.140
She saves money on insulin

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.110
To save money for the kids to buy an extra meal

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.540
Will the child remember the mother's kindness?

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.190
Do you remember saying

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.160
There's a reason for all the pain, is it all we can do?

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.040
Yes

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.960
Then those who cannot gain any understanding in pain

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.990
Is he a sinner?

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.110
this....

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.090
All I can say is

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.190
Life and death are the domain of God

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.140
I heard that God uses human hands to exert his power.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.860
That's the way God uses

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.390
Although you are a doctor who saves lives

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.240
But that's arrogant.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.510
You are shirking your responsibility.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.640
Choosing a life of obedience is not an easy choice after all

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.990
For difficult-to-treat patients

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.560
What can I do for them as a doctor?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.390
Only to alleviate their suffering

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.410
If the only way to relieve pain is death

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.560
So this kind of treatment is not allowed?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.810
You said it, right?

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.910
I want to know why the police suspect me.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.340
If the only treatment available to a patient left with only pain

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.910
If it is death

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.540
I want to give them that kind of treatment, Father.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.560
Mary

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.490
I'm not Mary anymore.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.260
Because I no longer believe in God

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.990
finally

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.740
The lawyer you've been looking for so hard

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.840
It's finally here

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.160
It seems your mother hasn't completely abandoned you.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.090
She hired such a famous lawyer for you

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.190
You were once a famous plastic surgeon.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.160
But after taking medicine and undergoing surgery

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.940
The famous singer's face...

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.740
After public opinion worsened, your medical license was revoked.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.190
I refuse personal attention

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.410
Because it's so beautiful

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.660
I'm talking about the necklace

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:50.210
Isn't it my face?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.040
You are also very beautiful

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.810
Although you should know

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.510
Most doctors after being punished

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.390
You can file a lawsuit and re-qualify after three years.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.890
But you haven't stopped taking the medicine before?

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.010
There is no lawsuit to restore the qualification certificate.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.640
I'm too busy.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.490
The simple test showed positive

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.590
Where do you get the confidence to keep denying it?

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.910
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.560
terribly sorry

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.090
Have we met somewhere before?

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.890
You look familiar

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.460
Compared to those men who hit on me by saying I look like my mother

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.840
Your trick is pretty good.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.910
Aunt Caiyan's friend

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.360
Jae-yeon's aunt Woo So-jeong

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.960
Are you Dr. Yu's friend?

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.760
Do you know Suzhen and Caiyan?

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.260
It seems you changed offices.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.890
No

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.460
There's a reason for everything

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.690
Even if it's an emergency arrest for drug use

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.040
After 48 hours, it becomes an illegal arrest.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.040
Don't you want to apply for a detention warrant?

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.810
Of course you have to apply.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.260
What are you doing?

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.710
My client is not involved in drug trafficking.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.910
The identity is also very clear

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.710
Why conduct the survey in this way?

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.940
Choi Dae-hyun is not a drug offender

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.140
But suspected of murder

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.010
Killing people?

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.860
You and I, the lawyer, can get along well.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.690
Just tell you the truth

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.290
We think Choi Dae-hyun is a college classmate of his who is a doctor

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.390
An accomplice in a murder case

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.390
What are you doing?

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.290
If the person is detained for investigation,

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.040
At least tell me the details of the case accurately.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.510
So I'm telling you now?

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.110
Please tell me everything

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.010
This is something I should know as a lawyer.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.460
We believe

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.510
Dr. Yu Suzhen from Basin City Hospital

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.560
-=Suspects Yu Suzhen, Choi Daxian, and Choi Kangyun's attending physician=-

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.360
Involving murder under the guise of euthanasia

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.610
At the same time, we believe that Choi Dae-hyun is her accomplice.
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.340
Why are you hiding from me?

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.310
If you know everything, why are you still chatting with me?

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.460
Because there's one thing you have to do.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.060
You go tell the dance teacher I'm on drugs

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.040
The fainting during the performance

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.790
It's not because of weight loss, and it's not because of nervousness

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.940
Why should I promise you

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.190
Because the teacher

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.260
Said I ruined the performance because of nervousness

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.360
She's worried about me playing the leading role.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.190
So,

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.240
Why should my aunt be affected by you?

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.210
You took that medicine without permission.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.460
They took it from our house without permission.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.240
Who is your aunt if she keeps that kind of stuff at home?

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.640
Isn't she wrong?

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.540
She used it to euthanize animals.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.290
You took the medicine without permission

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:34.540
The attitude is too upright.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.460
Hello

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.540
That's what your aunt told me to say.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.110
Although I did steal the medicine

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.110
But your aunt asked me to keep it a secret.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.260
Think about it

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.490
The doctor examined

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.210
Don't you know why I fainted?

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.240
She knew it, but she still lied.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240
Do you understand?

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.990
I don't believe you

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:31.730
Huh

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.290
Dad comes home so late

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.000
Father

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.230
Father

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.010
Please save me from evil

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.020
Please also save me from temptation. Please...

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.820
Hello, I can't do it now.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.420
I'm in church

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.540
I am Michael

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.940
I was baptized

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:50.760
What

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.570
Edible condoms...

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:55.870
What

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.080
Do you have candied haws flavor?

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.690
Sorry, Tanghulu

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.480
Hello, I'll be there right after I finish praying.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.150
Yeah, wait for me

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.380
Don't eat it, eh?

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.800
Father

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.220
Please save me from my wife.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.670
Just don't let me be nailed to the cross.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.580
I'll just taste it

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.270
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:42.970
Hello

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.630
As a lawyer, you should know better.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.610
Keep confidentiality for the client

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.530
You absolutely cannot tell anyone around you.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.090
About Aunt Caiyan

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.790
As a lawyer, I'm telling you

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.540
The police said if you can help them catch Yu Suzhen

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.370
It will reduce your sentence.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.520
Of course, I didn't say this directly.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.020
But he offered me a deal as a lawyer.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.820
Do not contact Yu Suzhen without my permission.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.160
Of course, I can't see her.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.100
Say you're traveling and then cut off contact

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.950
Suzhen and I just participated in volunteer activities together.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.560
And during that process, consultation was conducted...

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.700
You are suspected of involvement in a murder case

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.970
Really

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.910
I don't want my client to protect others.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.750
Increase the penalty

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.350
If you want me, as a lawyer, to keep it secret

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.240
Then do it according to the method I proposed.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.940
Otherwise I won't defend you.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.210
but

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.000
I can't agree to the conditions the police said.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.070
If I could help them capture Yu Suzhen,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.860
Never say it again.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.030
I don't need a lawyer who makes this kind of suggestion.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:54.900
but

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.720
I will listen to your advice to keep our distance for now.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.370
Don't you like me?

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.900
You just like me

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.840
But I ask you this

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.930
Don't you promise me?

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.610
I can't let my aunt suffer because of you

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.590
Hey, are you crazy?

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.870
Hello, Youmei, what are you doing?

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.750
Ah, what should I do?

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.470
Hey, what did I see?

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.120
No, how could you suddenly force...

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.560
Are you crazy?

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.720
No, it wasn't me.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.670
Are you okay?

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.740
Are you crazy?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.860
-=Dr. Yu Suzhen=-

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.110
Yes, Dr. Yu

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.570
You called because of Lee Yoon Hee, right?

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.560
I was just about to call you.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.200
Lee Yoon Hee went to heaven not long ago

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.940
Is there anything I can help with?

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.740
Need not

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.480
It's okay. I'll work with the welfare staff here.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.480
Deal with follow-up matters

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.100
I will send the child to a nursery run by a priest I know well.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.050
Dr. Yu, thank you for your concern.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.760
Don't think about anything else now

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.930
Have a good rest

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:05.600
good

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.410
I've checked the surveillance camera and there's no video captured.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:25.270
I will look for other witnesses among the patients.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.100
good

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:33.780
When did you disappear?

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.750
Is she out of school?

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.790
Bao is still in school. I thought she was in school.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:39.720
But no

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.620
-=Emergency Room No Entry or Exit=-
Is there any place you can think of where Jaeyeon could go?

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.440
What happened?

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.340
What's going on?

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.670
The child is missing

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:02.930
Get on the bus

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.310
Get in the car

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.980
Do you really like women?

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.070
So you want to date me?

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:24.870
Do you really like women?

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.180
Cai Yan

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:14.900
sorry

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.390
I didn't realize it was so late.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.080
Thanks

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.820
Thank you today

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.390
You're welcome

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.500
Fortunately I found it

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.940
How did the patient who had severe convulsions do?

Lee Yoon-hee

good

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.980
This is my real phone number.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.650
If there is an emergency with your child

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.120
You can contact me

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.050
As a police officer, I can help you with these matters.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.750
Thanks

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.680
My name is Pan Zhixun

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.640
We have identified you as a criminal and are investigating.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.180
You think so of me too

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.340
I will definitely arrest you

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.950
Then you will be punished according to the number of crimes you have committed.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:15.060
You're destroying yourself in order to save others

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.060
What to do? I can already see the child's head.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.030
May give birth while moving

Doctor, her vital signs are fine, her oxygen saturation is 95.

Come on, work harder, work harder

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.680
Work harder. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.320
Take a deep breath. Yes, that's right. Take a deep breath.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.030
You're doing great, maternity.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.600
Come on, come on.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.540

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.400
Thank you very much

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.050
Ah, Dr. Yu, you're here.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.280
Lee Yoon-hee's child

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.470
I wonder where she was sent.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.430
I want to give her this

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:23.310
Where did she go?

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.480
The place I want to go seems

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.690
It hasn't been decided yet

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.610
blue sky

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.890
Blue Dream

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:36.550
On a green hill

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.880
There are many goats

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.320
Playing on the grass

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.280
With a face as cheerful as the blue sky

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.540
In the raindrops

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.860
In the falling weather

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.570
They all frowned and looked miserable.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.350
Go find mommy

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.340
Go find daddy

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.220
Sad face

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.960
The sun flickers

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.390
Beautifully illuminated

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:12.790
It seems I've waited too long.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.270
Plop, plop, grunt, grunt

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.920
Staggering and grunting

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.850
Why did you lie to me?

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.860
You know very well that on a medical level

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.110
There is no other way

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:33.720
A life of obedience is also beautiful

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.540
You're so irresponsible, like back then

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.020
- Eat more. - Okay.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.180
The song just now

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.140
Is the song sung just for mom to hear?

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.310
Because the nuns will listen

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.500
My mother likes my singing

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:07.470
I see

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.060
But Komatsu

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.390
I

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.470
Because I have no strength

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.920
I don't think I can save your mother.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:34.720
sorry

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.610
I know too

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.530
I think my mom has gone to heaven.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.590
Why do you think so?

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.960
It's what my mother said

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.320
When you are sick

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.490
Mom is not a real mom

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.920
No matter what she says, don't make me sad

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.340
What happens when mom is sick?

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.210
Will yell

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.260
Will curse

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:08.860
Get angry

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:11.520
My mother said

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.470
Just let me remember

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.840
What she said when she wasn't sick

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.000
So

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.670
Can I let Mom go now?

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.280
I need medicine

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.770
You crazy person

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:09.900
Dr. Yu

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:12.150
The person making the request

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.270
Not you, but me

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.720
Someone is suffering and needs medication.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.680
Damn

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.460
You guys get out

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.050
Are you crazy?

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.640
When being chased by the police like this

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.790
You still have to do that

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:38.620
Is it because of a job that involves seeing blood every day?

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.340
So you're getting bolder?

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.790
Are you crazy?

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.080
Please

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.060
In this world

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.760
Many people don't want to die in pain.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.160
Ah, yes, of course it's illegal now.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.380
But as time goes by

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.630
This may be a matter of choice.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:05.350
It may become a human right

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:09.440
Who is the patient?

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.910
This is an emergency. I'll explain later.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:13.760
Damn

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.660
Hello

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:17.760
Listen to me carefully

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.760
If you want to continue doing that

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.370
You need my permission

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.240
You want to

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:27.770
When, where and who to kill

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.340
Do it right in front of me.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.900
You want to kill

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.360
Where is the person you wanted to kill?

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:38.410
-=Wide Area Search Team Li Daojun has sent you the information you requested about Yu Suzhen. Please confirm.=-

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.760
I sent you the information about Yu Suzhen you wanted.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.660
Please confirm

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.580
Where is the person you wanted to kill?

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.680
I have to see it for myself.

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:21.210
That way I can decide whether to use my stuff or not

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.720
I make the decision, not you.

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.420
This is what Zhixun applied for.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.020
The information about Yu Suzhen and Father Yang has been sent over.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:35.900
Where is Ji-hoon?

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.880
I left immediately after confirmation.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.720
Unable to contact

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.010
What is the information

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.080
Yu Suzhen and Father Yang

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.230
It seems like we've known each other since we were very young.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:46.030
It started when Yu Suzhen was Yu Caiying

00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:47.830
Who is Yu Caiying?

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.780
Yu Suzhen changed her name at the age of 18

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.430
Woo Chae-young changed to Woo Su-jeong

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:54.640
-Why? -My mother with cancer

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.160
Yu Suzhen died when she was 16 years old

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.590
Did you change your name because your mother passed away?

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.110
Yu Suzhen is a strong suspect in the murder of her mother

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.880
The conclusion is suicide

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.940
But it was initially suspected to be murder.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.200
How did he die? It's suspected to be murder.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.480
Where is Dr. Yu Suzhen?

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.610
What's up?

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.280
Doctor Yu is off work.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.600
He fell into a lake near his home and died.

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:23.420
Drowned with hands tied behind the back

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.860
When did you find out your mother was missing?

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:37.280
I found out this morning

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:39.900
I knew she would jump into the lake.

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.440
So I jumped into the lake to save her

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.690
Finally failed

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.810
She committed suicide

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:52.800
Mom always wants to die

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:54.540
Then you didn't see her

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.530
When and how did you jump into the water?

00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:58.860
yes

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.510
Weren't your hands tied behind your back when you were found?

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.710
How was it tied?

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.880
Did you help your mother tie it?

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:14.900
I wanted to save my mother.

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:41.690
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.040
Woo Chae-young, why did you change your name?

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.000
Wasn't it you, Yu Suzhen, who tied up your mother's hands?

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.850
Mother
Didn't I say that?

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.620
It's impossible to live in peace like this

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:53.980
Let's let the child die.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.640
This place is hell

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.870
Is that the beginning?

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:01.190
You think everything that happens around me is my fault

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.290
Now you have to give up hope of being acquitted of the murder charge.

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.170
Please help me convince Yu Suzhen to confess everything.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:10.670
Urgently arrest you as the suspect in the Lee Yun-hee murder case.
