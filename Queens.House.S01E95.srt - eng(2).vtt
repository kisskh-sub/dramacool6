00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:04.271
You have terminal stomach cancer.

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:14.411
What do you mean?

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.381
Terminal stomach cancer?

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:23.051
Doctor, you can't be serious.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.851
If it's terminal, how am I walking?

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:35.961
Are you sure you ran the tests correctly?

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.931
You could've mixed up my results with someone else's.

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:42.541
If you'd like, we can run the tests again, but...

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.841
If you look here,

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:52.981
the cancer has already spread widely to your abdominal lining.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.891
Why me?

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:01.821
Does a little stomachache automatically mean it's cancer?

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.701
I just decided to start living.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.331
But what?

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:12.231
You're telling me it's cancer?

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:23.511
No, that can't be right.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.521
Are you even a real specialist?

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:30.221
Did you even diagnose me correctly?

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.521
The cancer has already spread widely throughout your body,

00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:05.921
so we've missed the window for surgery or chemotherapy.

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.361
How much time do I have left?

00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:15.561
Right now, I'd say a year at the most.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:19.531
But depending on the spread, it could be six months or three.

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.471
I can't say for sure.

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.990
The person you called is unreachable.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.121
Connecting to voicemail...

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.801
Why are you waiting around again? Don't you have work to do?

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.771
Did he really not say anything about when he'd be back?

00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.371
No, he didn't.

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:02.280
We'll call you if we hear anything. Call us if you catch him.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.281
I'll talk to you again.

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:07.751
Attorney Seo Jin Ho returned to the country and was caught,

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.151
but then he got away.

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:12.191
He returned?

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:14.321
I guess he never thought he'd get caught.

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.591
He probably didn't expect the Interpol Red Notice.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.361
He emigrated with his family a while ago.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.631
He probably got complacent and decided to enter the country.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:27.001
They say he ran off without even grabbing his luggage,

00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:31.371
so Wang Sik thinks he'll be caught soon since he's a wanted man.

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:35.111
If Attorney Seo confesses the fraud against Jae In's mom...

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:36.681
was Hwang Gi Chan's doing,

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.880
it'll boost the motion to dismiss Chairman Hwang...

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:40.151
at the general meeting.

00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:42.851
We have to catch him.

00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.821
Once Wang Sik is on a case, he never lets go for anyone.

00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:50.161
So let's just wait and see. I've got to run.

00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:58.131
Hwang Gi Chan. His removal motion is sure to pass,

00:03:58.401 --> 00:03:59.401
so don't worry.

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:14.451
What's this?

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.351
I saw these, and they were beautiful.

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:18.221
They reminded me of you, so I bought them.

00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.521
I hope they make you happy all day while you work.

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.561
Thank you.

00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.741
What's going on with you two?

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:35.441
Are you two already at that stage?

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.441
Adults move way faster than I thought these days.

00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:42.981
Kang Seung Woo. Stop messing around.

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.481
I'm not messing around.

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:48.051
So, how was your date with my sister?

00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.721
Excellent! It was a lot of fun.

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.621
It wasn't just me having fun, right?

00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:59.061
Yes, I had a good time, too.

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:18.381
Do you mean it?

00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:20.551
Do I look like I'm kidding?

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.581
Let me try again, seriously, this time.

00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:26.051
Mi Ran, let's get married.

00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:30.060
It's been such a long and winding road...

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:31.161
to get to this point.

00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:33.461
We were so young back then.

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.171
We're not getting any younger, and we don't have forever.

00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.871
Don't you think it's a waste to let time slip away like this?

00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.341
I know convincing your sister is going to take time,

00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:46.471
and we need to give her that time.

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.981
We're too old to let our families dictate our lives,

00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:56.321
but it can't hurt to show them how sincere their future son-in-law is.

00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:01.691
Just give me some time.

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.331
Sure.

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.131
I'm not pressuring you. Take all the time you need to think.

00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.341
Here, drink this, and let's pretend this didn't happen.

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:20.281
Okay, I will.

00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.951
You're back at work and starting to seem like a real grown-up.

00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:26.621
I've always been a grown-up.

00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:31.651
I say that because I'd skip work for personal reasons all the time,

00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.191
and I've learned that being an adult means facing problems responsibly.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:39.561
Not that I'm proud of it, but you're not the only one.

00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.661
That's all I'm trying to say.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.901
Thanks for the very "adult" advice.

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.381
Thank you.

00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:03.181
How is it? Did I get the water right?

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.121
It's good.

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.261
I got hooked on this in Korea.

00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:11.591
It was hard to get the water right,

00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:14.631
but I guess I got the hang of it since I drink it so often.

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.941
Should I know anything about Jae In and you?

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:30.251
I figured I should double-check to ensure fair play.

00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:35.981
If she's seeing someone, I don't want to overstep my bounds.

00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:40.421
If she were to start seeing someone,

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.460
Jae In would be the one to draw the line first...

00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.031
to keep you from crossing any lines.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.731
That answer just raises more questions,

00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:53.371
but I won't press the issue.

00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:59.271
Gathering intel on a competitor doesn't do me any good either.

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.031
It was you, wasn't it?

00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.561
You told Gi Chan to turn himself in?

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:22.231
And you're the one who pressured him to get a divorce.

00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:27.241
Instead of coming after me, wouldn't it be faster to ask him?

00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:32.141
Why are you so desperate to have what's mine?

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.811
You said you weren't interested!

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.550
You promised not to, so why do you keep doing this?

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.051
How pathetic.

00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:44.251
Do you really think what you have is actually yours?

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.121
If not mine, then whose is it?

00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:48.121
I'm warning you.

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.431
Both Hwang Gi Chan and YL Group are mine.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.691
So don't you dare touch them.

00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:57.901
I will never get a divorce. Ji Ho is my son.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:59.401
I'll never let you take him from me.

00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.641
Trash belongs in the trash can.

00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:08.211
Why'd it take me so long to realize such a simple concept?

00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:13.451
I was a fool to fall for your whole friendship act.

00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:19.221
Did you even tell Gi Chan that he's not Ji Ho's biological father?

00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:23.431
What nonsense are you spouting? He is Gi Chan's son!

00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:28.801
Right, keep insisting. That's so you, Kang Se Ri.

00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:31.701
That'll make your fall from grace all the more spectacular.

00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.171
Why do you think I got you out of that mental hospital?

00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:42.911
I'll be sure to show you what torment really is soon.

00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:47.021
You think that's going to scare me?

00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:49.151
You must have forgotten.

00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:52.591
I was the one who sent you to the abyss.

00:10:11.141 --> 00:10:12.971
Why are you here again today?

00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:15.341
I didn't come to see you, Princess.

00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.151
I came to clean.

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:20.821
The dust is bad for you. You'll get sick, Princess.

00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:24.691
Come, sit here.

00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:29.491
But I really did come to clean.

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.191
I'm not a bad person like my mom.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.731
I won't do anything you don't like.

00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.671
I just came to see you, Princess. That's the truth.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:45.441
Then how about this? Let's meet when you're a grown-up.

00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:49.181
Let's meet when you're an adult, Hwang Gi Man.

00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:53.410
Can I see you if I grow up, Princess?

00:10:53.411 --> 00:10:56.551
Can I see you every single day whenever I miss you?

00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:59.291
Yes, that's right.

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:03.791
Then I'll be a grown-up. I want to be a grown-up.

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:07.660
A grown-up has to be patient, even if they miss someone.

00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:10.871
You can't skip hospital or therapy, and you must work hard on treatment.

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:14.671
You also have to study hard again and be a smarter brother to Ji Ho.

00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:20.041
But I hate the hospital, and I hate getting treatment.

00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:21.941
I hate studying, too.

00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:26.581
Growing up is doing things you hate and knowing how to be patient.

00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:28.750
Becoming a grown-up...

00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:31.391
also means you can't always do whatever you want.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:35.961
If I don't grow up, I can't see you, Princess?

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:41.900
Once you accomplish what you must as a grown-up...

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.301
and start living your life again,

00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:46.171
we can meet then.

00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:50.171
Then...

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.271
Promise me.

00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:56.911
Promise you'll meet me for sure when I'm a grown-up.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.251
I promise.

00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:07.061
That crazy bastard. Cutting ties with his family?

00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:11.291
He's so obsessed with that woman, he's completely blind to his family.

00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.961
After everything I did to raise him?

00:12:15.361 --> 00:12:18.071
That Kang Jae In is a total vixen.

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:19.931
This is so unfair.

00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.171
It's so unfair.

00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:26.471
You're early.

00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:28.011
Come and sit down.

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:32.611
I've been wronged, and I demand an apology.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.251
How long are you going to keep ignoring your mother?

00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.221
Are you looking down on me because I lost six million dollars?

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.961
I said, come here so we can talk!

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.361
Darn it.

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:51.331
Don't forget, I'm still your mother. Got it?

00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:54.541
I'm Noh Sook Ja.

00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.541
Let's see who wins this fight. Bring it on.

00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:00.841
Why you...

00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:19.731
You weren't at work and didn't answer.

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.561
Where have you been all day?

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:23.601
What are you trying to do?

00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:27.771
You don't care if I expose everything you've done?

00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:31.171
Do you really intend to go to jail?

00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:37.351
Honey! Say something. Anything.

00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:52.591
I don't think he's going to eat. He won't even answer me.

00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.961
My goodness. Why does he get to act like this?

00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:58.171
Mother, he's been acting really strange lately.

00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:00.571
He even asked me for a divorce.

00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.741
That's music to my ears. He's clearly so sick of you.

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.841
If I were you, I'd demand a divorce.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.741
Don't you have any pride?

00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:12.051
He's going to turn himself in. Can you believe that?

00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:14.081
He'll confess he killed Kim Do Hee.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.751
Talk some sense into him, Mother.

00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:18.951
He can't be in his right mind.

00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:23.591
Don't tell me he's shooting himself in the foot on purpose.

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:27.761
Since she's been using that to blackmail him,

00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:30.601
he's playing the "so sue me" card to get rid of her.

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.271
That's my boy.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.841
The nerve of her, trying to blackmail him.

00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:40.041
Mother, are you even listening to me?

00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:43.041
I'm home.

00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:48.121
These kids are always protesting, going on hunger strikes on a whim.

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.651
You think I can't do the same?

00:14:51.021 --> 00:14:53.791
I'll starve myself until I'm nothing but skin and bones,

00:14:53.861 --> 00:14:56.221
and maybe they'll finally come to their senses when I drop dead.

00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:57.931
What "ungratefull" children.

00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:00.831
Isn't it "ungrateful?"

00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:04.631
Gosh, my mom is so dramatic.

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.141
Mom, you should eat.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.950
Trust me, I've tried starving myself,

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:19.651
and you're only hurting yourself.

00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:23.551
Are you really on a hunger strike?

00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:27.191
No way. Mom, are you crying?

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:30.961
My goodness.

00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:34.831
Mom. I thought you were going to starve?

00:15:36.931 --> 00:15:38.171
At least I know how to bluff.

00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:41.840
Even if I don't say anything,

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:44.710
after you get chubby after gorging on puffed rice,

00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:47.181
Gi Chan will know.

00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.411
My goodness.

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:56.781
Come down and eat some food.

00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:43.030
The mail sorter from earlier...

00:16:43.031 --> 00:16:44.871
said this was for you, Jae In, and left it here.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.781
Who on earth would do this?

00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:04.521
Jae In, are you okay?

00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:07.421
Yes.

00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.701
It was you, wasn't it?

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.171
What are you on about now?

00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:26.571
Who else would do a thing like this but you?

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:33.381
Whose handiwork is this?

00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:35.751
It's a masterpiece.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.421
It's cute, but the message is crystal clear.

00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:43.091
"Kang Jae In,"

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.491
"I'm coming for you and your family."

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.661
That's the gist of it, right?

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:54.771
Are you confessing that you did this?

00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:58.241
You think I'd waste my time with a childish prank like this now?

00:17:58.671 --> 00:18:01.311
When even blinding you isn't enough,

00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:03.041
you think I'd settle for a picture?

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:06.551
Still, it's a relief.

00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:09.751
If I alone wanted you dead, it would be a lot to handle.

00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:14.261
Looks like I'm not the only one who wants you to disappear.

00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:37.681
Hey, Gi Chan. Come on, let's play!

00:18:41.081 --> 00:18:42.081
Gi Man.

00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:45.151
I'm in a lot of pain.

00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.691
Where does it hurt?

00:18:50.691 --> 00:18:51.961
You feel the same.

00:18:55.631 --> 00:18:57.501
I'm not feeling well, so please leave.

00:19:18.521 --> 00:19:19.721
A present for me?

00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.691
It's an apron.

00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:28.730
I was buying a new one for my house...

00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:31.071
and thought I'd get one for you too.

00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:36.201
Thank you. They make pretty aprons these days.

00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:40.711
I know, right? Even aprons are a fashion statement.

00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:42.881
The new designs are so pretty.

00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:46.511
I'm not giving it to you to make you do more chores.

00:19:46.781 --> 00:19:50.581
I just hoped it would make them a little more pleasant.

00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:54.791
How do I look?

00:19:55.121 --> 00:19:57.561
It brightens you up, and it looks great.

00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:02.331
Do I tie it in the back?

00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:04.101
Let me help you.

00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:05.871
Thanks.

00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:16.411
There we go.

00:20:20.111 --> 00:20:21.421
Thanks.

00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:25.051
We're home!

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:27.321
You've got such a strong voice.

00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.121
I told her I was feeling good today,

00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:31.890
but if I step away even for a second from her,

00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:34.061
she'll scream her heart out for me.

00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:38.531
I made sure Grandma Ja Young wouldn't get lost,

00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:40.271
so I held her hand tight the whole way here.

00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:42.401
Good girl.

00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:44.541
Did you get us some yummy ice cream?

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:48.581
Yes, for you and Grandpa Min Jun,

00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:50.441
I bought them the same kind as Bo Ram's.

00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:58.191
Goodness. That's so nice of you.

00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:02.461
Thank you, Bo Ram. I will enjoy this.

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:03.721
Okay.

00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:09.261
- Registering your marriage? - Yes.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.071
First, I was curious about how you'd feel.

00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:16.371
Of course you should. Congratulations, you two.

00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:18.541
So when's the wedding?

00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:20.171
Where will you go for your honeymoon?

00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:25.981
Well, the thing is...

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.551
My older sister...

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:29.621
So she'd be your aunt.

00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:33.121
You met her at my house for dinner.

00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:37.121
She's my only sister and is like a mother to me.

00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:42.431
I was a complete mess after we broke up.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.871
It really left a scar on my sister.

00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:49.201
There's a right way to end things,

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.941
and it was mostly my fault.

00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:55.711
Listen, I don't care about having a big wedding.

00:21:56.341 --> 00:22:00.481
If we do have one, I want Oh Seong's family's blessing.

00:22:03.421 --> 00:22:06.251
We can always do it later, so I'm okay with that.

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:10.491
Is she really that against it?

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:13.830
These are old feelings.

00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:15.261
They're not going to go away easily.

00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:18.201
She accepts you since you're her nephew,

00:22:19.231 --> 00:22:21.441
but she isn't ready to open her heart to her yet.

00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:25.341
And I understand why she feels that way,

00:22:25.671 --> 00:22:29.741
but finding each other again after a long time has to be fate.

00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.911
And this time, there's one thing I know for sure.

00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:39.321
I love Kang Mi Ran more deeply than I ever did before.

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:52.601
I don't want to break up again over my family's disapproval.

00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:57.641
So, I felt I needed to prove my feelings more definitively.

00:22:58.141 --> 00:23:02.081
So I think we should register first. What do you think?

00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:07.211
What's there to even ask? I'm a hundred percent behind you.

00:23:31.341 --> 00:23:33.641
You've been sitting here all day with all the lights off?

00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:39.251
What happened?

00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:42.881
You've been so out of it all day. What's gotten into you?

00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:45.691
Honey.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.091
Why are you acting like this?

00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:49.661
Is it because you're scared?

00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:53.031
Scared that I'll actually give the dashcam footage to the police?

00:23:54.631 --> 00:23:57.901
You're Ji Ho's father. Why would I make you a criminal?

00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.801
I have no intention of doing that.

00:24:00.701 --> 00:24:03.001
It's just that you keep pushing me away,

00:24:04.141 --> 00:24:06.711
and you asked for a divorce, so I said it without thinking.

00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:08.681
I was at my wits' end.

00:24:10.141 --> 00:24:11.211
Honey,

00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:12.981
this is so hard for me.

00:24:14.111 --> 00:24:18.091
If you just call off the divorce, we wouldn't have to fight like this.

00:24:21.091 --> 00:24:23.821
- Fine, let's do that. - What?

00:24:25.331 --> 00:24:26.761
Let's forget about it.

00:24:27.701 --> 00:24:30.531
Getting custody is pointless for me.

00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:34.701
If I'm gone, it's better if his birth mother raises him.

00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:37.641
Do you really mean that?

00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:39.471
Yes.

00:24:40.211 --> 00:24:41.811
I'm going to withdraw the divorce suit.

00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:46.451
- Honey. - Ji Ho.

00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:50.221
Don't worry about me. Just take good care of Ji Ho.

00:24:50.881 --> 00:24:53.051
I'm calling off the divorce for his sake.

00:24:54.191 --> 00:24:55.261
Leave.

00:24:57.491 --> 00:24:59.761
Okay. Get some rest.

00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:16.081
We're here.

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:18.051
You really didn't have to.

00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:19.851
I'm worried because of that package.

00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.221
Don't go anywhere alone for now.

00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:23.651
Let's commute to and from work together.

00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:28.421
I have plenty of defense items you gave me. See?

00:25:29.491 --> 00:25:32.461
- You don't have to worry. - I can't do that.

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.801
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:39.371
Okay. Thank you.

00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:43.301
- Go on in. - Get home safe.

00:26:15.071 --> 00:26:16.441
Why isn't Gi Chan coming down?

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:19.611
I think Gi Chan's taking time off. He's postponed all his meetings.

00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:24.611
I'm the Chairman's secretary, so why am I working if he's not?

00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:26.681
- Anyway, I'm off. - Okay.

00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:32.251
I don't think Gi Chan is well. He's just lying in the dark.

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:36.091
He'll snap at you if you bother him, so just leave him alone.

00:26:38.561 --> 00:26:42.301
Darn it. She acts like I'm scared of my son.

00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:43.361
Gosh.

00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:50.601
You can't go! You promised.

00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:52.571
What is he talking about? What's gotten into him?

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.081
I said you can't!

00:26:57.581 --> 00:26:59.651
You have to keep your promise to the Princess.

00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:01.921
What are you doing?

00:27:05.321 --> 00:27:07.091
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do.

00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:08.891
You have to bear it to be an adult.

00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:10.821
I said, what are you doing?

00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:14.601
I am becoming an adult.

00:27:15.161 --> 00:27:19.801
Gi Man. Should we wish to see the Princess?

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.501
How do you make a wish?

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:26.011
Grandma. How do you make a wish?

00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:31.451
You can wish on purified water or on a shooting star.

00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:33.051
There are lots of ways to do it.

00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:35.051
What else? What other ways are there?

00:27:35.781 --> 00:27:38.821
There's that thing with cranes, paper cranes or something.

00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:42.721
I heard if you fold 1,000 of them and jar them, a wish comes true.

00:27:43.721 --> 00:27:46.261
Let's do that one! Ji Ho, let's fold them together!

00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:47.961
Let's go!

00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:54.370
You need money to give generous alms,

00:27:54.371 --> 00:27:58.011
make big offerings, and make a ton of wishes.

00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:00.311
Darn it.

00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:03.411
Today's the board meeting, right?

00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:08.021
As soon as we get a majority vote in today's meeting,

00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:10.151
I'm posting the notice for the special shareholders' meeting.

00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:12.321
We'll definitely get a majority, don't you think?

00:28:14.091 --> 00:28:19.161
Before, people were too afraid of Hwang Gi Chan to even meet with us.

00:28:19.861 --> 00:28:22.161
But this time, once I made my move,

00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.771
some even asked to meet me first.

00:28:27.231 --> 00:28:30.171
By the way, I heard Hwang Gi Chan hasn't been coming in to work.

00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:32.141
Do you know anything about that?

00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:33.671
I'm not sure.

00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:37.281
When I contacted the board members, they didn't say anything specific.

00:28:37.511 --> 00:28:40.211
He canceled today's meeting with us as well.

00:28:41.111 --> 00:28:43.081
He doesn't have another trick up his sleeve, does he?

00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:45.621
I tried to feel Hwang Na Ra out,

00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:48.021
but she said he wasn't feeling well.

00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:51.531
Whatever it is, let him try it. Even if he has another trick,

00:28:51.591 --> 00:28:53.631
he's in the palm of your hand anyway, right, Jae In?

00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:56.000
That's right.

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:59.171
I'll make sure he can't do anything in the palm of my hand.

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:43.181
Dad, please feel better. Dad, I love you.

00:29:57.021 --> 00:29:58.031
Ji Ho?

00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:14.271
Where is Ji Ho?

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:37.001
Ji Ho.

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.911
Ji Ho, why are you on a chair? It's dangerous.

00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:47.971
I'm trying to get a book.

00:30:49.011 --> 00:30:50.011
What book?

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:54.581
The other day, Uncle put a book up there,

00:30:54.681 --> 00:30:58.251
and he told me to give it to you if he didn't come, but I forgot.

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:03.891
He said he'd get it himself when he came over.

00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:06.031
It's still just sitting up there.

00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:12.331
I'll take it down for you.

00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:22.041
(If something happens to me, Se Ri is behind it.)

00:31:26.481 --> 00:31:29.081
If something happens to me, Se Ri is behind it.

00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:39.961
(Paternity Test Result)

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:41.861
(Test Results)

00:31:44.061 --> 00:31:47.230
(A: Hwang Gi Chan, B: Hwang Ji Ho)

00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:51.041
(Are not biologically related)

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:36.751
(Queen's House)

00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:39.091
To really set them up,

00:32:39.251 --> 00:32:41.791
I need to get them alone together one more time.

00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:42.861
Stop...

00:32:43.421 --> 00:32:44.691
with the Cupid act.

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:47.391
It's because I like Jae In.

00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:53.101
Darkness is the side of time that makes us remember the light.

00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:57.741
This looks like Kim Do Hee's handwriting.

00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:00.511
You didn't know you were being fooled?

00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:03.781
Kang Jae In. Don't trust me too much.

00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:06.651
I knew it. You really are a piece of trash.

00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:10.420
I'll be throwing you in the trash, so just wait.

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.551
Bingo.
