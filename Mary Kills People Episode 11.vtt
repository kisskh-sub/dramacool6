00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.990
The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.360
My sister, who I know very well, has performed in North Korea.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.640
I heard they call "cheers, drink it all"

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.130
This is how "a mouthful of dryness" is said

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.430
We also

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.660
One gulp

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.820
Don't you want to drink?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.620
In short

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.020
When you do euthanasia

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.520
I really think it's handsome

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Very sexy

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.760
Do you want me to show you?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.920
Bring me the Bafron.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
I'll show you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.060
This one?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.860
Did you bring the stuff?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.690
Where is Representative Gu Kwang-chul?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.220
Today is your death anniversary

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.420
Hey, hit harder.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.240
That's it

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360
Yu Suzhen

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.820
Hello

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.730
There's an antidote in the bag.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.590
Is this here? Wait...wait a minute.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.720
Where exactly

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.860
Hey this

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.410
Hello

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.820
Is this your plan?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.720
Hello, hello, wait, wait

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.460
What? An electronic anklet?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.990
You are such a despicable guy.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.920
Ouch

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.720
This is fulfilling your wish

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.720
Mr. Park Min-seong

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.390
You are hereby arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of Ms. Pei Meiying.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.390
You can exercise your right to remain silent

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.870
You can also hire a lawyer

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.190
You've been fooled.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.220
What's this

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.720
Don't move

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.130
arrest

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.940
Wake Up, Yu Suzhen

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.670

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.490
Please

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.040
Kill me

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.620
Are you serious?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.810
Just now

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.730
You said that I should kill you

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.420
Just like when your husband first met me

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.820
Just like when you ask me for help

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.370
I felt a mix of emotions

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.570
Even though I say I want to die

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.580
But I still hesitate

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.220
You from me

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.090
Do you feel hesitation in your heart?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.060
right

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.120
What kind of psychological changes have occurred?

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.270
In the ambulance on the way to the hospital

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.520
First responders

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.300
It's a miracle I didn't die

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.510
I said I survived because I hit a tree midway.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.620
Being alive is a blessing

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.160
them

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.420
To my blurred consciousness

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.020
Keep saying live

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.260
To live strong

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.260
Listen to what they say

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.930
I thought of my husband

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.990
The doctor said

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.230
She will come today

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.080
There's one thing I want you to do while you're still alive.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.120
Speak

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.930
What can I do for you?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.370
At once...

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.190
Look at the sunshine when the weather is good

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.160
Listen to the sound of rain when it rains

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.620
that's all

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.520
Feel more subtle things

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.690
I hope

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.920
you can

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.560
Come to me later

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.620
People don't live to do great things.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.260
you

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.620
that's all

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.570
Again...

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.210
Try to survive, okay?

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.020
This person

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.190
I really hope I survive.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.890
I have this idea

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.090
I

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.420
What to do now?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.520
With this thought in mind, I should live on.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.780
Even though my body has collapsed

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.190
I don't know how long it can last

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.900
but

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.720
I should live, right?

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.190
certainly

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.070
Your husband will cheer you on, too.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.560
Yena, where are you?

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.760
I have something urgent to ask you.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.260
Daxian and I saw the news.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.700
Is it true that Park Tae-hyung and his wife died?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.420
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.890
But now the situation is very bad

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.860
There are still people who want to harm Ms. Pei Meiying

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.620
I hope you can come and take care of me, Ye-na.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.720
OK, got it.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.120
Where should I go?

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.040
Yu Suzhen, you have nowhere to escape.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.710
Please give me some time

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.670
If you swear never to euthanize again

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.360
Words to help any patient

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.560
I will help you

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.620
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.650
Isn't that person already dead?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.460
My name was mixed up with other patients when I was admitted to the hospital.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.060
Now in the intensive care unit

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.560
If the news that Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive spreads

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.020
Someone might come and hurt her.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.920
Please protect her

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.590
Who to guard against

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.580
tell me

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.620
If the news that Bae Mi-young is still alive spreads

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.270
Gu Kwang-chul and Park Min-seong are worried that the witness is still alive

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.990
Will hurt her

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.820
I want to save Ms. Bae Mi-young

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.880
Please help me

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.830
First, Ms. Pei Meiying

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.560
Park Min-seong may come to the hospital

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.200
The problem is Gu Kwang-chul

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.980
To stop him from escaping

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.410
He must be captured at the Bafron transaction site

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.250
I have a way to make Gu Kwang-chul believe me

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.860
Hand over Bafron

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.260
This is the video footage of the client personally agreeing to euthanasia.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.390
If I offer to hand over this

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.200
Gu Guangzhe should believe that I want to cooperate with him

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.030
Is this video about you or Choi Dae-hyun?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.050
Only the client's screen

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.460
That's enough

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.900
I need medicine

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.790
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.780
I'm going there now

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.290
Where is Pei Meiying now?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.170
Wait a minute

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.130
See me first, then we'll talk about dealing with Pei Meiying.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.120
Where should I go?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.760
Nurse

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.060
What brings you to the hospital at this time?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.930
sorry

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.990
Dr. Yu has something to ask of me

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.660
I probably can't do it alone.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.700
Please help me

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.190
Doctor Yu?

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.730
right

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.710
Brother Zhixun

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.090
What? Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.080
Yeah, but

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.890
Park Min-seong or someone else will come and kill Ms. Bae Mi-young

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.890
You must protect Ms. Pei Meiying

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.690
Arrest that guy

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.160
Me? Me?

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.340
Am I the only one?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:08.930
Um

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.360
Yu Suzhen has arrived

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.270
You can handle it yourself, aunt.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.260
She's dying anyway.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.740
You can always handle this yourself, right?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.240
Hang up

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.770
It's cold outside

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.920
Cognac

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.520
Previously, in order to prove that the client agreed to euthanasia

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.950
I've been shooting videos

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.550
Safety first?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.070
Very Yu Suzhen's style

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.130
Let me take a look

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.790
I am Choi Kang-yoon

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.290
End your life now

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.300
This is all my choice

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.030
Now this moment

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.050
I feel very happy and satisfied

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.890
But this could be your insurance.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.390
On the contrary, it may become evidence of your crime

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.320
Maybe

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.400
All undisclosed euthanasia will be exposed

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.590
I don't know if this will hold up in court.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.320
But the patients' families

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.400
I hope to understand the true heart of the deceased

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.270
Of course it's best not to use this

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.230
Such an important thing

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.920
Do you want to give it to me?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.030
This means trusting you

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.860
From now on, these videos are yours to keep

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.750
But why do you

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.830
Suddenly changed your mind?

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.140
The situation is out of control

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.880
Becomes very dangerous

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.780
If Pei Meiying wakes up soon

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.850
If you confess the truth to the police

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.780
How big will things get in the end?

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.080
There's no way to predict

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.150
A lot has happened during this period of time

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.710
I'm so tired

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.000
So I need a partner to work with me

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.370
Where is Choi Dae-hyun?

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.490
He has surrendered to the police.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.910
So I felt uneasy and couldn't continue working with him.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.650
I need someone to help me get the medicine.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.210
And protect me from the police

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.350
what you say

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.920
From my perspective, I welcome it.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.190
Very good but

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.600
How strange! I'm a little overwhelmed.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.600
Although I don't want to face the reality

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.470
But I think you can protect me.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.200
Of course I don't

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.980
Brother, I can protect you.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.350
The choice is yours

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.470
I don't intend to force you.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.780
Yu Suzhen

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.680
finally

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.100
You are welcome to surrender to your brother.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.000
Welcome to my world

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.310
Yu Suzhen

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:24.810
Hello

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.570
I have the antidote in my bag.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.090
Are you...are you here? Wait for me.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.930
Where

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.330
Where exactly

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.250
Is this it?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.220
Hey, is this your plan?

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.280
So cute. So cute.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.880
I really want to bite the back of your neck and chew it over and over again

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.080
Hello

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.160
You can't treat me like this

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.790
I promised to protect you.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.790
Yu Suzhen

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.640
Yu Suzhen, get up

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.140
Yu Suzhen

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.910
Wake up, Yu Suzhen

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.920
Yu Suzhen

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.600
Are you okay?

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.430
Yu Suzhen

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.150
Wake up!

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.320
-= Basin City Police Department Wide Area Search Team =-

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.940
The serial numbers have been compared

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.090
We have confirmed

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.180
This is the Barfron extracted from the evidence storage.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.770
What's this

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.980
Hey, isn't this how we package evidence?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.330
There is also evidence number on it

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.500
-=Certificate No. 3=-

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.260
Do you have evidence that I was the one who took the evidence?

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.170
And then it flows to the outside world?

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.500
Deliberately covering up surveillance work

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.190
After this the drugs disappeared

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.750
It must be a coincidence.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.420
It's not that time point.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.720
It was only at that time that I discovered it was missing.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.340
Come in

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.230
yes

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:51.940
You know him, right?

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.660
No, I don't know him.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.840
He has confessed that the drugs he took were traded with you.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.630
It's over

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.800
Now tell me about it

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.220
Under whose instructions was this done?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.340
Brats

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.810
How dare you come in like this?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.870
From Gu Kwang-chul's office

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.390
I found all the money I received from you during this period.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.550
Already got the evidence

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.490
-=Arrest Warrant=-

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.090
-=Bansong Police Department Wide Area Investigation Team Captain An Taicheng=-

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.480
An Taicheng

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.530
Various luxury goods and car transactions

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.940
and a golf club

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.830
Finally found it

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.320
Gu Guangzhe and our Captain An

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.450
link

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.560
Just to show my identity.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.560
The younger generations worked so hard to catch the criminals.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.630
But the captain is accumulating connections, right?

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.420
I didn't know that Gu Kwang-chul was involved in the crime.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.340
Stop talking

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.440
The drug squad leader has confessed.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.910
I made a deal with Gu Guangzhe based on your instructions.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.720
If you want to quibble, you can tell me when you are investigated.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.020
I refuse to state

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.620
I'm speechless.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.130
Mr. Park Min-seong

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.580
I personally arrested you as a criminal.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.800
He was also the lawyer of Chen Yingxiu, who was killed by Gu Guangzhe with Bafulong.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.420
Do you think denial can solve the problem?

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.500
I refuse to state

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.590
Let's talk it out in court.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.380
Auntie, are you okay?

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.280
Why are the police guarding the ward door?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.870
Didn't you suddenly faint while working?

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.170
I said that on purpose because I was afraid you would be scared

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.110
Actually, I have a problem.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.630
After I finish treatment

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.600
May need to be investigated

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.060
What happened

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.010
There is a way to die called euthanasia

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.950
I believe that patients in pain need euthanasia.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.840
So I've been doing this kind of thing.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.760
And something happened during this process

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.780
Is it serious?

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.100
If I accept the investigation, I will probably be detained.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.440
But that's my choice

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.580
Even if I have to accept punishment, I have no choice but to accept it.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.470
But I'm worried about you and Cai Yun

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.050
Because of my belief

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.150
You might get judged by people.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.870
You may also need care.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.750
I will ask Father Yang for help

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.300
But you'll probably still be tired.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.360
sorry

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.780
I always have a lot of secrets

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.960
And I don't explain it to you guys.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.280
Do you have a lot of dissatisfaction?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.350
This is the secret I can't tell you.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.600
If you think that's the treatment the patient needs

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.500
I can understand

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.860
Because you are a good doctor

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.000
No matter what others say to you

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.360
I firmly believe you have no bad intentions in doing this.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.250
Thank you

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.480
How much is this?

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.060
I watched other tapes

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.950
These are all shot

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:30.680
To prove that the client chose euthanasia of his own choice

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.440
I am Choi Kang-yoon

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.920
Plan to end one's life

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.410
Those videotapes are in Gu Kwang-chul's house

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.080
This means all cases during this period

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.500
All led by Gu Guangzhe

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.850
From the perspectives of Yu Suzhen and Choi Daxian

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.240
It's evidence of the crime

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.440
Although it may become evidence of the crime

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.330
But it is proved that the client did it voluntarily.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.220
So it can also be seen as evidence of the legitimacy of euthanasia.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.660
During the trial, it can also be a factor in reducing the sentence.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.120
It's supposed to be a threat.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.110
Gu Guangzhe wants to kill Yu Suzhen with Bafulong

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.960
And pointed a gun at her.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.120
If you had gone to rescue Yu Suzhen later

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.640
She almost died.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.110
Hey Daojun

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.300
Call the hospital to check if Yu Suzhen has recovered.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.440
If possible, review it.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:16.940
good

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.650
I saw a video of Congressman Bai's son.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.220
When the investigation is almost done

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.950
Give it to Councillor Bai

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.660
Councilman Baek didn't even know that Gu Kwang-chul killed his own son

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.170
And help him cover the bottom

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.660
yes

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.750
It's his fault for protecting Gu Guangzhe.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.600
yes

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.470
But from what Councillor Bai has entrusted us to do

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.090
He probably doesn't know anything.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.550
After he knew the truth

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.340
That impact...

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.550
Team leader, it's time to interrogate Choi Dae-hyun.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.550
I went

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.050
Since Jin Shijian's death

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.140
Gu Guangzhe led the euthanasia

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.070
You and Yu Suzhen were threatened by Gu Guangzhe

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.040
Euthanasia was performed, is that what you mean?

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.680
No, it was the drug dealer Gu Guangzhe who asked me to do it alone.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.910
no

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.040
Not all of this

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.060
Did you do all this alone?

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.910
I owed a debt to Gu Kwang-chul when I was taking drugs

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.400
I was forced by him.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.170
Euthanasia for patients

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.710
Here is the evidence that I did these things alone

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.690
The client's video in your hand

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.740
No one else appears except the client.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.700
But in this recording

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.400
There is my voice and the voices of those present

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.400
And the original situation at that time

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.570
You can find out by confirming it.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.420
Yu Suzhen has nothing to do with this matter

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.400
no

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.150
This is not a video, it's a recording.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.510
Before euthanasia

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.410
Always ask the client to film a video with their consent

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.090
Is that right?

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.990
Yes, the client on that day, Chen Yingxiu, did not agree.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.610
I secretly recorded it myself

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.410
My tongue is no longer working.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.290
Everything I eat tastes bitter

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.040
Have you said goodbye to your family?

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.160
Around this time

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.590
Wife and mother

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.160
They should be arguing

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.810
Arguing over who took more of the inheritance

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.340
Yu Suzhen

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.740
Just asking me to surrender myself.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.640
If she is guilty

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.710
Just didn't report me.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.190
Choi Dae-hyun

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.940
You have helped Gu Kwang-chul too many times.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.660
It is hard to see it as being threatened and forced to assist

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.790
Gu Kwang-chul has a gun

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.460
Probably an illegal gun

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.160
He once joked about shooting me

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.390
So I couldn't refuse his request.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.160
no

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.510
If you admit that you did all this

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.840
The sentence could increase significantly

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.440
Please think rationally.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.510
Take a break

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.690
Yeah, take a break.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.060
Pan Zhixun, please help me

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.010
I will take all responsibility

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.860
Yu Suzhen will not agree

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.710
Yes, she definitely will.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.840
But from a realistic perspective

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.960
Suzhen has nephews and nieces to take care of

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.040
I've already taken drugs.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.190
It's hard to evade responsibility

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.110
Please let me take responsibility.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.390
Since the day I met Gu Kwang-chul at the abandoned factory

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.260
I've already made this plan.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.510
Please

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.110
Before going to the agency for investigation

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.740
Yu Suzhen, there is something you need to know

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.690
You say it

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.590
I'm ready

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.110
Choi Dae-hyun

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.290
Honestly, I did all this by myself.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.060
no

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.190
The incident has become so big

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.160
Can't let him be responsible alone

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.760
He has already planned to use Chen Yingxiu's case

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.590
Even brought evidence that he worked alone

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.310
When I'm interviewed tomorrow

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.990
I will confess everything to make things right.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.960
Park Min-seong died in prison today

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.760
It was said to be an accidental incident between prisoners.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.590
We can't help but doubt

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.560
No matter what you think

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.760
There must be someone we missed.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.210
In this case, if you, Yu Suzhen, were also detained,

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.610
Too dangerous

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.660
For children too

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.310
Even so, I cannot shirk my responsibility.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.610
Wait until it's really safe

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.190
Confess and take responsibility.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.540
Instead of now

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.310
Just think of it as assisting the investigation.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.260
This is a choice for everyone.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.910
You have a great friend

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.260
Choi Dae-hyun even brought evidence

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.810
Prove that you did all this yourself

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.810
Yu Suzhen, you are protecting Bae Mi-young

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.490
Contacted us, Detective Pan, for help

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.860
It also helped us arrest Gu Kwang-chul.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.010
I admit

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:22.510
But you are still a suspect under great suspicion

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.610
I don't want to shirk responsibility

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.160
You know there's no evidence.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.110
That's why it's so strong.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.660
good

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.740
The investigation should be

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.660
Koo Kwang-chul, Ahn Tae-sung, Choi Dae-hyun

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.940
These three people are the main culprits to close the case.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.690
But be careful

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.440
We will continue to follow you in the future

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.540
You come to finish it.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.560
That's right

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.560
You've worked hard

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.410
Now regarding the Bafulong murder case that occurred in Basin City

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.410
Interim investigation report on a strong suspect

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.210
We have realized that the use of Pavlon

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.510
The severity of the new type of homicide

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.160
Search with full force from the start

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.640
As we investigate the smuggling of Bafron

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.140
Receive high remuneration

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:49.010
Suspect A, who committed murder under the guise of euthanasia, was on his way

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.560
After receiving a report from the scene, we rushed to a place in Jiangnan.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.340
The police announced that they would receive a high price

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.060
Hand over the inside information to the deceased A

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.440
-='Received payment for providing search intelligence' Senior police officer arrested=-

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.510
Suspected of selling poison kept by the police as evidence

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.700
Senior police official An

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.560
-=Confirmed suspicion of poison leak, difficult to evade investigation=-

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.060
and Jin, the leader of the poison investigation team

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.860
Also arrested

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.890
What are you doing

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.060
I'm watching the sunlight coming in

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.890
Even in winter

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.010
The sun is warm too.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.590
Thank you so much

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.610
Thanks to you, doctor, for stopping me at that time.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.190
Today I can enjoy such beautiful sunshine

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.610
You made the right choice

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.290
Dr. Yu

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.790
Now in my life

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.890
The most painful and difficult time

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.310
But my will to live is the strongest

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.260
Very strange, right?

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.960
No

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:28.860
If you have this thought, then you should live.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.360
Although the subsequent treatment will be painful

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.990
I really want to live

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.040
don’t worry

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.040
All medical staff will do their best.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.940
Every day of life

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.810
They are all like gifts given to me by my husband

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.870
The social worker contacted me today.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.920
According to regulations

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.940
We have to send Xiaosong to the nursery.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.290
Yes

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.290
Gu Guangzhe

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.590
That devilish man is dead.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.840
So is it all over now?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.470
still

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.690
Today I met the person who chose to jump off the building

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.840
She's been longing for death all her life.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.390
But in this most painful and difficult moment

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.590
She regained the desire to live.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.270
The will to live

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.920
Maybe at some moment

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.070
Appear suddenly in some way

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.770
Do you regret what you have done so far?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.070
Have the will to live

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.370
Although it is a very grateful and happy thing

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.920
I'm so confused

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.690
Did I do something wrong before?

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.790
This

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.990
You must think that for patients in pain

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.420
Death will be a rest

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.120
But no one knows the correct answer

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.420
But isn't there a saying like this?

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.270
Just like when humans are born

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.890
Just like trying my best to come out of my mother's belly

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.640
Even in the face of death, I will fight to the end

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.240
Yes

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.770
Which death is the right choice?

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.020
Should this be a matter of choice?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.590
No one knows

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.390
We can only ask questions

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.470
Ask yourself again

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.170
This is what I think about Komatsu's situation.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.140
Dr. Yu

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:41.470
I hope you give up the idea that you must make Xiaosong happy.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.090
Don't feel that you have to be responsible for her.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.420
There is unexpected warmth in this world

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.070
And Xiaosong is also a smart child

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.770
No matter what the environment

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.670
They will grow up healthily

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.640
certainly

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.070
We have to keep watching her and cheer for her.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.620
The idea that I am responsible for everything

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.590
Is that too arrogant?

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.970
No

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.290
Worry about someone

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.620
The desire to care for others

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.220
We call it love

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.340
Maybe you think you're a cold person.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.820
But I don't think so

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.970
You are warm and loving.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.220
Yes

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.970
I resigned from the hospital today.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.920
Please let me work in your hospital, Father.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.520
Even if I can't be forgiven

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.290
Please let me work here

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.170
Komatsu

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.470
You have to live here from now on.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.270
This is what the social worker asked for.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.230
I'll be at the priest's hospital next door.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.920
I go there to work every day

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.210
so

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.180
We can meet anytime

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.560
I will come to visit you often with my brothers and sisters.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.070
good

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.200
No

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.630
I will come to see you every day

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.320
This is the last video your son left.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.040
I think you should take a look

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.820
I am Baek Hyun-seung

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.840
It's time to end my life.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.440
This whole process is my own choice

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.430
Now this moment

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.860
I feel very happy and satisfied

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.610
Can you say a little more?

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.580
If this video is made public

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.480
My family will probably see it too.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.370
I want to tell my family

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.910
No matter how hard I try

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.020
It will all end like this in the end

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.790
So forget clinical trials

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.200
Other treatments

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.820
Maybe I should forget what the doctor told me about the last year.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.190
dad

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.490
I know it's hard for you to accept

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.220
But this is really my own choice

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.160
You've done enough for me so far.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.320
- Sorry, both of you.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.190
I know they tried their best for me.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.840
-I'm sorry you died alone. -I don't regret it.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.390
So please accept this.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.010
Please remember this

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.620
I really love you guys

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.710
Cai Yan

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.730
I heard the deadline for reporting campus violence has passed.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.550
Even reporting myself cannot be canceled

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.230
What on earth are you thinking?

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.890
Victims of school violence cannot be allowed to

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.490
Stay in the same room with the perpetrator

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.990
You arranged this occasion to give Youmei a chance to explain, right?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.550
You two had a good relationship.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.000
Let's make peace

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.720
This is good for both of you.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.900
Youmei seems to be taking strange medicine

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.040
Are you trying to spread some beautiful and strange rumors again?

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.490
I say this out of genuine concern.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.920
This is the medicine Youmei is taking.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.180
She told her friends that this was Conarubi, a concentrate-enhancing drug.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.100
But this isn't the medicine.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.650
Don't come here anymore.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.000
It's not a good place

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.060
I feel ashamed of the uniform.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.520
I wanted to come

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.050
I like you

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.540
How do I confess my love during a prison visit?

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.050
Really

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.100
How are you doing?

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.970
Well, I work at Dr. Yu and Father Yang's hospital.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.500
Now a funeral director

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.040
Although the salary is at the level of part-time students

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.410
But I feel like I've never been so happy at work.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:08.380
You look happy

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.160
Um

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.410
Why did you reject Dr. Yu's request for a visit?

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.200
She is worried about you

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.570
Suzhen has a strong sense of responsibility

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.410
If I accept it once, I will come to work here directly

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.600
That's not right.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.650
The hospital, my nephew, and Xiaosong.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.010
I don't want to be someone Suzhen needs to take care of.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.860
Suzhen should live her own life

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.170
So I brought you the letter from Dr. Yu.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.830
I heard you even returned the letter.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.350
Don't do this again in the future

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.150
I really can't win, Yu Suzhen

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.510
I'll have someone pass it on to you. You must read it.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.600
good

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.880
What are you doing

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.620
Where is my medicine?

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.390
Where are my diet pills?

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.180
That's not a diet pill.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.400
That's a new drug.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.680
Drugs?

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.540
I asked a detective I know.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.220
Said it was a drug that was recently circulating among students

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.430
They say it's a drug to improve concentration or lose weight.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:37.540
You'll never eat it again.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:41.570
How can you throw it away

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.100
I can't get in touch with the guy who sold this. I'm going crazy.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.890
How can you throw it away

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.180
Who is

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.530
Who sold you this medicine?

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.450
Are you losing weight?

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.390
Can't you hear me?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.380
Are you losing weight?

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.150
What a happy thing it is to eat

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.210
Someone once said

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.570
People who like to eat

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.210
Be happy at least three times a day

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.320
How painful it must be for you to endure such a happy thing

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.470
I'm busy. I'm leaving now.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.730
Wait a moment

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.740
Here, this is a diet pill.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.430
It's a gift

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.870
Even if you eat everything you want

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:43.910
You will lose weight after eating it. Believe me.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.300
come on

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.260
People in the community

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.930
I'll go look for it.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.940
beautiful

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.060
Go study abroad

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.220
Anyway, because of school violence

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.570
It's also difficult for you to take the entrance exam

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:05.010
Go ahead

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:10.100
You can't do this

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.030
Sober and graceful

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:14.130
Okay

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.340
The luggage has been sent.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.260
My husband will bring the kids to the airport.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.240
I won't be back to Korea for a while.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.720
Help me sell the house.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.910
After selling it, just deposit the money into my account.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.680
Wait a minute, Auntie

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.270
Wait a minute, Auntie

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.590
Wait a moment

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.240
So cute

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.150
The little one knows what is good.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:24.400
Great Sage

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.800
I also went to Pei Meiying's ward today

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.450
Pei Meiying's most painful period in her life

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.250
The happiest smile

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:39.930
Great Sage

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.490
Desperate moments in life

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.870
At a moment no one expected

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.020
That person seems to have the will to live

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.620
Want to commit suicide

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.130
The moment I completely understood it all

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.840
I will continue to live for unexpected reasons

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.350
This is human

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.460
It's a miracle

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.010
Is that why life is so beautiful?

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.320
No other curious questions?

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:38.420
You must be very busy

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:40.430
Don't bother me anymore

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:47.300
-=3 years later=-

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.170
It's cold here. Is that okay?

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.130
Even if you stay still

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.460
You may also feel suffocated due to shortness of breath

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.040
in

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:05.920
Too boring

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.370
-=Gu Guangzhe=-

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:10.400
My release from prison coincided with my return to China.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.780
Fate

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.290
I have something to show you.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:20.370
The day Representative Gu died

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.810
It was the one the police failed to find in front of the building.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.160
One of our cars

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.620
This is the black box video of that car

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.910
In the bag that Yu Suzhen was holding

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:42.710
There are videos of people who requested euthanasia, right?

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:43.990
Yes

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.640
The police said this was my brother's crime.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.540
The main evidence is however

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.190
If this isn't my brother's stuff,

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.260
-=Gu Guangzhe=-

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.790
It's quite unfair.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.310
this

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.150
Follow the instructions of the representative

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.680
This photo was used to threaten Yu Suzhen before.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.310
But the original disappeared

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.990
It seems these people deceived my brother

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.730
I messed around

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.870
As we expected

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:27.660
Went abroad 3 years ago

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.560
Gu Guangzhe and his family returned to China

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.510
Sister Gu Hye-lin

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.280
She returned to China with her husband Kim Myung-seok and children.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.710
The two disposed of all their property three years ago

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.910
Leaving like a fugitive

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.670
It can be speculated

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.430
They must have been with

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.430
The Bafron murder case is related

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.780
Yes, Gu Huilin has always been a full-time housewife

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:49.750
But Jin Mingshi actually

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.270
I did business with Gu Kwang-chul.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:53.200
Yes, that's right.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.730
Jin Mingshi is suspected of moving abroad

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.090
Continue to circulate drugs in the country

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.600
Once you return to China, send your children to domestic schools.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.420
It seems that he plans to settle down in Korea again.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.060
Looks like we're starting a business.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.430
So this time the special investigation team was re-established

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.250
As far as I know, Captain An obstructed the investigation.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.630
Even arrests were difficult.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.350
This time, as the captain, I

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:21.580
We promise to fully support you

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.550
So you

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.310
To secure evidence of the two's crimes and arrest them

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.860
Be sure to find the

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.120
The Bafron murder case 3 years ago

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.470
Including

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:31.860
The last piece of the puzzle

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.760
-Yes -Yes

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:52.560
doctor

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:00.560
Thanks a lot

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:02.520
Thanks

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.390
Ah, this is tofu biscuit

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.450
I will never come to this kind of place again after eating tofu

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.520
This is tofu too.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:11.790
Eat quickly

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.370
Oh, thank you.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.820
Ah, Dr. Yu, because there are many patients in the hospital

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.880
So I couldn't come

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.510
Let's go too.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.330
The doctor is waiting for you

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:26.780
good

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.820
The elderly person living alone died

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.210
A patient with a short lifespan

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.590
But it looks peaceful.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.750
A patient with a short lifespan?

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:41.610
yes

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.220
Check the surrounding surveillance.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.190
Yes

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.370

-=Dean Yu Suzhen=-

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.220
haven't seen you for a long time

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.540
Do you work here?

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:01.420
We greeted each other for the first time today

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:05.630
Ah, right?

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.260
We just met once.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.550
Because other people talk about you

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.080
I thought we knew each other well.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:18.720
Hello

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.080
My name is Gu Huilin

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.030
I am Yu Suzhen

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.070
How did you get here?

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.430
I'm here to donate

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.590
There are people I want to see

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.820
Gu Guangzhe

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:46.150
You know my brother, right?

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:54.010
You clearly did the euthanasia business together.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.370
You pretend not to know me

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.420
Euthanasia

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.670
I don't know what you're talking about

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:07.560
That day

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.030
You were targeting my brother from the beginning, right?

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:15.390
So I will bring

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.070
He left with a bag full of evidence, right?

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.300
You seem to have misunderstood me.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.890
That has nothing to do with me.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:26.510
My brother is dead.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:27.290
What are you going to take?

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.410
To compensate for the harm I suffered

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.090
Something I don't know at all

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.470
What compensation should be made?

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.890
You took something precious from me.

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:41.540
Just grant me one wish.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.880
What I did with my brother

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.010
Start doing this with me from now on.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.430
I don't do business

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.470
The hospital here alone keeps me busy enough.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.480
There's nothing we can do.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:43.890
Just look forward to it.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.260
Looking forward to what I will do in the future

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.870
goodbye

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:34.290
Mom, that's why I need to get treatment.

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:35.180
doctor

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.090
Sister Yingyu

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:39.030
Get me some bottles of Pavlon.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:40.760
Who did you conduct the experiment on?

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.750
Doctor, can't we just take the path I designate for our final destination?

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.510
Please help me

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.870
Auntie wants euthanasia

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:52.150
She's the same type as Lee Yoon Hee, right?

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.870
At least the last journey should be peaceful.

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:55.770
oops

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.910
There are definitely patients who need euthanasia.
