The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.840
As the current criminal in the Li Yunxi murder case,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.140
Arrested urgently

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.700
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.250
-=Episode 6=-

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.890
Wait a moment

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.730
I'll go too.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.000
Because I've been here with her.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.430
You didn't see anything, did you?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.270
I'll go to the police station with you.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.890
but

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.670
Please give us time to comfort and send off the souls of the deceased.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.020
Lord

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.760
Please give it to Lee Yoon Hee

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.280
Bringing eternal rest

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.490
Woo Chae-young

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.780
Why did you change your name?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.320
You clearly deny yourself

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.470
The murderer of his own mother

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.770
Because everyone thinks I'm a criminal.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.520
Just like you now

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.170
That's why you changed your name and moved.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.460
No matter how it starts

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.570
The man who tied your mother's hands

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.170
Isn't it you?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.750
My mother teaches children to draw in a nearby nursery school.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.560
I also had classes that morning.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.020
I think she's playing with the kids.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.920
Do you really believe it?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.350
You were 16 years old

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.510
My mother who tries to commit suicide whenever she has time, please ask you for this kind of thing.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.500
Don't you find it strange?

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.630
Maria

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.060
I can't find my mom

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.970
At that time, Dr. Yu

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.250
No, Chaeyoung wants to help her mother.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.380
Of course, due to her mother's request

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.230
She tied her mother's hands. That's the truth.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.840
But this is to stop my mother from committing suicide

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.450
Mom might turn on the gas or cut her wrist

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.820
Don't let her hurt herself.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.420
This has happened a few times before.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.950
Chaeyoung

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.750
Just trying my best to help my mother who is resisting suicidal impulses

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.520
Unfortunately

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.370
Didn't help

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.420
Mother

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.360
mom...

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.200
Entering the water

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.380
Look carefully

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.660
Hey, you have to follow too.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.680
Look over there too

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.720
but

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.920
This was a long time ago.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.450
And the case is closed.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.670
Why bring up the past again?

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.770
Yu Suzhen now

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.160
Arrested as a suspect at the scene of Lee Yoon-hee's murder

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.410
That alone is reason enough.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.910
I said

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.290
You seem to have misunderstood

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.550
Lee Yoon Hee died of illness

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.360
Dr. Yu

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.430
I'm going to prepare

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.950
In addition to Dr. Yu

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.510
I'm going to prepare for prayer and leave for a while

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.860
Always with me

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.840
So that's it

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.200
I understand, Father.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.740
Where is that woman Yu Suzhen now?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.360
I want to see that crazy woman.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.620
- It's under investigation. - What's there to investigate?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.380
Wasn't he arrested on the spot?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.130
Isn't that the end?

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.920
The priest with Yu Suzhen

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.350
They also claimed that Lee Yoon-hee died of illness.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.980
Holding on

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.940
Where is the syringe?

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.700
The money the woman swallowed

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.100
There should be evidence.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.880
It seems that no money was collected this time

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.730
Li Yunxi is a street vendor with a child

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.200
Is a life protection object

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.940
What are you doing?

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.330
Are you an angel?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.250
Killing has become her hobby.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.670
Investigate carefully

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.460
If I let her run away this time

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.960
You replace that woman.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.160
Die

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.270
Yes, I understand.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.440
Why are your steps so heavy?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.900
Is it strange that citizens are looking for police?

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.270
I guess I have something to complain to you about.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.580
Yu Suzhen

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.710
I heard you arrested her.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.890
He was arrested on the spot. No way.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.470
Hello

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.580
Hello

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.660
I'm not here to ask you how you caught her.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.520
I said Mr. Police

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.220
I said Mr. Police

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.680
Let her go

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.670
Besides you, there are many people who can transport goods.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.100
You're just one of the many

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.930
One of them, the brat

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.510
But Yu Suzhen is different

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.560
She's the only one. She's special.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.250
You don't understand what I mean, right?

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.460
Let her go

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.210
-= Basin City General Hospital =-

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.590
What's going on?

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.750
Why is it so severe?

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.520
What are you looking at?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.600
What's this

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.780
I told you.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.280
She can't live quietly.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.970
Scare me

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.390
We are from the Guangsou Team

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.280
Are you Choi Dae-hyun?

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.000
right

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.850
We are the police

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.420
Hello

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.920
Are you doing well?

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.800
Um

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.250
Talk to me

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.050
So

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.610
About your mother's death

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.590
You're not going to say anything more, are you?

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.020
good

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.860
Can you tell me about the case from two years ago?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.290
Basin City General Hospital Case

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.590
Kwon Kyung-mi

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.780
I looked at the police records.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.050
Discovered the doctor who last treated her daughter before she died

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.180
It's you

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.990
And by chance her daughter

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.230
Death by assisted suicide

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.100
Is that the cause?

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.770
It seems that you think the things that happened around me

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.620
I did it all

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.960
I'll ask you again

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.560
Kwon Kyung-mi incident

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.560
Is this also your masterpiece?

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.000
You want to exercise your right to remain silent, right?

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.540
good

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.770
Anyway, the autopsy is in progress.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.790
Father Choi Dae-hyun, head nurse, and Kwon Kyung-mi

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.360
We have already secured those who can testify.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.770
I look at these people.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.640
It's not like they're going to die.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.820
But they are more nervous than you now

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.110
If everything goes well, things will end faster than expected.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.500
I thought about it carefully

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.840
Since the Beijing-US incident two years ago

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.070
It was around that time that Dr. Yu started

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.580
A big change has taken place

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.370
She used to be a more cheerful and positive person.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.360
I asked Dr. Yu to kill my daughter before.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.260
I don't know Yu Suzhen

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.960
Choi Dae-hyun does know

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.910
What is your relationship with Choi Dae-hyun?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.560
He was a VIP guest at the entertainment club where I used to work.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.780
My friend probably dated Daxian at that time.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.730
But she died two years ago.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.240
I heard she was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.170
Even the hospital gave up on her.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.630
In the end, it was Daxian who took care of her.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.280
I am very grateful to him

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.800
My friend has no family

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.220
But my ex-boyfriend Daxian also helped with the funeral.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.720
My ex-girlfriend Mina

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.130
Her death has nothing to do with me.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.330
She had been diagnosed with a terminal illness at that time.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.930
As far as I know, the cause of death was multiple organ failure.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.820
Two years ago

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.590
What happened between her and Yu Suzhen

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.280
-=2 years ago=-

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.670
Hey

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:24.690
You are here

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.750
What? Are we having barbecue today?

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.790
-Hello, uncle. -Hello.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.860
Hello, Jae-yeon and Jae-yoon

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.090
Hug you Hug you

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.300
Uncle, why do you always come to my house for dinner?

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:41.600
Kim Jae-yoon

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.980
Did you really become a beggar after being fired from the hospital?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.570
I won't become a beggar

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.000
But it's almost there

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.220
Hey, you can't talk to adults like that.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.230
The only person who loves me is Jae-yeon

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.500
Caiyan, do you need me to help you with math?

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.180
I plan to apply to an arts high school.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.490
Yes, Jaeyeon plays the piano very well.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.070
I studied fine arts

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.430
Yes, Jae-yeon studied art and is great at drawing.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.920
Come here, I have something to tell you.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.500
- What's wrong? - Come here.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.080
What's wrong

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.950
What do you want to do?

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.420
In front of the children

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.220
Why do you always touch me?

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.190
And kept pulling my clothes

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.950
I have a blood tester at home.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.370
- Let's check the blood. - Wait a minute.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.580
Is this why you always invite me to dinner?

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.340
Do you want me to skip the blood test and go straight to the police?

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.860
Don't feel responsible towards me.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.080
I was exposed to drugs and later even lost my medical license.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.250
None of this is your fault

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.110
So you don't have to feel sorry

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.880
You just need to reject my feelings when you went to college

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.370
It's enough to feel sorry for this matter.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.300
I feel uneasy

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.100
I know you have strong empathy.

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.300
But sometimes I get too emotional

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.000
I made a lot of mistakes unintentionally.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.060
You will regret it after you finish it

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.310
If you're so worried about me

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.500
Just take me with you to live

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.250
Promise me you'll tell me if you feel bad.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.700
Don't look for other ways

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.270
OK

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.220
Let's go back and eat.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.230
I'm about to start

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.400
Is it tasty
tasty

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.000
Hey, asshole

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.780
You agreed to pay the bill, but you went back on your word. How can this be okay?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.850
Really, I can drive there myself.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.510
oh

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.030
It was my first time driving a truck and it was quite fun.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.140
And you can't force your body recently

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.340
The area where the glass was removed may become inflamed.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.600
good

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.200
Anyway, I have to fix it quickly.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.590
Where's the swing in your yard?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.080
But the accessories are hard to find.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.860
Jae Yoon must have waited a long time.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.100
If it can be repaired, that's the best. If it can't be repaired, there's nothing I can do.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.550
Although I can't swing now

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.760
But he would hang on to the pillar or climb up

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.830
It was fun.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.700
Don't worry

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.860
27 years old female

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.360
Hospitalization for pancreatic cancer

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.560
I was discharged from the hospital yesterday morning but I'm back today.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.000
I left after receiving a one-week prescription for narcotic painkillers.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.670
But now it says it's almost finished and it's not working

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.450
Is there a surgical record?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.000
Because it was stage 4 cancer, I didn't have surgery.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.640
She agreed to chemotherapy and new medications.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.940
But the results are not good

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.470
Please wipe the blood off her mouth

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:07.910
good

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.220
Is there a wound in her mouth?

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.540
The bleeding was because she gritted her teeth to endure the pain.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.600
Patient, you need to open your mouth.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.040
When there is too much blood in the mouth, it will be difficult to breathe

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.860
Don't bite anything in your mouth. Spit it out.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.180
Prepare intravenous narcotic analgesics

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.750
Fentanyl [FebtanyI]: narcotic analgesic IV [Intravenous Injection]: intravenous injection

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.380
- Then find a ward as soon as possible. -Okay

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.450
don't want

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.190
We won't be hospitalized again.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.930
Neither my child nor I want to continue to be hospitalized

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.940
Doctor, just give us some painkillers.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.810
I took the medicine home

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.940
My child is dying and cannot be hospitalized again, doctor

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.850
A week's supply was used up in one day.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.210
You can't go home in this state.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.330
The doctor thinks they will be back soon.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.840
So the ward didn't give them a refund.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.130
I think I was against their discharge from the hospital from the beginning.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.670
The ward didn't give you a refund.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.360
Transfer to the ward immediately after taking the medicine

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.720
No, I can't stay here anymore.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.660
No, I don't want to stay here even if I die.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.060
I don't want to die

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.460
My child cannot be hospitalized. There is no way he can stay any longer.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.020
I can't go on. I can't go on.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.530
-Guardian, please calm down. -This cannot continue.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.900
-Guardian, please calm down. -This can't go on, Jiwon.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.340
-Ji-won can't live here anymore. -Guardian

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.020
-Give me the medicine. -Please calm down.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.850
-Give me the medicine. -Calm down. Calm down.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:28.740
Patient, please calm down.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.420
Patient's mother

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.300
Luckily she could still get some sleep.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.540
yes

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.040
doctor

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.770
Can you cure my child's illness?

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.170
Medical staff are doing their best

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.540
All the doctors said

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.600
My child won't survive more than three months.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.220
When the doctor judges that the patient cannot be saved

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.020
What else can we do for patients?

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.860
Treat pain

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.610
Endured all the pain in three months

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.960
And then die

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.590
Will my daughter's death become more meaningful?

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.260
The longer the time before death

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.200
Will it be more faithful to human dignity?

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.140
Other medical staff including Dr. Chen

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.350
Searching for effective pain management

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.100
It is said that medical technology has developed

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.050
But you're not using those technologies to save lives.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.430
But torturing people

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.400
There's no way to save her.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.470
But it made her suffer for a longer time.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.460
You are arrogant

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.880
sorry

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.510
Then please kill my child.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.300
What

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.340
If you can't save her

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.590
If you leave your child in pain,

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.940
Might as well kill her.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.640
A less painful method

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.210
I'm a doctor, that's impossible.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.250
Isn't a doctor someone who relieves the patient's pain?

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.210
If death is the only option left

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.730
Shouldn't this be done?

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.990
this this

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.380
Did you make this yourself?

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.610
Fortunately, it was installed

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.730
I really don't know how to thank you at a time like this

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.760
What are you thanking me for?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.950
Last time I said the swing couldn't be repaired

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.750
Cai Yun cried so sadly

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.360
I've been thinking about you

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.600
So I just made it.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.290
Cai Yun comes over

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.320
You swing it

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.060
I made it strong. When you grow up, you can swing it too.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.810
Uncle, didn't you receive outpatient treatment?

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.990
I planned to go there as soon as I got up today.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.050
But I have too many things to do. I plan to go later this afternoon.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.730
I'll disinfect it for you now.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.790
There is a household's sink drain leaking

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.370
Grandma lives alone

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.390
I have to go there.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.520
Then you must go to treatment today.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.480
good

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.030
I'm out of medicine at home. I'm planning to go today.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.090
If I miss today's treatment time

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.130
Come to the emergency room later.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.970
I'll help you check

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.320
OK, thanks

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.040
Have fun! Have fun!

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.120
-=National Customer Satisfaction Ranking: Basin City General Hospital Ranks First for 10 Consecutive Years=-

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.260
The patient's mother, A, a high school Chinese teacher

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.570
A daughter suffering from pancreatic cancer

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.460
After being diagnosed with a terminal illness, I became pessimistic about the people around me.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.060
Is there anyone famous coming to the hospital?

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.900
Dr. Yu, didn't you watch the news?

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.080
There's been a murder in our hospital.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:05.920
A murder case?

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.610
who

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.200
Do you remember the patient with pancreatic cancer?

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.040
The guardian killed her daughter.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.760
Showed an uncooperative attitude

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:17.910
The police's position is that under current law

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.170
Cannot be considered an accomplice to suicide

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.620
Increased penalties for vulgar murder

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.700
Mother

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.210
Please

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.040
I want to take a break

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:56.690
Help

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.060
I'm sorry to ask you for such a thing.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.270
Endure all the pain and then die

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.150
Would my daughter's death have meant more?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.150
Although medical technology has developed

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.550
But you don't use medical technology

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.150
Save the person

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.870
But torturing them

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.050
You obviously can't save her.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.220
But she experienced longer pain

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.100
you

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.220
Too arrogant

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.600
What are you doing

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.920
I told you to go work together.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.370
Ouch, forget it.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.820
Just doing this job is enough for me to eat and drink.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.350
What is enough

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.650
Do you think eating, drinking and living are simple things?

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.520
I'm in debt because of paying for my wife's medical expenses.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.320
Where do you get the courage?

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.000
I injured my leg today.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.070
I have to go to the hospital to get medicine.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.450
Don't say anything

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.100
Come with me from today.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.200
I'll go out to get the medicine during lunch break tomorrow.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.900
You didn't even get paid to help with some minor repairs.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.820
It's not charity.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.720
Go to the construction site and work for a few months

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.770
Save some money

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.020
I can rent a shop somewhere else.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.700
real

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.600
Is that the amount I'll be paid if I work for three months?

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.840
-= Basin City General Hospital =-

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.600
Here comes the burn patient

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.750
- Burns patient. - Please move to beds 3 and 4.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.250
No. 3 in front, No. 4 in the back

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.370
hurry up

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.520
A burn patient

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.050
doctor

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.920
When they were welding the container

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.670
The spark ignited the fire

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.770
They were locked up and badly burned.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.770
Our hospital cannot admit two burn patients.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.170
We were planning to send them separately.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.970
But Dr. Yu, you handled it very well last time

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.520
Saved all the patients.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.900

Parkland Fluid Replenishment: A Specialized Infusion Method for Burn Victims

Cold saline: physiological sodium chloride solution

yes

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.600
Central venous catheter ready

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.100
Now for the infusion

November 9, 2022

7:44 PM

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.420
Patient died

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.520
lady...

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.070
lady...

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.450
It hurts so much

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.400
It hurts so much

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.270
It hurts so much...

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.920
Have fun

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.100
Get excited

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.100
Is he an uncle?

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.400
Please kill me

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.200
Please kill me

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.900
You can survive if you stay calm.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.070
it hurts

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.770
It hurts so much

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.130
Get the morphine.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.130
Morphine: a toxic analgesic

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.520
Madam Madam

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.070
Ma'am, I'm in so much pain.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.950
Please kill me

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.350
You have to survive

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.700
Uncle, you are a very strong man.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.600
No

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.450
No, I want to die.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.150
You're in so much pain right now.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.070
I can't judge the situation properly.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.870
I will definitely save you

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.020
So just be patient for a while.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.170
If no one responds, just give up.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.920
What's going on?

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.720
Long time no see, brother.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.750
Yeah, long time no see.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.400
Nice to meet you

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.650
Don't be nervous

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.370
I'm not asking you to get back together.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.650
ah...

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.100
You make me so sad

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.150
But what can I do?

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.900
I haven't been able to consult recently.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.770
I look like this

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.370
Taking a break

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.720
That's even better.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.700
I know you were stripped of your medical license due to drug use.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.070
So illegal surgery is being performed here

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.070
The sisters in the store all know you

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.250
You're very capable and cheap.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.870
But is it alcohol poisoning this time?

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:24.870
Um

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.800
It seems you understand a lot.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.870
When I run out of money, the alcoholism will heal naturally.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.850
I'll contact you when I start seeing patients again.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.670
But I don't have time to wait

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.550
My Status

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.000
Worse than you

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.050
Where are you sick?

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.620
Anyway, I've fallen

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.900
The aunt who injected propofol is good

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.270
Surgery is not possible in the short term

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.950
No, I can't do it anymore.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.120
injection

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.500
This is enough

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.120
Please give me an injection to make me sleep.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.450
Let me sleep for a long time

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.700
Especially long ones

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.000
The treatment process is too painful

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.500
So the patients kept saying that they would rather die.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.070
But this person, after taking morphine

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.920
This has been happening since I became unconscious.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.400
He wants to die more than live.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.320
Is this patient

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.920
No family?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.100
He had no children.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.770
My wife died of cancer last year.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.020
Even if he survives, this situation is the most difficult to deal with.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.600
Even if I recover miraculously

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.000
There is almost no chance for him to return to his daily life

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.670
Chief Jin, what do you think?

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.820
Several years of treatment are required

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.650
To know the result

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920
Don't do this. You must save him.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.420
Don't say he has no family.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.350
Treatment costs are also a big issue.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.320
The company that hired him to work did not have a license

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.070
Forget compensation, I can't even pay for treatment.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.970
Then I'll put it on first.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.270
Dr. Yu, is this you?

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.300
Yes

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.820
I made an agreement with him that I would definitely save him.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.750
So if there are expenses to be dealt with

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.170
Please contact me

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.300
knew

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.370
- Chief Jin - Yes

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.270
Please do your best

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.320
Yes, I understand.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.120
And Dr. Yu

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.170
Don't come here anytime soon.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.970
If he sees you, he will definitely beg you to kill himself.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.670
If you get too excited, it will be bad for the patient himself.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:44.800
yes

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.170
But please give him all possible treatment

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.420
Please

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.450
Go back to your own home

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.200
How long will you be here?

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:09.670
I said no

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.720
If you continue like this

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.520
I'll report you to the police for trespassing.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.050
Then I

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.300
I'll report you to the drug squad.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.750
I don't take drugs anymore.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.450
Did you tell the police the same thing?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.250
No matter what you say

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.770
I can't agree to your request.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.920
I have a terminal illness

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.350
I won't live for more than a few months anyway.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.550
But this is also murder.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.350
So

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.070
Can you cure my illness?

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.200
Can you save me?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.070
How can I kill you?

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.700
I'm not asking you to kill me.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.970
I want you to help me

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.120
This is my wish

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.620
Please help me, brother.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.770
so

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.920
Under the persistent request, you have no choice

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.570
Did you help her?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.820
No, although I feel sorry for her.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.920
But I sent her back.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.170
And then it's gone

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.960
But why hasn't it been done yet?

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.340
It will be over soon

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.040
Will process the autopsy results and put an end to this matter perfectly

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.620
Get it done before tomorrow morning

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.420
There's news this morning

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.310
What you have to do is over.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.170
Okay, just go home and wait for a while.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.490
Please call me when the autopsy results come out.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.060
Don't try to make excuses

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.530
clear

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.820
Ouch, damn.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.850
Representative

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.650
I have confirmed it through the straw in the national science search.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.870
There shouldn't be any Bafron.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.790
OK, I'll contact you later.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.850
Although Councillor Bai may make us lose our jobs

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.170
But representative

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.350
It will really kill you and me

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.660
-=Fire hydrant=-
Do you think this makes sense?

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.110
No, it's under investigation. You can't just barge in.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.350
What kind of world is this?

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.550
Choi Dae-hyun

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.670
Not a lawyer. Wait a minute.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.030
-Where are you? -I told you not to do this.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.170
What is this doing? How is security work done?

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.270
sorry

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.110
Choi Dae-hyun has made an appointment with me to not see Yu Su-jeong for the time being.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.890
and cut off contact

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.170
Give me some more time

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.970
I can help Choi Dae-hyun secure evidence at the scene.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.270
You arrested him without a warrant.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.270
Investigating him without the consent of his lawyer?

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.110
This is obviously what you did wrong.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.150
Lawyer, you don't have to do this.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.180
Yu Suzhen

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.610
Arrested at the scene of the death

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.600
Already investigating

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.980
No, wait a minute.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.260
Was Suzhen arrested at the scene?

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.770
The person arrested at the scene was Yu Suzhen

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.950
Not Choi Dae-hyun

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.770
I want to take Choi Dae-hyun away

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.890
If you want to investigate, please come here with an arrest warrant.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.390
Who is the deceased?

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.490
You are curious, so stay and accept the investigation.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.710
Not only did you illegally detain and investigate, you also maliciously lured

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.060
We have no legal obligation to

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.060
To tell him what we investigated about others

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.770
but

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.920
Choi Dae-hyun is very curious

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.270
So I want to try my best to give some suggestions.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.260
- Get out of here now. - I'm under investigation.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.240
but

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.350
Please tell me who the deceased is.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.530
Choi Dae-hyun

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.050
Sooner or later, you'll be investigated.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.370
So I'm willing to take the survey.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.950
According to your statement, it may be detrimental to Yu Suzhen.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.690
It's not that assisting the investigation can help that woman.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.700
Go back today

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.270
I'll get to know the situation later

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.230
Make an appointment with the police for investigation

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.800
Talk to me later.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.040
Let's go

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.540
You'll know anyway

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.240
I'll tell you who the deceased is.

On the green hillside where dreams shine

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.380
A few goats

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.490
Eat grass and play

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.900
With a face as bright as the sun

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.980
The raindrops are falling

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.980
Will frown

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.530
Looking for Mommy

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.120
Looking for Daddy

Sad face

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.090
The sun is shining...

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.590
I'll take you to the nun.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.360
Are you waiting for your mother?

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.900
that...

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.390
Your mother...

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.270
Mom, it doesn't hurt now, right?

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.260
What

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.460
Mom is over there. It won't hurt, right?

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:09.940
Um

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.400
Mommy won't feel any pain now.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.590
Mother

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:52.000
Mom Mom

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.740
You should tell me immediately when the detective comes looking for you.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.110
Before the lawyer arrives

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.920
You should always exercise your right to remain silent.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.300
In this case

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.770
You will be useless to the police.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.490
Do you know how bad this is for you?

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.550
Can't I say now that I did it?

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.480
Your phone has been tracked by the police.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.400
They know you weren't anywhere near the scene.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.940
I can only give up proving that you are not a suspect of murder.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.710
Now that things have come to this, I can only focus on reducing your sentence.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:26.940
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.510
I'm going to turn myself in.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.440
I've said it before

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.400
This lie just won't work.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.270
Not a lie

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.850
The guardian came to the ward today to conduct an on-site appraisal.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.180
Come out

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.440
I heard that you were asked by your daughter.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.090
Is it true that the murder was carried out?

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.630
I heard your daughter's suicide note was found at home.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.250
Why didn't you submit in advance?

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.810
You became a murderer who killed your own child.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.960
Don't you regret it?

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.400
No regrets

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.300
Because the child is free from pain

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.450
I am already very content

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.450
Dr. Yu, you need to come quickly.

-=Intensive Care Unit=-

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.150
Did anything go wrong during treatment?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.710
No, everything is fine recently.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.170
I thought he could receive treatment stably now.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.920
Hurry up, Dr. Yu

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.650
-=Intensive Treatment Room=-
Make way. Make way.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.960
Uncle, what are you doing?

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.040
Husband...Mrs.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.220
Please let me out

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.900
Uncle

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.120
Release the doctor

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.730
Talk to me. Talk to me.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.270
I will listen to you.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.310
Uncle, you don't want anyone to get hurt, right?

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.010
lady

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.580
It doesn't matter if I die like this, so let me out

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.770
I understand your pain.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.870
But the risk of infection is very high if you go out now, so you can't

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.740
No need anymore

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.790
Please be patient and hold on a little longer...

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:46.790
I'll discharge you after the treatment is complete.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:51.870
When will the treatment end?

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.670
After I die?

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.450
I told you to kill me

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.410
Uncle

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.900
I've always asked you this.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.460
Let you kill me

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:10.570
I...I can't leave here until I die, right?

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.400
I know treatment is hard for you.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.590
But I really hope you survive.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.090
Cai Yun prays for you every night

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.000
I'm sure there are many neighbors praying for you.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.210
I will do my best

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.310
So please continue with your treatment...

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.330
Is breathing alive?

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:40.940
This look

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.460
Is just breathing the same as being alive?

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.700
I...

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.660
I can't shed any tears

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.120
All burned out

Thank you

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.410
but

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.790
here...

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.950
It feels like hell.

Uncle

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.250

-Uncle -After the patient died

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.250
Dr. Yu has been in mental pain

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.590
How could such a person be connected to the murder case of Kwon Kyung-mi?

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.500
Dr. Yu is doing his best to help patients more than anyone else.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.330
She was really heartbroken after losing her patient.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:00.920
She was helping my daughter.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.610
I have worked hard for a long time

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:05.710
Although it's useless

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:07.480
but

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.760
Dr. Yu, what are the suspicions?

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.570
Suspected of assisting patients in euthanasia

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:16.610
Under investigation

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.280
Is there any evidence?

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.970
It seems there is no evidence.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.110
The visit is over

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.230
It's a blessing

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.090
Hearing the man who killed my daughter

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.590
It's not what Dr. Yu said.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.520
You looked relieved.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.540
In the past, it was due to lack of evidence

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.520
So maybe it would be helpful if you defend her like this

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.960
But now it’s different

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.160
Lee Yoon-hee

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.560
Autopsy in progress

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.080
If the results come out

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.540
Even without the priest's statement

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.550
Can also find out Yu Suzhen's crime

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.220
Although I don't know what you are looking for

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.320
No matter what the autopsy results are

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.770
That would prove Yu Suzhen's suspicion.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.540
Direct evidence?

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.220
Direct evidence

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.280
When Lee Yoon-hee died

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.470
You said it was just you and Yu Suzhen at the scene

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.580
Yes

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.290
If it weren't for Yu Suzhen

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.380
Is it you who did this?

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:56.410
Please persuade Yu Suzhen

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.400
Help her, let her turn herself in.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.690
Now this is the best option to reduce the sentence

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:05.800
Dr. Yu did not kill Lee Yoon-hee

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.620
But what do you want me to convince her of?

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.550
Oops, it's too late.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.340
Let him go. He has to go.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.410
Gotta pray

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:14.600
Why are you doing this so late?

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:15.590
You can go now

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:19.230
So how is Dr. Yu?

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.080
Ah, the investigation is over.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.470
- You can go now. - No, I mean

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.370
Isn't it Dr. Yu?

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.550
If Dr. Yu can't get out

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.420
I'll always be here

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.530
priest

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.180
Do you think Yu Suzhen is because

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.600
Is he under suspicion because of Lee Yoon-hee's case?

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.840
What do you mean?

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.870
That means it's involved in other cases.

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:49.250
The autopsy results will be out soon.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.000
That's it, you can go.

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.070
If you want to know what happens next

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.280
Read the news News

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.260
It's gonna be lively next time

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:04.450
Go away

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.270
What if I did it?

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:14.730
Yes

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.020
I killed Lee Yoon Hee

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:21.480
I killed him.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.450
Enough

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.080
Even so, you can't help Yu Suzhen

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.300
Not me now

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.380
I'm confessing to my lawyer now.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.500
Although this is not the case

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.360
But I was the one who handled all the previous cases.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.640
Don't you know that too?
People like Yu Suzhen

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.350
How can I get Bafron?

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.740
She has never taken drugs.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.620
Bafron

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.190
Don't you know

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.620
Isn't this the kind of medicine you can get in the hospital?

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:00.160
Euthanasia

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.070
This started because of me.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.980
My ex-girlfriend

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.000
Mina

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:11.900
I killed him.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:01.260
It stinks. It stinks.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.900
The living dead are also human beings

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.420
How can it stink so badly, like a corpse?

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:19.730
Yeah, gift

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:32.380
Do I need a syringe?

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.520
Most people drink it in wine.

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.260
Intravenous injection is the most reliable

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.820
But in that case

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.910
It will leave marks on your body

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.220
Therefore, the various drugs and Pavlon that the patient had taken before

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.850
I'll also drink it with alcohol

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:16.150
In this state

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.090
I can't let her drink it herself.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:19.980
Use a respirator?

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:27.610
Wait a moment

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:49.910
Is he dead?

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:52.640
Wow

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.670
Like sleeping in

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.700
Are you really leaving like this?

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.890
So magical

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.860
Let's go

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.440
This is what you said

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.320
Those who cannot be treated

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.420
Is this the last gift for them?

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.560
Someone will come in

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.190
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:19.520
mom

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.600
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:17.240
You can go home now

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.280
Because someone appeared who claimed to have killed Lee Yoon-hee

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.340
Father Yang did not kill anyone

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.740
You think you're not guilty, right?

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.490
Give me that treatment, too.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:30.070
What are you saying? Of course I have to say no.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:33.460
Can I avoid that pain because I'm afraid of being blamed?

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:36.910
Someone reported that they would purchase goods tonight under the name of Jin Shijian.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.620
The situation is a bit strange right now.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.080
Drugs lost by police

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.670
This is also suspicious in Jin Shijian's hands.

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.400
Is there a ghost?
