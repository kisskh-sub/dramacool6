00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.959
Second Master, Miss Lian!

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.240
Bad news!

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.278
What is it?

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:14.758
Several chiefs said they will

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.358
stop supplying tea to the Lian family.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.479
This shipment was
meant for export overseas.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.558
It'll be impossible
to gather enough new tea

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:21.919
in such a short time.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.719
What are we going to do?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.558
Qi, weren't you in charge of this?

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.078
Wasn't the contract already signed?

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.838
How should I know?

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.239
Why would they break the deal?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.239
They said the merchants

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.679
from the Lian family
never showed up for the transaction.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.639
Yesterday,
someone offered a higher price,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.558
and the chiefs signed with him instead.

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:39.479
Did you find out who it was?

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.679
The one who signed the deal was me.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.600
Xinruo, stewards,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.000
no need to panic.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.159
I was once a part of the Lian family.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
If you need help,

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.079
I'll gladly offer the olive branch.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.400
Xinruo, as long as you agree,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.999
the Lian family can still be
part of the tea trade.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.979
(Contract Agreement)

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.860
(Signed by Jiang Yao)

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.999
You went through all this trouble

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.239
just to make me owe you a favor?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.560
Because of Pei Yujie's dealings,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.200
the Pei family's exports
have taken a hit.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.200
I can let the Lian family
join in the tea trade,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.640
but in return, the Pei family's goods

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.720
must also be sold overseas
through the Lian trade network.

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.079
What do you say?

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.079
I need some time to think about it.

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.959
Alright.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.719
But time is running out.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.120
Miss Xinruo,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.800
don't keep me waiting too long.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.700
(Pei Residence)

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.460
(Contract Agreement signed by Jiang Yao,
Co-signed by Lian Xinruo)

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.159
In the end, I won this round.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.479
Yao, won't doing this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.400
make Xinruo your enemy?

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.199
This is the only way.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.639
I want full control of the Pei family.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.439
Then little by little, I'll infiltrate
the Lian family's business.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.839
In the end, Xinruo will have
no choice but to return to me,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.959
to rely on me.

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.879
As for Pei Yuze...

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.959
He may not live
long enough to see that day.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.440
Yao, you're brilliant.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.959
Look. Those tea houses
Jiang Yao seized,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.080
though located in different cities,

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:54.479
are all clustered around Jiang City.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.479
Not bad.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.079
You're pretty sharp.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.118
When the people the Lian family
sent to sign the deals never came back,

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.479
I suspected someone
was meddling in the dark.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.159
It seems Pei Xueshan
is also involved in this.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.479
Not only that,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.040
Jiang Yao has started
targeting the Lian family's business.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.519
Doesn't that worry you?

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.078
Since he wants it,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.239
let him have it for now.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.278
Once we gather enough evidence,

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.318
we'll crush them all in one blow.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.199
You're ready to stand on your own.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.640
While Jiang Yao is
stirring up trouble in Hu City,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.159
we get to travel around a bit.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.318
Let him think
we're too weak to fight back,

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.839
so he'll drop his guard.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.920
One more thing.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.959
Just now, Wen Yuan brought someone in.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.920
Bring him here.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.560
Kneel!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.840
Who is this man?

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.239
He is the one

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.719
who killed Dr. Fang and Jin Se.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.800
Xinruo...

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.360
You're not worthy to die here.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.320
It would only taint
the Lian family's grounds.

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.679
Wen Yuan found him near the docks.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.999
He was likely preparing to flee Hu City.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.318
He admitted that Pei Xueshan

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.318
planned to use
the tea shipments as cover

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.679
to smuggle tungsten ore.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.480
Good.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.200
If that's the case,

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.639
then let's wait for the fish to bite.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.239
Master,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.159
there's a problem with the tea caravan.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.038
What happened?

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.759
There are Japanese among them.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.800
What?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.959
Yao, what's going on?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.880
Why are there Japanese in the caravan?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.520
Let go of me!

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.798
You insisted on joining this deal.

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:47.598
Was it only to help them move tungsten?

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:48.838
Yao, don't worry.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.518
It's just daily goods in there.

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.959
I only did this for you.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.239
Many in the Pei family
still don't support you.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.038
If we give them a little convenience,
we can gain outside support.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.479
It benefits us more than it harms us.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.278
I don't need their support.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.719
I already have
the Lian family pinned down.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.679
The three-month deadline is almost here.
I'm about to take over as family head.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.439
I don't need you meddling any further.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.439
Do you understand?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.078
Cut all ties with them immediately.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.199
If you dare ruin my plans,

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:13.559
I won't spare you.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:51.159
Why are you drinking?

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.079
I'm feeling uneasy.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.600
I don't know
if our plan tomorrow will go smoothly.

00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:09.439
Don't overthink it.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.040
I'm not ready to sleep yet.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.760
Why do you have this photo?

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:31.959
I got it back from the tailor.

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.360
This picture is awful.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.239
Look at it. My face looks so distorted.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.040
I don't want it.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.599
But it's our very first photo together.

Uncles.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.840
The three-month term has passed.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.718
Under Yao's management,
the Pei family has run in order.

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:01.119
Nothing has gone amiss.

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:02.759
According to our agreement,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.919
Yao should now be able
to take over as family head.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.798
If any of you still have doubts,

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.639
I am ready to address them.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.599
If that's the case,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.000
we have no objection

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.679
to Yao becoming the family head.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.400
Wait a moment.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.520
Jiang Yao is not qualified
to be family head.

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:28.599
Third Granduncle, you made
this agreement with Yao yourself.

00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:31.599
You can't go back on your word
just because someone swayed you.

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.119
If Jiang Yao had shown
true responsibility,

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.039
I would honor my promise.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.678
But just like Pei Yujie,

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.519
he colluded
with the Japanese in secret,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.480
bringing shame on the Pei family.

00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:44.399
How can he be fit to lead?

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.079
Third Granduncle, don't slander me!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.919
My father was indirectly
killed by the Japanese.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.200
How could I ever work with them?

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.599
Here is the proof.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.638
These are the Japanese
who mixed in with the caravan.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.359
Judging by the weight of the crates,

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.279
there's no way they contain tea.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.040
Jiang Yao,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.920
you're the one in charge
of the tea trade now.

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.519
Without your approval,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.840
who would dare do this?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.718
We admit it.

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:18.798
There are things inside
that aren't tea leaves.

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:20.519
But they're just daily goods.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.718
Supplies are scarce now.

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:23.599
We only wanted
to make a little more profit.

00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:25.718
We'd never dare do anything else.

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:26.399
Even now,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.759
you're still denying it.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.879
Wen Yuan, bring him here.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.718
Yes.

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:31.679
Go on.

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:39.439
Miss Pei,

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.039
take a good look. Do you know this man?

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:44.158
Why not let him tell everyone

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:46.039
whether those crates
hold daily goods or not?

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.318
Lian Xinruo, what's the meaning of this?

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:49.678
You drag in some stranger

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.239
and think you can frame us?

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:54.199
We've already seized the final shipment.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.199
It's on its way to the Pei family now.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.600
Soon, we can inspect it together

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:01.199
and see what's really inside.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.838
Second Master! Second Master!

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:06.959
Second Master!

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:09.999
Forgive me. The shipment was stolen.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.120
What?

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:31.079
Second Uncle, now you have no witness,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.560
and no physical evidence.

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:34.919
Do you still plan
to accuse us with nothing?

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:42.359
Whether it's daily goods
or tungsten ore,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.960
the fact remains.
You colluded with the Japanese.

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:46.679
So in any case,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.320
Jiang Yao can never be family head.

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:52.879
What? With your condition,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.758
how can you be family head?

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.039
Of course he can!

00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:59.599
Everyone has seen
Yuze's character and ability.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.560
There's no one more suitable
than him to lead.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.838
What do the two of you think?

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.718
Impossible! He's on the verge of death.

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:07.999
How can he be family head?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.838
Jiang Yao!

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:10.719
Yes, with Yuze's health...

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:12.439
Who said I'm on the verge of death?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.959
Yuze has already recovered.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.360
I am willing...

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:19.759
to take over as family head.
