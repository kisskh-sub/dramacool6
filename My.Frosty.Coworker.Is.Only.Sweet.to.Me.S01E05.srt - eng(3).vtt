Do you have plans after this?

No.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.867
I'd like to stay with you longer.

I can't believe this is happening.

I'll throw this away.

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:03.834
I'll help.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.567

No. Sorry, I just don't usually visit other people's places.

No, no, it didn't.

I got all heated up like that. Silly me!

He seemed really used to doing all that.

00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:16.867
He's probably got lots of experience, unlike me.

Stop it, focus on work.

Get it together, girl!

What's wrong?

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.134
I broke up with my girlfriend.

00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:39.134
- What?
- Oh, dear me. How come?

00:08:39.134 --> 00:08:41.100
How come?

- You aren't too reliable, are you?
- What do you mean by that?

- I guess it's a matter of communication skills.
- Maybe so.

- That's really important.
- Right.

- I'm sure of that.
- Where's Soma-kun?

- Chief!

Make sure he gets a compensatory day off.

Yes, that's right!

Oh, really?

This way, please.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.933
Excuse me.

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:55.300
You were a great help the other day.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.866
- Likewise.
- Oh, we enjoyed it, too.

00:09:57.866 --> 00:10:02.033
Thanks to you, we got many customer surveys,

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:06.033
and we want to focus more on boosting product awareness.

So we'd like upper top exposure on our website.

I understand.

Can we go over it in detail?

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:21.866
Yes, of course.

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:24.800

- All right then.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.466
It's been an hour. Shall we take a break?

00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:32.866
Sounds good.

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.766
Yes.

00:10:38.826 --> 00:10:41.333
- So we're on the same page.
- Right.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:42.990
- Hello?
- Can we finish in another hour?

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.280
I think so.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.660
Excuse me for a moment.

00:10:51.066 --> 00:10:53.566
So, Kotori.

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:57.133

00:10:57.133 --> 00:10:59.933
You know, between you and Soma-kun.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.533
You're so obvious!

00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:08.100
I saw right through you.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.700
I know you went home together.

00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:16.733
So... are you two dating?

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.000
We started officially going out after the event.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.533
No way! Seriously?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.800
Really?

00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:38.766
So you and Soma-kun, wow!

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:41.345
I can see it.

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:45.133
Wait, how did it all start in the first place?

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:46.466
Do you really want to know?

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:47.800
I really do!

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.666
It wasn't a special reason.

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:54.490
Is it secret? Won't you tell me?

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.566
How nice! So you guys are lovey-dovey.

00:11:58.566 --> 00:12:01.070
Yes.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:05.890
All this went on in front of me,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.360
and I didn't notice at all.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.066
Has he slept over already?

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:19.800
Your face! He has, right?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.600
Stop it.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.566
Come on, we're at work!

00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:26.000
No way...

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.500
Shall we continue?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.333
Of course.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.900
Sorry, I'm fine.

00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:38.133
Well... where were we?

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:42.266
We were deciding what elements to incorporate.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.600
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, that's right.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.429
- Sorry!
- Are you okay?

00:12:47.429 --> 00:12:48.566
I'm fine.

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:50.633
Well, could you wipe there?

00:12:50.633 --> 00:12:52.233
I'm so sorry.

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.533
Your suit is wet.

00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:57.066
- Sorry.
- Do you need to change?

00:12:57.066 --> 00:12:59.033
No, I'm fine.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.733
Need more tissues?

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:04.800
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.933
Thanks.

00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:21.700
Takamine-san seemed off after he took that phone call.

00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:24.570
I wonder what it was.

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:31.200
Sure, will next Tuesday work for you?

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:41.933
Man... That hit me harder than I expected.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.566
How do these stay on there?

00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:01.500
I don't know... wait, look here.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.766
- Glue?
- it's probably wire, not glue.

00:14:03.766 --> 00:14:06.100
- Hi, Soma-kun.
- It must have been rough, yes?

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.800
- Frosty...
- Hey, Soma, I'm about to...

00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:16.200
- Soma-kun?
- Koto...

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.166
Ogata-san, were you okay after that?

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:27.533
I wonder what he meant by "after that."

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.533
Something happened between them for sure.

00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:33.000
Right! I'm dying to know!

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.789
- I was going to call...
- Wait, Soma-kun!

00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:40.533
Well... You should go report to the chief first.

00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:44.900
He looks so neglected.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.466
Okay.

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:56.166
Was he going to discuss it in the office?

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:58.966
- Take a seat.
- No, I'm okay.

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:08.033
I can't stand everyone looking at me like that.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.733
Kotori-san!

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.130
I'm sorry about yesterday.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.100
I was going to apologize, but then I got a call about an issue.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's okay, that's not a problem.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:37.066
I'm sorry I acted like that and made you worry.

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:41.600
C-Could you back off a bit?

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.780
Are you...

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.633
angry at me?

00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:03.100
Is it because I said I wouldn't do anything,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.660
then kissed you like that?

00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:19.300
I-I'm not angry, no, no.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.133
But we're at work.

00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:29.800
I'd really appreciate If you could keep our private life out of work.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.866
But why?

00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:37.720
I want my work life and private life to be separate,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.960
with clear boundaries between the two.

00:16:41.966 --> 00:16:44.600
"Boundaries"?

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:51.740
Also, I've never dated anyone before.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.900
I'd appreciate if we could take it slow.

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.333
I understand.

00:17:01.466 --> 00:17:04.640
Sure, you may be used to this.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.930
I'm new to dating so I need time to prepare myself.

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:12.733
I'm a newbie, too.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:14.900
What?

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.066
You're the first person I've ever properly dated.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.933
Are you joking?

00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:27.100
I mean, all he's done so far...

00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:30.766
A hug to seal the deal.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:33.900
This is what a boyfriend does.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.333
He seemed so used to it.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.100
Really? Is this really Soma-kun's first time dating someone?

00:17:56.933 --> 00:18:00.033
If that's true...

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:04.500
Is something wrong?

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:14.166
No, nothing.

00:18:15.066 --> 00:18:17.000
Really?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.266
Yes.

00:18:18.266 --> 00:18:20.433
So we're both newbies.

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:33.266
I'm new to this love stuff

00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:39.133
so how will I make him, who's also a newbie, slow down?

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:43.233
Ogata-san, can you check this?

00:18:43.233 --> 00:18:45.566
"Boundaries."

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:51.700
Okay...

00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:09.260
I'd like to keep this signature font of Strawberry Milk here,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.766
but then highlight it more.

00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:15.500
- Add a shadow for a 3D look?
- That could work.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.566
- I like how it looks slightly melty.
- I see.

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:22.200
- It's super fierce, like it's yelling at you.
- That's true.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.533
I think we could adjust the color.

00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:28.334
- Yes, maybe.
- Like the color of Strawberry Milk.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.990
- You're right!
- No, we've already chosen the color.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.300
Then how about the dots?

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.408
Maybe we should add dots.
[Focus on the meeting!]

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.588
On the contrary, checkered may be nice.

00:19:36.588 --> 00:19:39.779
- Chief, you are like Strawberry Milk!
- Shut up.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.181
Maybe he can't devise anything.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.618
Perhaps a more Showa style

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:47.753
- would make more impact.
- That's true.

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:54.833
[Idee]

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:58.526
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.090
Kotori-san!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.569
Walk home with me halfway?

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.505
I'll go home early today.

00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:07.600
Chief, have you an appointment tonight?

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.028
- Sorry, I'm in a rush. I'll go alone.
- Today is my son's birthday.

00:20:10.028 --> 00:20:11.577
- He's turning ten.
- See you tomorrow.

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.666
Wow, congrats!

00:20:13.666 --> 00:20:15.200
Good night.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200
What's up, Soma?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.666
Nothing, Sir.

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:24.700
- You can always come to me...
- Good night.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.033
Have a good evening.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.700
Good evening to me!

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:56.033
What's the right distance to have when setting relationship boundaries?

00:20:56.033 --> 00:21:00.233
Maybe I was too cold to him?

00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:04.360
Things are finally official,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.030
but what do I do now?

00:21:10.466 --> 00:21:14.866
I should start by apologizing to Soma-kun.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.330
[Mai-chan]

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:24.033
Hello? Mai-chan?

00:21:27.033 --> 00:21:28.966
What, now?

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:33.533
I was just in the mood to see my old high school friends.

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:35.900
It'll be a girls' night.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.366
[I'm sorry I rushed home today.]

00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:46.633
[I'm having a girls' night out with a high school friend.]

00:21:46.633 --> 00:21:48.233
[Okay. Have fun.]

00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:51.366
[Text me when it's over. I'll come get you.]

00:21:51.366 --> 00:21:53.900
Hey, Kotori! Long time, no see!

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.200
Mai-chan!

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.315
- Hey. It's been a while.
- I'm so glad to see you!

00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:01.200
Me, too!

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.700
You still have that soothing aura and warm hands.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.900
I haven't seen Ekko and Kumi in ages.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.300
Oh, they couldn't make it.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.600
So I called some other old friends from Nish High School instead.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.900
- Okay.
- Let's go. It's been so long!

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.666
- Yes, it's been long! How have you been?
- Indeed.

00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:22.566
- Great!
- How's work going?

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:26.700
I'm so glad you haven't changed a bit.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.239
- Neither have you.
- Really?

00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:31.066
- I think you got cuter.
- Oh, thanks.

00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:32.400
There they are.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.166
Over here!

00:22:36.566 --> 00:22:38.666
Takamine-kun?

00:22:38.666 --> 00:22:40.366
Ogata...

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:46.600
What's going on? I thought this was a girls' night?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.533
Sorry, but it's okay, right?

00:22:49.533 --> 00:22:51.866
A mini high school reunion.

00:22:51.866 --> 00:22:53.533
You didn't tell me, either.

00:22:53.533 --> 00:22:58.166
Come on, it's been so long since we hung out.

00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:00.133
- I missed you guys. Thanks.
- Same.

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:02.866
- Let's drink!
- Let's sit down, Kotori.

00:23:02.866 --> 00:23:04.500
"I missed you guys"?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.700
- But I did!
- It's been too long.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.120
- Totally.
- How are you?

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.266
- Great.
- Good to hear.

00:23:10.266 --> 00:23:12.333
- What shall we drink?
- What are you having?

00:23:12.333 --> 00:23:14.066
- Oolong cocktail.
- A highball then.

00:23:14.066 --> 00:23:19.000
How will I explain this to Soma-kun?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.040
Not done yet?

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:23.866
Finally.

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:28.260
I hope she's having fun.
