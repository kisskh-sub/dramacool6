00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.348
They're so different from the photos.

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:07.832
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:10.023
- Can we take a photo with you?
- Sure, of course.

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:11.777
Thank you so much!

00:13:15.402 --> 00:13:17.889
Azusa, can I take a picture with you?

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:20.581
Sorry. I've got something to do.

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.344
- No way...
- So cool.

00:13:27.826 --> 00:13:29.626
What's wrong?

00:13:30.232 --> 00:13:31.859
Are you okay?

00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:35.191
Azusa, what are you doing here?

00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:37.388
You suddenly started running.

00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:40.728
Ah, sorry. You've got it wrong.

00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:46.230
I just got a little sulky, that's all.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.550
What?

00:13:49.337 --> 00:13:52.812
I was the only one getting excited.

00:13:54.921 --> 00:14:00.723
When I see you out here,
you feel like someone I can't reach.

00:14:02.856 --> 00:14:06.001
I feel like you are strangers.

00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:13.769
Someone unreachable, huh?

00:14:16.027 --> 00:14:17.253
What?

00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:19.444
Thank you so much.

00:14:20.368 --> 00:14:22.157
Why?

00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:25.420
To be honest, it doesn't feel bad

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.890
being thought of as someone out of reach.

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:33.443
But you see...

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:37.535
I don't want you to keep thinking of me that way.

00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:39.429
It's a bit troubling.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:47.178
See? You can easily reach me.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.874
You have to reach me.

00:14:56.874 --> 00:15:03.042
Because you're the only one in the world
who is closest to me.

00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.313
Isn't that right?

00:15:14.024 --> 00:15:15.964
Let's go home.

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:18.141
We're having a party, right?

00:15:21.267 --> 00:15:22.860
Yeah.

00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:27.986
Wow, that looks so delicious!

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:29.383
Amazing!

00:15:29.383 --> 00:15:31.964
And, and...

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.105
Let's see.

00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:35.762
Ta-da!

00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:38.592
Huh?

00:15:38.592 --> 00:15:42.295
Hey, I said the cake should be
chocolate-flavored, right?

00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:45.392
- Huh?
- But this plate is so cute.

00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:47.565
Matsuri said she loves chocolate cakes!

00:15:47.565 --> 00:15:49.207
I also love strawberry shortcakes a lot.

00:15:49.207 --> 00:15:52.461
- Chocolate isn't the only thing I like.
- But you did say chocolate, didn't you?

00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:55.334
Then don't leave it up to me.
What's wrong with choosing something cute?

00:15:55.334 --> 00:15:56.904
What's with that tone?

00:15:56.904 --> 00:15:58.442
It wouldn't be an issue
if you didn't pick a fight in the first place.

00:15:58.442 --> 00:16:00.335
It would be fine if you'd
just gotten a chocolate cake.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.608
Isn't this cute?

00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:04.783
- Huh? It's not about being cute.
- Both of you, that's enough!

00:16:04.783 --> 00:16:06.239
What?

00:16:07.197 --> 00:16:10.371
Didn't we promise to cooperate
for Matsuri just for today?

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:12.532
If you hadn't asked this guy for help,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:15.366
- You don't have to get so mad either.
- Huh? Shut up, idiot.

00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:16.375
Since the plate is chocolate,

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.743
- it had to be a chocolate cake.
- What kind of logic is that?

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.180
You made the mistake!

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.243
I hate this.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.949
I already know.

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:31.527
I know that magazines and TV
are all just illusions,

00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:36.182
but I still want the three of them to get along.

00:16:36.182 --> 00:16:38.287
I want them to be smiling.

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:41.042
Because...

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:44.329
I told you to stop, didn't I?

00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:51.933
- Huh?
- W-Wait a minute...

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.145
What?

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.934
Matsuri!

00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:11.290
- Are you okay?
- Matsuri?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.001
Matsuri!

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:19.116
Matsuri!

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.421
Thank God!

00:17:21.421 --> 00:17:24.016
You haven't been sleeping lately.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.996
You're all here together.

00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:31.217
That's the first thing you are thinking?

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:36.428
But just a moment ago, it looked like
you were about to start a fistfight.

00:17:36.428 --> 00:17:38.163
- How did you make up?
- How could we keep fighting

00:17:38.163 --> 00:17:40.676
when we saw you faint right before our eyes?

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:44.626
That's obvious, right?
We all care about you.

00:17:44.626 --> 00:17:49.230
No matter what, we are your brothers.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.123
Happy face!

00:17:58.015 --> 00:18:00.957
Happy face!

00:18:08.772 --> 00:18:11.802
Sorry, Azusa, I hit you with a puff by accident.

00:18:11.802 --> 00:18:14.468
It's okay. We were at fault, too.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:17.432
And sorry about the handmade cream puffs.

00:18:17.432 --> 00:18:18.611
Really sorry.

00:18:18.611 --> 00:18:20.961
No... but...

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:27.836
Then, let's call it even.

00:18:31.554 --> 00:18:34.107
A sign of reconciliation, as siblings.

00:18:34.107 --> 00:18:37.019
Of course not.
What you're doing is weird.

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:39.692
- No, there's no deeper meaning or anything.
- No cutting in line.

00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:42.506
Matsuri, please get away. It's dangerous.

00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:43.922
Sure.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:48.284
Listen, Matsuri is everyone's little sister.

00:18:48.284 --> 00:18:53.460
All right, I'll go get a drink
for cute little Matsuri, okay?

00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:57.243
Don't touch her.

00:18:57.243 --> 00:18:58.694
Okay.

00:18:58.694 --> 00:19:00.703
I'll also quickly go pick some flowers.

00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:02.349
Azusa, don't get close to her.

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:04.396
I get it already.

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.618
Sorry about that.

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:21.472
I mean, idols really have an
incredible impact, don't they?

00:19:21.472 --> 00:19:25.467
But it's okay.
I'll do my best to get used to it soon.

00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:30.803
Well, it'd be a problem
if you got too used to it, though.

00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:32.202
Huh?

00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:37.186
I was gearing up for a long haul.

00:19:37.186 --> 00:19:38.683
Huh?

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:41.614
But I will...

00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:48.294
I'll use my strengths without holding back.

00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:53.956
So, hurry up and figure it out already.

00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:56.489
You're so clueless...

00:19:59.043 --> 00:20:01.996
I still don't trust him after all!

00:20:03.543 --> 00:20:05.336
I don't know what Azusa might do.

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:08.547
So, let's all sleep together tonight.

00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:09.743
What?

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:11.687
I brought some water.

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:25.156
Can't sleep?

00:20:25.156 --> 00:20:26.737
I'm sorry.

00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:33.713
Thanks, Matsuri.

00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:36.433
Huh?

00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:39.320
Had you not been here,

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.590
I probably wouldn't have
partied with Haruka or Rihito outside of work.

00:20:45.798 --> 00:20:47.687
Neither is this co-sleeping party.

00:20:51.677 --> 00:20:53.070
I haven't done anything.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.076
Just having you here is enough.

00:20:58.337 --> 00:21:02.050
With you being in the family,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.950
it seems we can be
a little more honest with ourselves.

00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:17.846
I thought about it just a little.

00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:24.767
The reason my heart races
isn't because you're an idol,

00:21:25.804 --> 00:21:30.602
but because I think you're charming.

00:21:32.904 --> 00:21:39.753
Even if you weren't an idol,
I'm sure I would still...

00:21:40.957 --> 00:21:44.461
I think I would definitely
become a fan of yours!

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.874
Huh? Wait.

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:12.847
Sorry. Was my voice too loud just now?

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.766
Good night.

00:22:17.327 --> 00:22:19.407
Good night.

00:22:27.398 --> 00:22:30.493
What am I even doing?

00:22:30.493 --> 00:22:33.309
She's just too close...

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:37.122
Follow my cue.

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:39.419
Five, six, seven, eight, and now!

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:41.227
Two, three, four...

00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:43.001
A little more.

00:22:48.005 --> 00:22:50.320
Since the night of the party,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.020
my brothers started intense training
for their live performance.

00:22:56.687 --> 00:23:01.297
It was like they were
completely different people, so diligent...

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:07.219
and so intense that it made me cringe...

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:18.535
I'm sorry!

00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:20.935
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

00:23:26.692 --> 00:23:29.265
What's wrong?

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:32.779
She's an acquaintance of mine, this girl.

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:35.521
Oh? An ex-girlfriend?

00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:38.315
No, no, not at all.

00:23:38.315 --> 00:23:42.221
Well, if I had to say...

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:48.151
I guess I'm like her ideal big brother.

00:23:48.151 --> 00:23:49.890
­[This drama is fiction.]

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:53.830
Because you were always with me,
[Romantic rival is her childhood friend?]

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.510
I don't think I ever felt lonely back then.
[Romantic rival is her childhood friend?]

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.139
I've fallen for you.

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:03.239
I can't see you as just a little sister anymore.
[Azusa's confession? A heart-pounding moment!]
