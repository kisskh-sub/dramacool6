WEBVTT

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.570
What on earth is going on?

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.680
What's this announcement
Soo Jung is supposed to make?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.950
Is she announcing her wedding
or something?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.680
That's what I thought,
but I don't think that's it.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.450
- It's more important than a wedding.
- Then what is it?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.660
Let's just wait.
We'll find out when Soo Jung gets here.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.160
Do I really have to be here?
I just want to go to my room.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.430
Stay put.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.600
Our whole family needs to know this today.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.930
An important truth
is about to be revealed.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
It'll be a shock to someone, I'm sure.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.040
Because their disgusting true self
will be revealed.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.040
And they've managed to hide it so well.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250
Soo Jung might just drag them out
by their hair.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.910
Who's getting their hair dragged?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.930
Are you out of your mind?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Let go of me!

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.100
How can you sleep at night
after putting my mother in a nursing home?

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.610
- Ms. Soo Jung.
- What you did was a crime!

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480
You're the one who needs to be punished!

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.150
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.550
Am I invisible to all of you?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.830
Min Kyung Chae...

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.330
She locked my mother up in a nursing home.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.030
Did you know about this?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640
My mom died a miserable death!

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.940
Answer me!

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.840
Is what she's saying true?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.610
How could that be true?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.810
She heard some nonsense somewhere
and is blaming the wrong person.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.680
Snap out of it.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.990
I don't know who's playing you,
but stop accusing an innocent person.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.290
You feel wronged?

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.190
You feel wronged?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.090
- How dare you say you've been wronged!
- Please, Ms. Soo Jung.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.600
My mother's death is all your fault!

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.070
Are you delusional?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.240
Snap out of it! And stop talking nonsense!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.370
- I'm going to kill you!
- Ms. Soo Jung!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.880
Good.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.950
Go on, tear each other apart.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.920
The more you do,
the closer I get to my revenge.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.850
Stop it, all of you!

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Gosh.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820
Are you all right?
You're going to collapse at this rate.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.860
- Please, go inside.
- For goodness' sake.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Oh, dear.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.160
How could she?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.170
How could she do that to my mom?

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.090
(All Audio Files)

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.690
(Lucia)

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
(Move To Trash)

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.080
Oh my.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.680
You look exhausted.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.710
Did you sleep in Se Ri's room again?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.720
I wanted to make sure
you got a good night's sleep.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.420
Gosh.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.990
This won't do. You should just rest today.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.290
I can't. I have an important meeting.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.100
For goodness' sake.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.930
Gosh.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.540
I'm so upset for you.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.110
After that huge scene last night,
how can they not say a single word?

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.350
How can your children act like that?
You've succeeded at everything else,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.120
but raising your kids
has been a total failure.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.720
I suppose you're not wrong.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.820
Do you really have to go?
I was hoping you'd stay.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.360
I'll be fine.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.230
Stop giving the chairman such a hard time.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.800
He could barely get out of bed
this morning.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.070
But...

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.280
How did you know about
what happened to my mother?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.750
What was your motive for calling me?

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.220
You knew exactly how I'd react.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.920
What are you talking about?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.090
You mean about your birth mother?

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.650
What?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.360
What do you mean, "what?"

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.990
You contacted the caregiver beforehand.
What are you playing at?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.700
Me?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.100
You're one scary woman.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100
Fine.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.710
I'm taking this recording to the company
to play for my dad.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.010
I might go down with you,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.750
but I'm sick of you playing
the perfect wife...

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.250
with that innocent look on your face.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.650
What recording?

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.820
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.560
The deal you and I made.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.090
It was recorded on here.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.890
Wait, what?

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Why is it gone?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.200
How did this get deleted?

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.130
Did you do this?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.300
Was this you?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.940
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.770
Are you still drunk?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.110
Then why don't you sober up
and go back to work?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.490
Hey, are you okay?

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.300
What was all that about last night?

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.670
Did Kyung Chae really put
your mom in a nursing...

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.730
Ji Seop.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.900
Sorry,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.200
but I don't want to see your face today.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.410
Hey, why?
I'm the only one who's on your side.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440
That may be true,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.980
but right now, I can't stand you either.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.150
- You share the same blood as Kyung Chae.
- And so do you!

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.690
You may only be half-sisters,
but her blood runs in you too.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.730
That's why right now I feel like
draining all the blood from my body!

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.100
Darn it all!

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.840
Hey, perfect timing.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.310
Hey, is it true?

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.010
That you put Soo Jung's birth mother
in a nursing home...

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080
Is that what's important?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.120
- It's important to Soo Jung!
- What's important is...

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.120
why she found out right now, of all times,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.090
and who she found out from.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.460
What is that supposed to mean?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.730
That was the first time
Soo Jung and I ever teamed up.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.260
You know that.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.260
When have I ever been on her side before?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.330
That's true. You two have always been
like cats and dogs.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.000
A life-or-death relationship.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.470
If one falls, the other pounces.
Your loss is my gain, that kind of thing?

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.810
So what made you two decide to team up
all of a sudden?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.910
We had to if we wanted to kick that woman
out of the house.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.150
That woman? You mean Lucia?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.550
It was a first for me.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.920
I guess half-sisters are still sisters.
It actually didn't feel bad teaming up.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.720
But then this whole thing blew up
out of nowhere.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.130
It's painfully obvious what will happen
between me and Soo Jung now.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.370
Are you saying someone deliberately tried
to drive a wedge between you two?

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.530
To make you turn on each other?

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.300
Who on earth would do that?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.040
Goodness.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.150
- What brings you here?
- I came to see if you were all right.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.350
Oh, gosh.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.050
If you're really not feeling well,
please go see Doctor Kim.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.850
I've had so much on my mind lately,
I just feel completely run-down.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.890
Still no apology
from your granddaughters today?

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.930
An apology? Not a chance.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.230
That's just awful.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.370
How could they treat
their own father like that?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.440
Please don't be too upset.
I'll make up for them.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.670
You can't force an apology from them
if they don't mean it.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.990
Well, well.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.390
You seem to be here a lot.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.920
The chairman must be a happy man.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.560
Thanks to his young
and beautiful companion.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.030
- Don't start with me.
- I'm saying, if you three are a team...

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.900
then it's clear Stella Jang
and Moon Tae Kyung...

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.770
also have some history with Mingang
or Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.310
Stop making up stories. It's pathetic.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.410
We'll just have to wait and see
if it's fiction, won't we?

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.620
Then again,
seeing all three of you exposed at once...

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.650
that would be quite a show.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.740
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.880
She's made herself right at home,
hasn't she?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.380
I was on my way to see the chairman.
Am I not allowed in here?

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.950
The fact you're Soo Jung's birth mother...

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.720
You leaked that, didn't you?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.020
What are you talking about?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.230
Because you knew
it would make me turn against Soo Jung.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.130
Since when were you two so close?

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.840
Anyone who didn't know better
would think you were such close sisters.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.600
At least it was never this bad.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.680
What do you get from stirring up trouble
in my family?

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.580
My conscience is clear,
so don't go accusing innocent people.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080
Your conscience is clear?

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.520
Don't make me laugh.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.420
You want Father to get so fed up with us
that he'll only have eyes for you.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.390
Do you think anyone is falling
for your little scheme?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.560
Watch your mouth.
How dare you accuse me of scheming?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.860
Is that really the best you've got?

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.530
What did you just say?

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.270
If you wouldn't do it before the chairman,
you shouldn't do it in front of anyone.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.410
Or go ahead and say that
to the chairman's face.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.340
Could you?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.660
What's that woman doing here?

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.540
You're here?

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.210
I had an errand nearby, so I stopped in.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.580
Is everything all right?

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.110
I was about to ask you the same thing.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.080
I'm doing fine,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.050
but I get the feeling that you're not.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
Wait...

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.460
You're not letting that family
walk all over you, are you?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560
Okay, good.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.570
I just wanted to see you. That's all.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.570
You should get going.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.540
Someone might see and get the wrong idea.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.240
Whatever happens, discuss it with Madam.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.580
I will.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.000
So the sisters have officially turned
on each other.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.830
And you're sure you deleted the recording?

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.840
Yes. They won't be teaming up ever again.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.640
If anything, they'll be
at each other's throats.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.240
It's a shame,

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.740
but with his family in that state,
don't you think he might collapse?

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.580
He's too strong-willed.
He won't go down that easily.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.980
True.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.490
But before he collapses,
we need to get his shares.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.720
We can't just let his family take over
Mingang Distribution.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.490
So, is Min Kyung Chae next?

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.400
It won't be easy.
She's the toughest one in that family.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.070
No matter how tough she is,
this will break her.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.210
She can't possibly be okay
after seeing this.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.080
Now it's time for her to pay for her sins.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.090
What was Soo Jung talking about yesterday?
Did you really do that?

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.520
Before we get to that,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.530
shouldn't we be talking about my mother,
who died of stress because of that woman?

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.730
Are you blaming me?

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.470
Blaming you won't change what happened.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.500
That's why I've kept it buried.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.740
If you had, we wouldn't be in this mess!
You're tearing this family apart!

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.410
Do I look okay to you?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.680
I could collapse from stress any second,
watching the way you all are acting.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.120
Can you all just live in peace?

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.820
You two living like enemies for 20 years
has made me sick with worry.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.920
Will you only be satisfied
when you've driven me to my grave?

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.030
Don't shock me any further
if you don't want to see your father die.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.380
What happened to my mother is your fault.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.580
If you want to play the blame game,
your mother started it.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.580
- You think I'll ever forgive you?
- I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.520
I'm done calling you my sister.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.960
Mark my words,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.830
there's no way you'll ever become
the chairman of Mingang Distribution.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.800
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.840
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.520
What's this?

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.190
Who would leave something like this here?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.660
(Condolences)

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.930
What is this?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.000
Who did this?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.410
Who put that picture frame in my office?

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.040
That would be Director Moon Tae Kyung
from the Online Business Team.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.380
She'll be calling for you soon, then.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.590
Without saying anything else,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.220
should I have her look into
the owner of the painting?

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.830
Exactly. Make her find out
where the artist is now.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.600
And by doing so,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.530
she'll find out about your son's
death, right?

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.700
Knowing her, if she learns Ho Se is dead,
she won't just let it slide.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.240
She'll start digging.

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.740
And if she does that,
she'll eventually learn her father did it.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.510
But what if she uncovers your identity
in the process, Madam?

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.680
She won't get that far.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.520
Even though Ho Se is my son,
there's nothing to connect him to me.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.420
I gave him up when he was just a baby
and remarried.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.030
Okay, I understand.
I've got another call. I'll call you back.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.630
Okay.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.000
Yes, Ms. Min.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.470
I was told you brought this here,
Director Moon.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.120
It's a portrait of you, isn't it, Ms. Min?

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.490
I'm asking why you were the one
to bring my portrait here.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.290
I didn't realize it was a portrait.
I got it from a courier in the lobby.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.030
He asked for this office, as I was coming,
I offered to bring it up.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.100
And the sender?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.300
It's not written on there?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.640
He didn't say anything to me about it.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.910
But why is there a black ribbon
on your portrait?

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.240
It's not like it's a funeral portrait.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.310
I guess someone wants me dead.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.150
Who on earth would do such a thing?

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.020
Do you have any idea who it might be?

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.190
Then I want you to find out.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.190
Find out who on earth
would pull a stunt like this.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.460
Whoever sent this obviously
has malicious intent.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.100
If we can find out
who the artist of this piece is...

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.470
I already know who that is.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.170
I was the model. How could I not know?

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.110
Well, there you have it.
Don't you think he's the one who sent it?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.940
He's not the kind of person
who would do that.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.510
Then what if
something has happened to him,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.420
and someone sent this on his behalf?

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.660
He's probably living well somewhere
with a good woman.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.960
That makes it even stranger.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.390
In any case, you should look into him.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.600
You never know
what might have happened to him.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.570
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.850
Yes. I just told Ms. Min Kyung Chae
to look into it.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.080
But from what I could tell,
Ms. Min has no idea that your son is dead.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.290
Of course not.
Min Doo Sik would've kept it a secret.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.190
Then, if Ms. Min Kyung Chae
finds out the truth,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.360
all havoc will break loose
between her and her father.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.260
That's the plan.
He must be disgusted with his children...

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.600
so that Chairman Min will hand over
his shares to Lucia.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.310
The more the family's shares are split up,
the easier a takeover will be.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.840
So for us, securing shares is
the priority right now.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.690
You wanted to see me?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.890
I need you to find someone.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.360
Twenty years ago,
in the backstreets of Brooklyn, New York,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.730
there was an obscure artist
who went by Jung Ho Se.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.130
His American name was David Jung.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.240
So you want me to run a background check?

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.100
It won't be easy. It was long ago.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.940
Especially for an unknown artist
with no particular affiliation.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.380
He was in an area called Dumbo,
at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.320
He would have worked
mainly out of a warehouse-style studio.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.420
How do you know all of this
in such detail?

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.550
Did you know him, by any chance?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.590
You don't need to know that.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.720
Just look into it.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.110
You haven't forgotten what I told you,
have you?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640
That you're not to talk to Kyung Chae.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.720
You and I are on the same page,
right, Se Ri?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.790
It's just you and me, okay?

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.540
Do you always have
that much to talk about with Se Ri?

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.640
Aren't you the same with your own mother?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.380
Well, that's because
she's my actual mother.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.240
And how are we any different?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.810
Se Ri and I are closer
than a real mother and daughter.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.550
Oh, really?

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.520
Anyway, about you and Father...

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.720
you're not planning to have another baby,
are you?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.190
Why do you ask?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.230
If you are, just give us a heads-up.
So we can brace ourselves.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.900
Brace yourselves?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.300
Well, you know. We need to be ready...

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.000
for a young master or lady,
whoever it may be.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.970
We can't just be blindsided like that,
you know?

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.210
That's not going to happen,
so don't worry.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.490
What was that about?
Do they not sleep in the same bed?

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.360
Then again, I think she always sleeps
in Se Ri's room.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.400
I looked into the matter you asked about.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.740
But as for the artist, David Jung,
his whereabouts are currently unknown.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.140
What do you mean, "unknown?"

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.750
It means it's difficult to confirm
if he's alive or dead.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.350
So you don't know if he's dead or alive?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.090
Well, we could find out if we tried,
but for now, yes.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.890
But who is he, anyway?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.860
That's all. You may go.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.850
Ja Kyung called earlier.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.980
Sounds like all havoc broke loose
over at their house.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.620
What now?
That house is only quiet on leap day.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.960
It's quiet one day every four years.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.290
Apparently, the older sister-in-law had
the younger's birth mother put in a home.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.630
She said they fought badly, pulling hair,
and now they are sworn enemies.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.230
That’s as crazy as saying
a mole dug the subway.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.770
The older sister-in-law? You mean Ms. Min?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.410
Yes. How could she do something like that?

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.010
So the chairman's blood pressure shot up,
and he's about to collapse.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.510
No wonder his blood pressure's up.
Not with his kids carrying on like that.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.050
Wait, what if the old man
actually kicks the bucket from this?

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.990
He just might.
He's had brain surgery, after all.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320
Wait a second.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.690
If he collapses without a succession plan,
what happens to our Ji Seop?

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.330
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.670
My goodness.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.430
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.130
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.940
What in the...

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.080
No, wait a minute.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.680
I've seen this somewhere before.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.320
Where did I see this?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.740
That's it.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.280
Yes, that's where I saw this.
This is unbelievable.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.380
It all links up like this?

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.290
Ms. Min.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.130
The artist you had me investigate.
Is he the one who painted your portrait?

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:57.890
Yes, he is.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.060
What was he to you?

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.370
We were engaged.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.230
Engaged?

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940
I see.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.110
There's something else.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.450
I've confirmed the artist is deceased.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680
Are you sure?

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.620
I just received confirmation.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.160
Are you all right, ma'am?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.830
Well then,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.060
since the artist has passed away,

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.330
I guess that makes this painting
his final work.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.800
Usually, a posthumous work is kept
by the family.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.140
Then whoever sent you the painting...

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.870
must be a member of the artist's family.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.080
Maybe so.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.480
But why frame it like a funeral portrait?

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.120
Do they have
some kind of grudge against you?

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.820
But I thought they didn't have any family.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.320
I'm sure I was told
they didn't have parents.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.290
You were?

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.240
What are you doing here?

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.010
I'm just here to confirm something.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.420
Stella Jang.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.320
Your Korean name is Jang Yeon Sook,
correct?

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.020
That's a little out of the blue.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.360
And?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.890
David Jung.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.230
His Korean name is Jung Ho Se.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.230
And you're his mother.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.120
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.900
You really have a family?

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.540
Does that mean your family wants me dead?

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.170
Did you find them? Who is it?

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.110
Who could it be, Moon Tae Kyung?
Do you have anyone in mind?

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.880
There's nothing more heartbreaking
than having your child taken from you.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.480
We have to get Se Ri away from that woman.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.680
Is this will real?
I'm asking you, is it real?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.150
What I did! I don't regret it one bit.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.160
