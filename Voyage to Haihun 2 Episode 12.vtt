=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 12=

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.640
What kind of nonsense slogan is that?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.820
For Mortal Rank,
everything is the worst.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.310
So many people
crammed into one shabby room.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.480
We have only one blanket

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.810
and sleep on straw mats.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.570
Alright, enough.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.480
I've already set a meeting with them.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.790
We'll meet later to share news.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.640
Come on.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.480
Make way.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.870
Move along.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.460
Lie down, quick.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.320
Brothers.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.590
Tonight we share a bed.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.680
It brings us even closer.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.960
Like one family.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520
A little more, more, more.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.530
Much obliged.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.680
Move over, please.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.520
No more space.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.430
Horse Wang.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.280
Mm.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.220
Let me ask you.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.340
How long
from Mortal Rank to Heaven Rank?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.240
That's hard to say.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.120
Depends on your fortune.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.150
Fortune?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.900
How long have you been at Mortal Rank?

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.450
Seven months.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.560
Seven months.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.380
Seven months.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.080
Then you must have seen Mistress.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.910
Mistress possesses the sacred physique.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.290
She's not someone you can meet at will.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.710
But you're in luck this time.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.630
I heard

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.400
in a little while,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.580
at the Blessing Ceremony,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.710
Mistress will appear in person.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.630
Blessing Ceremony?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.590
That's right.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.240
Every so often,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.150
Mistress goes to the Sacred Land
in the mountains

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.020
to hold a Blessing Ceremony

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.400
and bestow blessings on the family.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.470
So…

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.710
Can we go too?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.520
In the past,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.180
only the blessed ones could attend.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.310
But you've got a rare chance now.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.210
I heard this time,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.870
Mistress is granting a special favor.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.560
For the next seven days.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.600
The first three to finish the task

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.600
will be promoted to Heaven Rank

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.430
and receive Mistress's blessing.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.670
That's wonderful.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.750
What task is it?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.750
What task?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.600
Forty dan.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.540
Forty dan.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.970
Forty dan? That's absurd.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.760
Who could carry all that?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520
What kind of Sacred Land is this?

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.720
I'll go lie in wait now.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.680
Intruders will face heaven's punishment.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.620
Qi,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.680
rest first.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.190
No need to rush.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.910
It will take some effort.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.750
But think about it,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.490
only with Mistress's blessing

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.810
can the sins of a past life be forgiven.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600
This life's cause

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.890
comes from the past life's deeds.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.180
My life is full of hardship,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.270
all because of the wrongs I sowed before.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.690
Only by receiving Mistress's blessing

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.560
can I wash away mortal sins.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.230
In the life to come,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.070
I'll be free from all suffering.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.360
Between us two,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.240
as long as one reaches Heaven Rank,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.270
we might finally meet Mistress.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.900
You're right.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.210
Let's carry those forty dan together.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.490
Come on, let's go.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.240
Hurry, move along.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.160
Have you discovered anything today?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.000
Most Earth Rank are women.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.050
Grinding spices is tiring and repetitive,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.040
yet no one complained.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.700
They seemed delighted.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.970
The Blessing Ceremony is drawing near.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.160
The top 3 in spice grinding will rise
to Heaven Rank.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.510
If the task isn't finished,
what will happen?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.920
It means leaving this place.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.240
So now, everyone is giving it their all

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
for the Heaven Rank

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080
and the blessing.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.310
Returning to where they came from.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.930
It doesn't sound like a punishment.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.630
Still…

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.510
It's better than toiling
in the Marquis' mausoleum.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
Lan'er.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.750
Any news of your parents?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.850
Not yet.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.070
Then let's call it a night.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.720
Continue your own investigations.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.080
And stay safe.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.120
- Wang Heng.
- Wang.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.960
Uh?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.820
I heard Mortal Ranks don't eat well.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.660
This is for you.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.390
Then I thank you, Lan'er.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.310
Let me see.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.470
Dun Flatbread.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.950
My favorite.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.680
It's getting late.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.580
Let me walk you back, Lan'er.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.120
A small token of my thanks.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.120
Hey, wait.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.710
What is it?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.830
I'm hungry.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.770
I'm really starving.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.600
You want me to feed it to your mouth?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Don't go hungry either.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.190
Even on a trip,
you must eat and rest well.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.910
I'm good.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.510
Too much food dulls the senses.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.830
Then I can't go hungry.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.240
I need the strength to work.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.950
Forty dan in seven days.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.440
Then…

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.870
Want me to help you?

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.000
How could I let you do such rough work?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800
Don't worry.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.300
I have my own people.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.770
Greetings, family.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.890
Greetings, family.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.190
Good morning, family.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.490
Morning, family.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.120
Good morning, family.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.920
Morning, family.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.210
Heng.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.010
This is a brilliant plan.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.380
With this, we'll surely get it done.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.310
Come on, you've got this.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.150
Greetings, family.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.660
Greetings, family.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.120
Greetings, family.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920
Heng.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.100
Go, hurry.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.200
They're catching up.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.270
Alright, alright.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.500
Morning, family.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.120
Slow down, easy there.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.880
Good morning.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.780
Morning, family.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.350
Feeling a bit tired.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.790
Come on, you're the best.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.410
Wang Heng.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.920
- I've been thinking.
- Morning.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.460
Why not change it to my name?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160
Right, true.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.870
But if we change names now,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.960
you'd carry all those for nothing.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.120
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.200
You've worked hard.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.550
Keep going, keep going.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.320
Go, Qi Liuhai.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.910
Qi Liuhai, you shine in my heart.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.500
Come on, you can do this.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.080
Go, Qi Liuhai. Keep it up, Qi Liuhai!

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.200
I'm exhausted.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.050
What did you say?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.990
I can't do it anymore.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.390
Look, they're already ahead of you.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.850
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.850
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.840
You've got this, you're the best!

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.120
Go, Qi Liuhai!

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.390
Qi Liuhai, faster, faster!

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.320
We're losing, pick up the pace!

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.390
Much obliged, family.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.440
Wang Heng.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.880
Wang, you've worked hard.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.960
It's nothing, really.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.030
Done?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.880
All done.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.720
Make way, please, make way.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.960
Wang.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.900
What's wrong with you?

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.740
Wang.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.010
Hey,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.200
let me borrow the quilt.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.160
Sorry about that.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.590
Thanks.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.410
Greetings, family.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.290
Hello, family.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.210
Greetings, family.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.090
Hello, family.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.120
Greetings, family.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.980
Earned a fortune again.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.640
- Hey.
- How many dan?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.770
Nine dan today.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.570
- Good.
- Good, nine loads.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.610
A fruitful harvest today.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.030
Horse Wang, did you see your VVVIP?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.870
Didn't notice.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.600
Family, you're amazing.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.250
Since the start of the task,

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.840
no one's ever been as quick as you.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.600
A small matter.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.280
Not like Qi Liuhai,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.680
- always slacking off.
- Morning.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.050
You barely ever see him around.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.390
He's family to me too.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.200
Then count these two dan as his.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.390
- A busy day.
- Greetings.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.440
I see.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.250
Truly a loving family.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.550
A truly loving family.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.940
Family.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.640
What are you doing?

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.870
No need to be polite, family.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.840
No, no, no.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.280
Let me, let me.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.200
Leave it to me.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.780
We're all family, right?

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.530
You look unfamiliar to me.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.470
You're new here, right?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.120
You…

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.320
What's going on, everyone?

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.120
How could you taint the sacred herb?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.660
Dump it out and pick a fresh basket.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.580
Alright, I'll go right away.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.920
Let's move.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.850
Greetings, family.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.820
Greetings, family.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.240
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.660
(Wang Heng, five days, forty dan)

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.500
Greetings, everyone.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.870
- Greetings.
- Greetings, family.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.960
Everyone, my friends,

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.270
my family,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.080
someone's completed the forty-dan task.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.580
Let us all congratulate Wang Heng.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.940
- Impressive!
- Indeed.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.060
Impressive.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.690
Still two Blessing Quotas left today.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.840
- Family,
- Two more to go.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.600
please give it your all.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.800
Alright.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.430
Come on, come on.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.530
Go for it.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:38.720
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.060
This way, please.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.920
Please.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.800
This is the Heaven Single Dormitory.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.000
Lan'er.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320
Why are you here?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.390
Wang, from this day on,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.720
I'll see to all your daily needs.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.390
Take a bath and get changed.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.730
Then put on the Heaven Belt.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.070
Ah.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.080
Wait.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.930
What matters now is finding your parents.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.020
I don't need your care.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.900
Serving you is the mission
of the Earth Rank.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.760
As for worldly ties,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.970
they no longer matter.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.050
What this mission are you talking about?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.830
Finding your parents is what matters.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.000
From this day on,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.440
I belong to you.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.540
Whatever you wish me to do, I shall do.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.340
You are my family now.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.100
Congrats, Heaven Rank family member.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.860
Wang.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.680
Here's your work schedule from now on.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.720
Oversee the warehouse?

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.670
Mm.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.350
When will I get to meet Mistress?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.240
Wang, go bathe and change first.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.560
Wait.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.910
Is it true that

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.790
every male of Heaven Rank

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.470
is paired with a lady of Earth Rank?
