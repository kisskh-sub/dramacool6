[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.850
[Episode 30]

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.590
Beichuan.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.870
How are you feeling now?

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.770
How should I put it?

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.080
Just like Shanghai's weather.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.930
Sunny one moment, rainy the next.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.240
You know what?

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.910
If you take my advice,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.620
I suggest you keep your public position.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
If you're working
in the cultural industry,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.120
holding a university teaching position
is something you can proudly present.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.520
Just look at all those
so-called celebrities.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.930
Every one of them
has a university professor title.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.640
Why?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.060
Don't you know me by now?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.310
I just hate trouble.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.280
You always call it troublesome.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.250
Don't come to regret it later.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.370
And that Tong Tong.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.280
She's definitely got issues.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.060
She's already in her twenties,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.160
her values should be established by now,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680
yet she acts like a teenager.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.870
What is she thinking?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360
Doesn't she know
how much harm she's causing you,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.820
or how it affects herself?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.870
I asked about this for you.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.250
We have a neighbor next door,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.030
who's now a very successful lawyer.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.400
You can sue her for this.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.990
If you can't teach her a lesson,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.840
let the legal system

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.100
educate her properly.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.240
I just

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.250
treat her as a naive young girl.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.960
She has no shame.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.440
Should I have no shame too?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.270
Xiang Beichuan, you know,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.750
your greatest charm

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.710
is swallowing your pain.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.010
Impressive.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.190
If this

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.600
happened to Yan Jun,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.160
that girl would have been
dead 800 times over.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.250
Speaking of Yan Jun.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.250
Our project has been approved.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.990
But government funding is limited.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.250
We'll have to raise most of it ourselves.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.730
You have a good relationship with Yan Jun.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.930
Why don't you ask him?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.030
He's doing well now.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.120
He's a big boss.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.370
If you want to ask, go ahead.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.960
In my experience,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.640
working with him is really frustrating.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.150
Don't be at odds with money.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.610
Even heroes can be
defeated by financial problems.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.050
How about this?

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.400
Come with me.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.870
If you're uncomfortable, I'll talk to him.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.310
After all, I'm not as close to him.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.430
You two have a closer relationship.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.430
Think about it.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.280
Junior.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.520
Senior.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.710
Sorry, are

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840
we late?

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:16.720
No.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.920
It's just that

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.920
when I have meetings

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.980
I prefer to arrive ten minutes early.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.700
I've ordered coffee
for you. Please sit down.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.630
I haven't added anything to the coffee.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.480
Try it.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.190
If it's too bitter,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.720
I can add some sugar for you.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.140
Thank you.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.040
Junior.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.480
No.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.830
Mr. Yan,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.070
have you looked at the project proposal

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.040
I sent you last time?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.120
What do you think?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.120
I've read it.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.210
First of all,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.190
I think it's great

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.630
that you two
are starting a business together.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.950
That's excellent.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.270
But about that proposal,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.310
since we're alumni,
I'll be straightforward.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.110
I don't think it will make money.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.140
Here's the thing, Mr. Yan.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.830
Well,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.760
the cultural industry

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.800
does have lower profit margins.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.750
But what we're aiming for

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.390
is long-term benefits.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.390
For example,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.510
consider this:

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.270
these novels will become

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.160
intellectual property in the future.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.670
If we think more boldly,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.040
they could be adapted
into films or TV series.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.120
So from a long-term perspective,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.010
the prospects are quite promising.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.270
Perhaps you could

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.830
reconsider it.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.480
Long-term...

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.120
Senior.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.720
Capital comes with costs.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.820
Of course, I'm not saying I won't invest.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.760
I have a business partner recently

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.540
and I need to discuss it with her.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.150
You know her.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.190
Here. Xining.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.170
Xining, what brings you here?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.050
Long time no see.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.740
Let me introduce her once more.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.040
Ye Xining, Miss Ye.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.750
Her business is doing very well now.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.960
Her company is bigger than mine.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.530
We're investing
in some projects together now.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.160
That's great!

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.390
We're all friends here.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.390
Right, Beichuan?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.720
Say something.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.070
Look at him getting nervous again.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.870
He goes quiet when he's nervous.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.640
Xining,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.950
have you read the proposal?

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.750
I have.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.050
What do you think?

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.840
I think it's excellent.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.600
But

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.840
we've seen so many projects,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.430
and I think

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.480
it seems like

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.830
they all have
higher returns than this one.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.630
Why should we invest in this one?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.000
Maybe it's a feeling,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.240
or perhaps more

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.140
of a sentimental attachment.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.470
What if we lose money?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.310
If there's a loss, so be it.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.040
If we lose money,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.409
I'll take responsibility.

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.680
This is on me anyway.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.350
It has nothing to do with you.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.800
Compared to Xining,
I seem so small-minded.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.430
I'm just

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.160
shortsighted,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.310
only seeing money.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.510
No, no, not at all.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.050
Yahui.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.430
Shouldn't you bow to Xining?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.360
Well, um...

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.250
Well,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.920
I'll use coffee instead of alcohol.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.510
As for the bow,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.920
let's skip that.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.630
Then,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.530
Beichuan.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.330
Let's do this

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.330
together.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.940
Let's toast to Miss Ye.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.860
Come on.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.000
Over here.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.909
Here, Miss Ye.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.360
I'm sorry. I have something to attend to.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.310
You guys chat.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.490
Let's keep in touch.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.040
Beichuan.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.130
The two of you continue talking.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.590
I have something to do as well.
I'll go first.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.409
Xiang Beichuan!

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.830
Who said you could leave?

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.560
Are we done talking about this?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.870
We're not done yet. You left first.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.530
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.000
I thought we were done discussing this.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.040
We're not done.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.120
You and Yan Jun are playing good cop,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.510
bad cop. Do you think that's clever?

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.270
Yes, it is.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.580
Haven't I been good to you?

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.270
That worthless business plan of yours

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.920
is bound to make any investor lose money.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.750
Then don't invest.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.920
Why shouldn't I invest?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.870
Then invest.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.310
What's with your attitude?

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.110
What attitude should I have?

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.870
You tell me.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.909
Was I supposed to stand up
and bow to you too?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:36.960
Yes, you were.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.809
Get on your knees.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.559
Apologize to me.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.289
How dare you say
there's something wrong with me?

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.000
Can you just let me off the hook?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.840
No.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.260
Why should I let you off?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.670
Whatever you say goes.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.630
I should do whatever you say.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.550
You always call the shots.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.120
Why are you so domineering?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.390
Look in the mirror.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.730
You're describing yourself.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.540
I get it now.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.120
You're saying I'm domineering.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.230
You're saying
I put pressure on you, right?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.790
Then you should look in the mirror too.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.030
You're so selfish.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.600
You only love yourself.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.300
Let's just be friends then.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.980
Fine.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.120
From today on,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.560
we'll stay out of each other's way.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.270
We can be friends if possible.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.030
If we can't be friends,

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.670
then let's not be anything at all.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.480
Got it.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.480
Good.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.040
It's a deal.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.630
Have you been to this restaurant before?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.440
No, I haven't.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.270
I think the sweet and sour ribs here

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.390
are better than the ones at Red Mansion.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.120
Try some.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.490
Excuse me!

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.750
I'll have the sweet and sour ribs

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.910
and three of your specialty dishes.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.910
Yes, sir.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.800
Xining.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.030
I heard that

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.650
your grandfather used to be a minister.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.650
How did you know?

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.480
Well,

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.870
last night I was

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.720
drinking with some business friends.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.320
They all run big businesses.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.000
We got to talking.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.840
They said the current city leaders

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.620
used to work under your grandfather.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.510
They want to see if

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.550
they could use your connection

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.120
to help them acquire some land.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.520
I heard the profits are quite substantial.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
What do you think?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.270
What do you think?

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.200
I refused.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.450
You really know me well.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.390
That's why we're so like-minded.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.440
Besides,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.210
I won't let you do

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.440
anything dangerous.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.440
And also,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.030
money is good,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.240
but it depends on how you earn it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.550
We've learned from past mistakes.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.100
I've actually felt
quite embarrassed about it.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.720
But we're both growing,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.320
both you and me.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.940
Right?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.000
I heard from Yahui that

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.890
you're teaching
at Jiaotong University now.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.530
I'm in the Civil Engineering Department.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.150
Professor Xiang.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.240
Before I came here,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.170
my cousin showed me your writings.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.860
It was like meeting you through your words
before meeting in person.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.500
Well,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.910
I'm embarrassed.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.080
Actually, I'm no longer
teaching at the university.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.390
You don't have to call me Professor.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.360
I'll still call you Professor Xiang.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.620
It feels more natural.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.640
Alright,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.850
whatever feels comfortable for you.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.080
It's my first time here too.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.870
Same here.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.780
Beichuan.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.390
You know one another?

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.320
They're

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.010
my ex-girlfriend and my college classmate.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.250
Professor Ni,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.750
shall we go to another restaurant instead?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.480
Because of the ex-girlfriend?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.710
She

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.820
is a bit unstable.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.120
Who is that woman?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.560
Beichuan's girlfriend.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.030
Xiang Beichuan

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.470
has a girlfriend now?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.140
You didn't know?

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.730
No, I didn't.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.080
You had just gone to Hungary for

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.510
about a week,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.990
and they got together.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.340
Are you serious?

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.630
No, it's not true.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.390
Just kidding.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.080
I'm just joking.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.480
Don't take it seriously.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.960
Where are you going, Xining?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.750
Xining?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.030
Xiang Beichuan!

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.030
I hate you!

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.830
I'll

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.600
throw you to your death.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.020
Well, Yin. What are you doing here?

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.750
You've been following me?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.920
You went to the exhibition
yesterday morning.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.880
Then to a café in the afternoon.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.150
In the evening, you went to a hotel

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.910
on Huanghe Road.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.200
You didn't go home.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.680
This morning you went to Qipu Road.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.080
Are you crazy?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.360
I told you to come to the company
in a few days

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.890
and I'll refund your money.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.390
Every payment at the company
has to follow a process.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.990
Following

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.480
me

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.240
like this won't help at all.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.150
Give me the money now.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.030
Who carries that much cash around?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.130
This is all I have. Will this do for now?

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:26.960
Not enough.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.360
Take it or leave it.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.160
Forget it if you don't take it...

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.080
You really are

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.270
pushing your luck, aren't you?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.390
Trying to snatch my cell phone?

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.630
You have no shame.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.910
Just you wait.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.670
Wait for what?

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.180
Just you wait.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.240
Wait for what?

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.110
Just you wait.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.270
I'll wait.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.350
Ma'am.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.380
Let me make a call.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.260
Is this Professor Ni?

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.150
Hello, this is Xiang Beichuan.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.550
Professor Xiang.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.810
A friend gave me two movie tickets.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.440
Would you like to go with me?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.960
Which day?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.150
Today.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.560
Is that convenient?

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.510
What time?

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.150
The tickets are for 7:15 p.m.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.700
Okay.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.510
Great.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.530
I'll wait for you at the entrance
of the cinema at 7.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.280
Alright.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.180
See you soon.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.270
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.460
Coming.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.550
Are you going out?

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:28.920
Yes.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.530
Where are you going?

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.880
To see a movie.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.040
By yourself?

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.680
With someone.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.150
Do you really have to go?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.030
I must.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.500
What time is the movie?

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.750
It's already 6:30.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.590
I have a watch.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.510
It's too late.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.400
There's still time.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.770
Why do you live in this partition room?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.260
None of your business.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.310
Psychologists say

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.440
mentally ill people prefer

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.070
small, dark spaces.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.710
You're the one
who's mentally ill, aren’t you?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.270
You hate me?

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.160
I don't.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.400
Why not?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.140
Hatred is an emotion.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.930
There's no emotion between us anymore.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:20.860
Xiang Beichuan,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.020
you're so petty.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.920
We've been through tough times together.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.020
At the very least, we're friends.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.590
Miss Ye.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.200
You think we're friends,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.600
so that makes us friends?

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.680
Is everything in this world
just what you think it is?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.750
In your mind,

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.920
am I just a fool?

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.160
We really can't be friends?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.750
We can't.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.650
Give me a reason.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.400
No reason.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.310
No reason is, in itself, an explanation.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.960
Either

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.640
you still hate me,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.640
or

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.310
you still love me.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.610
You just said you don't hate me,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.020
so you must still love me.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.790
It's all about that woman, isn't it?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
As soon as I left,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.440
you got together with her.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.860
You turned the page
faster than flipping a book.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.900
Really living up to your profession.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.630
I was never in your heart, was I?

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.930
Is she very gentle and virtuous?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.880
You must be very comfortable with her.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.880
She revolves around you, looks up to you.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.140
That's the kind of woman you want, right?

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.790
You're actually wearing the shirt,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.920
pants, and shoes I gave you,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.410
and going to the movie with her?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.980
You should take them all off

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.710
and go naked.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.170
When you treat her,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.070
you take her to a restaurant.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.700
Why didn't you
ever take me to restaurants?

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.690
All those hard times I spent with you.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.310
Eating noodles in that tiny storage room.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.000
You think I enjoyed those noodles?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.460
And you take her to movies.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.270
Why her?

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.960
I love movies too.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.140
Your place here is quite nice.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.570
Even has a balcony.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.200
I bet you've spent many nights here

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.000
watching the stars and the moon.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.590
Telling her all your stories.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.590
While you two were here being romantic,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.920
what was I doing out there?

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.920
I was working hard to make money.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.920
Do you know what my life abroad

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.510
has been like?

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.540
I couldn't even get a hot meal every day.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.780
I hated the foreign food.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.500
What are you doing?

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.920
Why are you closing the door?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.350
I'm not finished talking.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.440
Open it.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.640
Open the door!

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.440
Xiang Beichuan!

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.310
You punctured my tire?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.680
Yes, I did. So what?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.480
If I'd known you were
going to the movies with her,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.140
I would've punctured you too.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.960
Who am I making money for?

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.640
For us to have a better life.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.840
If you're so capable,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.320
then earn it yourself. Can you?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.470
I've never even held another man's hand.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.920
Yet you've been
with this woman for so long.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.600
How could you do this to me?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.380
I'll show you what movies are.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.080
[Youth Film Theater]

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.730
Professor Ni.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.550
Professor Xiang.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.550
I'm sorry.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.880
I got held up by something.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.400
Let's hurry inside.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.310
But it's already halfway through.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.840
Why don't we come next time?

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.200
Alright.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.440
In that case,

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.980
let me treat you to a meal.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.120
I've already eaten.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.730
How about we go for a walk?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.930
Sounds good.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.140
Xining.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.270
Professor Xiang.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.090
How many girlfriends have you had before?

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.310
Yes.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.980
What do you mean?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.750
I'm sorry.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.670
I've been to several places today

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.980
and I'm a bit tired.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.460
So where are you living now,
Professor Xiang?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.920
I live in a partition room.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.660
Are you considering
moving somewhere else in the future?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.700
Not for now.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.480
It's quite nice living there

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480
and comfortable.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.720
How many years did you
work at the university?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.000
Five years.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.220
Then you should have been
allocated housing, right?

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.800
The school was going to allocate one,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.160
but I gave up my spot.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.820
People like you are quite rare these days.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.400
But since you've chosen

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.130
to start a company with my cousin,

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.030
it means you must
want to make something of yourselves.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.780
Those dormitory-style buildings

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.380
are no great loss anyway.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.070
Professor Ni.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.180
I'm really sorry,

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.790
but I suddenly have an urgent matter

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.990
and need to leave now.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.020
How about this?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.520
Next time, it's my treat.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.270
Whatever you want to eat, I'll pay.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.200
I'm truly sorry.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.240
Excuse me.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.840
Goodbye.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.920
Don't worry.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.010
I've already called to turn myself in.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.530
I told the police

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.050
that I'll wait for them right here.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.270
Yahui,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.380
have you contacted a lawyer?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.040
Yes.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.640
The lawyer said my voluntary surrender

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.360
might reduce my sentence.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.240
But it could still be

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.750
over ten years in prison.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.260
I never thought

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:03.900
that one day

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.870
I would come back here again.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.910
I thought I'd never return.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.830
Xining,

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.100
do you know

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.540
what I love most about this place?

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.980
It's this big window.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.400
I love how the sunlight
shines through here.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.480
So back then,

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.680
when I knew this would become

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.960
my bridal chamber,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.170
I felt like

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.480
I was the happiest person in the world.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.160
I'm so tired.

Huang Yahui.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.540
The girl you saw that day

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.880
is not my girlfriend.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.970
That was also our first meeting.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.990
She's just someone I was set up with.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.510
She's Sheng Yahui's cousin.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.590
I'm sorry.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.530
I broke your window

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.170
and made a big hole in it.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.720
I'm really sorry.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.720
Professor Ni.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.280
Hello, Professor Xiang.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.270
Am I late?

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.160
No, not at all.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.070
I'm really sorry about yesterday. I...

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.670
It's fine, Professor Xiang.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.520
Professor Xiang,
what would you like to drink?

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.940
I usually drink tea.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680
Professor Xiang.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.110
This is a coffee shop.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.990
They probably don't serve tea.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800
I'm really sorry.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.160
Coffee is fine too.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.750
Although we haven't met many times,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.400
you seem to have apologized
quite a lot, Professor Xiang.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.880
I'm sorry about that.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.970
Professor Xiang.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.510
From our few interactions,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.950
I can tell you're a very sincere person.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.270
But I feel that

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.030
you might have many things

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.760
that you haven't resolved yet.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.210
We haven't known each other for long.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.920
I don't want to add any pressure on you.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.070
Why don't we

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.420
put our relationship on hold for now?

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.550
When you've peacefully

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.550
dealt with everything in your life,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.340
we can see if we
want to develop this further.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.150
What do you think?

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.960
No problem.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.960
Alright then.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.350
Professor Xiang.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.730
Hope to see you again next time.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.230
Goodbye.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.300

Wait a moment.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:28.990
Happy birthday.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.350
Thank you.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.550
Everyone else came so early.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.440
Why are you so late?

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240
Trying to make a grand entrance?

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.130
I'll drink as punishment. Happy now?

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.650
Come, sit here.

We need to talk.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.480
Sure.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.570
I'll drink up.

When did that happen?

Just a couple days ago.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.100
His case has been
going on for quite a while.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.610
He got what he deserved.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.330
How long do you think

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.810
he will be sentenced for?

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.920
The amount in his case is substantial.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.700
His sentence probably won't be short.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880
There's something I need to ask you.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.570
Did you tell Ye Xining

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.940
that I was dating that female teacher

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.790
and had been for quite a while?

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.200
Yeah.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.030
What's wrong?

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.640
Where did you
get the idea I was dating her?

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.310
What's your relationship
with Ye Xining now?

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.270
Nothing.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.670
If there's nothing between you,
what's wrong with me joking around?

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.640
If you two were together,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.000
what I did would be inappropriate.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.110
But you're not together,

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.370
so what's the problem?

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.460
I'm just asking.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.590
Do you still want to be with her?

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.400
No.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.510
Are you sure?

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.030
I'm sure.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.330
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.990
Take your time drinking
and enjoying yourself.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.590
You're here, Xining.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.350
Mr. Yan.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.650
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.650
Happy birthday.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.650
Thank you.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.770
Beichuan is here too.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.610
He's inside.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.920
He came too?

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.230
Let's go in.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.050
Wait a moment.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.100
I'd like to have
a quick chat with you first.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.510
What's your relationship
with Beichuan now?

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.370
Actually, I don't know

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.110
what we are anymore.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.280
So can you two

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.070
still be together?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.600
That mainly depends on him.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.670
Seems you still care about him a lot.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.050
As business people,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.320
we can be domineering sometimes

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.850
because we make more money.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.810
So maybe many things at home,

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.610
like food and clothes,
are actually paid for by us.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760
Over time,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.850
the other person might feel

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.340
a bit inferior.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.960
Inferiority leads to sensitivity.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.820
Sensitivity leads to arguments.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.930
And that's not good in the long run.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:02.840
If

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.480
you two really want to stay together,

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.280
I hope

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.590
Xining, you could tone down

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.720
your dominance a bit.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.930
Things would be much better that way.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.530
Of course, I'm not saying
Beichuan is perfect.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.920
Beichuan

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.530
is always standing still.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.960
Not like us who

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.670
can keep up with the times.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.400
But I think

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.840
keeping up with the times refers to work

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.760
and career,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.400
not love.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.170
Beichuan has always stayed the same,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.000
which means he's very traditional.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.550
That's actually quite good.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.400
For example, when you come home every day,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.660
there might be someone

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.580
who has prepared dinner
and is waiting for you.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.750
If you found someone like me,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.630
out partying every day

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.440
and making a mess,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.100
you wouldn't stand it either.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.600
So what I'm saying is,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.190
if you two

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.080
really want to be together,

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.640
then both of you need to change.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:57.900
Of course,

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.400
if you two ultimately

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.920
can't make it work,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.920
then I hope

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.610
it won't affect you too much.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.920
You can still focus on your work.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.280
We can work together

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.540
and make a lot of money.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.280
1 million, 2 million, 5 million.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.510
It's all possible.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.730
I'm going to Canada later this year.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.730
I heard the down there is excellent.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.280
If you'd like,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.500
we could go together.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.060
I'll book two tickets,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.810
first class.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.900
That way the journey won't be tiring.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.190
And my English isn't good.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.300
You could help translate for me
when we're there.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.360
You'd be a big help.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.030
Alright, I've said
everything I wanted to say.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.230
You should go in now.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:35.770
Okay.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.200
I'll go in and sing for a while.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.180
I need to use the bathroom.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.750
Go ahead.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.850
Beichuan.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.920
Yin?

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.810
What are you doing here?

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.620
I stabbed Yan Jun.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.910
What did you say?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.990
I stabbed Yan Jun.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.720
I've settled the score.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.250
You stabbed

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.330
Yan Jun?

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:03.720
Hello?

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.130
Is this the police?

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.440
Yan Jun.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.590
Yan Jun!

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.530
Are you okay?

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.780
Call an ambulance quickly!

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.800
What's happening here?

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.410
Ye Xining,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.930
go get an ambulance quickly!

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.860
Are you alright?

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.070
Wait, where are you hurt?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.870
Hang in there!

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.800
He's been stabbed.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.130
Go get an ambulance now!

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.470
Has anyone called the police?

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.800
Um, how do I call for one?

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.010
Find a public phone
or ask someone for help.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.840
Hurry and get an ambulance!

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.230
Go!

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.710
Okay.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.320
Are you okay?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.550
Help!

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:33.590
Hang in there!

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:33.920
Help!

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.800
Please hold on.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.630
[One week later, Inpatient Department]

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.460
What bad luck.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.540
I should have listened to you.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.930
I never thought this guy
would be so vicious.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.290
Left me with a huge hole.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.810
Well. You were behind this, weren't you?

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.840
I haven't even had my stitches removed.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.500
How could you be so heartless?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.900
Yan Jun.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.570
This is heaven teaching you a lesson.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.500
I hope in the future

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.900
you can be
a businessman with a conscience.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.420
From now on, every week...

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.050
I mean, every month.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.800
I'll donate money to the orphanage.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.600
You'll help me with this, right?

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:30.440
Mr. Yan.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.190
Mr. Yan.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.150
Mr. Lu.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:32.860
Xining.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.930
You look well.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.030
We've all been worried about you.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.230
Seeing you recover so well

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.490
puts our minds at ease.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.320
This is what they call

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.410
surviving a great disaster

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.210
brings good fortune afterward.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.090
I came by car.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.280
Let me give everyone a ride.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:48.980
Mr. Lu.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.190
I'll take my bike.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.230
You go ahead then.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.160
Alright.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.330
Leave him to me.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.140
Goodbye.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.760
Take it slow!

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.890
Xiang Beichuan.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.110
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.990
Fine.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.460
If you have nothing to say to me,

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.060
I have something to tell you.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.890
About what happened

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.570
a year ago with the switch,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.960
I owe you a thank you.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.330
Thank you.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.420
It's all in the past.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.190
I hope you'll

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.420
be well in the future.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.840
You too.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.050
I never thought

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.670
that the laughter among our old friends

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.630
would be so short-lived.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.170
Yin's stabbing

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.130
also exposed
all of Yan Jun's past misdeeds.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.720
He was convicted of bribing officials,

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.750
lost everything,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.350
and sentenced to several years in prison.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.070
Oh my god.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.330
Why are you here?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.440
Why do you look so exhausted?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.590
I need to rest for a bit.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:40.570
Oh my!

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.960
What's going on?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.590
Ye Xining

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.070
just called me

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.960
and asked if I'm free tomorrow

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.280
to take her to the airport.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.810
I asked where she was going,

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.630
and she said back to Hungary.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.300
I asked when she'd be back,

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.440
and she said not anytime soon.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.510
Oh, right.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.130
She left you a twin-tub washing machine

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.250
because your partition room is damp

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.550
and clothes won't dry properly.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.130
I just went to get it for you.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.630
As I understand it,

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.890
the twin-tub washing machine

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.670
has one tub on the left

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.130
and one on the right.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.760
The left one washes

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.070
and the right one spins dry.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.870
The spin dryer is quite special.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.690
You've never heard that sound, have you?

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:22.440
No.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.070
When that spin dryer starts,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.960
it's extremely loud.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.230
Very noisy.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.390
So it's settled.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.550
You'll come to my place
to do laundry at night,

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.320
and if I get hungry,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.120
I'll come over for some noodles.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.800
The one on the left

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.190
is for washing.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.480
The one on the right

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.410
is for spinning.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.060
My mom has one of these.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.440
I must say this thing works really well.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.120
It only has one drawback.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.010
It's too noisy.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.760
Once it starts spinning,

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.350
it just keeps going.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.410
It's so noisy here.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.270
Where are you going?

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.590
You stay here.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.340
I need to go out for a while.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.890
Why are you here?

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.320
I'm here to do laundry.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.230
Laundry?

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.640
Don't you have a washing machine here?

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.600
Sheng Yahui

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.110
already sent the washing machine
to your place.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.170
I didn't know that.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.130
What do you really want to talk about?

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.880
Can you please stay?

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.380
Why should I?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.200
I don't want you to leave.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.300
The flight tickets are already booked.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.700
Tickets can be refunded.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.710
If that doesn't work,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.740
I'll pay you back the difference.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.880
Do you think we're right for each other?

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.120
Yes.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.360
I don't think so.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.690
You wouldn't be able to handle

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.110
someone with my personality.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:51.920
It's okay.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360
I can improve.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.190
I can learn.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:58.550
I can adapt to you.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:59.600
Xiang Beichuan,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.280
you can't do it.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.600
You're just not the type
who can put up with me.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.000
Why don't we give it a try?

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.690
We've been trying for so long.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.370
I don't want to change myself.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.420
What you like

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.480
is who I used to be.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.340

and who you are now

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.360
