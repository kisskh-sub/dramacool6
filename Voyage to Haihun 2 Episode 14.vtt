(Jingkou Village)

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.580
Why am I sleeping in bed?

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.350
You sleepwalked.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.720
I sleepwalked?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.040
Yeah.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.510
Where did you sleep last night?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.300
Sorry about that.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.710
Are you hungry?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.120
No.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.060
Want to eat something?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.120
Heng.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.150
What are you doing?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.680
I'm changing clothes.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.850
I'm a man, too.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.240
What do you want so early?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.430
I came to check on you.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.710
Don't come in.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.280
What's wrong? Let me in so we can talk.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.270
I'm not done changing.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.700
What? Is there a lady inside?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.750
No.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.990
Don't ruin my reputation.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.840
Then open the door.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm not done changing.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.870
How was it last night?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.960
Was it handled properly?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840
Listen to me.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.470
The key is not to hurt the lady's heart.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.750
Be honest

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.360
with your feelings.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.400
Sincerity always matters most.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.560
- You...
- Wait for me at the bridge.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.000
I'll go find you after changing.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.880
Not going.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.940
I'm here to guide and teach you.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.890
I know your heart's long been
with my senior.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.710
Stop hiding your feelings.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.870
It's been over ten years.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.000
Can you be a little braver?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.040
Yes, my senior

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.140
may look rather stern,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.290
but she's truly gentle inside.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.400
The sacred herb is too potent.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.570
It's making me hallucinate again.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.080
Earth Rank family, come here.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.270
Come here.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.900
I must go call my senior.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.150
I'll take a look, too.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.200
I'm coming as well.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.960
I'm coming, too.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.750
Family.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.180
Family.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.120
Hear me out.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.950
Please set your mind at ease.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.910
These gold biscuits

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.360
will be delivered safely to your family.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.050
We will tell them

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.510
you are doing well here.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.760
- Great.
- Good.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.770
Trust us.
Every effort will be remembered.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.960
Everyone will receive blessings.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.760
Thanks to Mistress.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.700
Always at Mistress's service.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.510
Hey.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.470
What?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.570
Check that chest.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.040
- Me again?
- Yes.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.950
Fine.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.120
Come on, family!

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.350
- Keep up.
- Keep up.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.530
It was my fault last night.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.270
De Jiu did the right thing.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.120
Though I passed out,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.610
I did wake up later.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.540
I acted so willfully and recklessly.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.950
I hope it didn't trouble you and De Jiu.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.940
I feel so guilty about it.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880
No need, really.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.620
This tea is quite good.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.560
- De Jiu.
- Wait.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.350
Allow me.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.720
Such fine tea.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.120
You two have

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.560
important matters to discuss.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.920
I shouldn't stay.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.630
I'll take my leave now.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.400
There's nothing between me and her.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.720
She just came to offer an apology.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.230
An apology.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.750
Oh.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.750
I saw it.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.920
Any leads?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.870
They took the gold out for a stroll,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.410
found a hidden spot,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.840
and burned the cloth with the tags.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.940
Then, they brought it back.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.720
Using the gold over and over.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.880
No wonder they give it away so freely.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.610
Seems I must reveal the truth to all.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.870
The Marquis and I will help you.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.710
Alright.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.200
It's getting late.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.700
You must be tired today.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.070
Get some rest early.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.600
Tonight, you must sleep on the bed.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.920
I'll turn in first.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.410
Greetings, family.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.290
Greetings, family.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.340
Greetings, family.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.510
Greetings, family.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.900
Greetings, family.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.700
Horse Wang, you've been deceived.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.080
The gold

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.040
never reached your family.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.140
They haul the gold out
and then bring it back,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.030
using it over and over.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.270
All to trick you into working.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.120
Wang,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.010
you can't speak so recklessly.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.360
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.550
Enough, Wang, stop talking.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.730
Have you ever met Mistress?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.160
Where would they get so much gold?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.260
Have you thought about that?

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.980
Has your family truly received the gold?

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.040
Have you ever gotten a reply from them?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.190
Alright, enough.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.880
As long as we work hard,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.480
we'll earn the gold,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.240
secure a place,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.560
and receive Mistress's blessing.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.730
- Did you note it down?
- Yeah.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.890
Make sure to note it down.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.060
Why call yourself Horse Wang?

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.370
You should be called Donkey Wang.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.520
A stubborn donkey.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.230
Greetings, family.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.290
A good harvest today.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.130
Yeah.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.150
Greetings, family.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.940
Family, greetings.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.120
Greetings, Heaven Rank family.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.360
Wish you joy today.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.610
Sir.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.750
You've been deceived.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.610
Those gold biscuits

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.630
never reached your family.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.720
They carted the gold away
and brought it back again

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.030
just to trick you into working here.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.330
Impossible.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.270
Greetings, family.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.870
Greetings, Heaven Rank family.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.130
May your day be filled with joy.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.320
Sir.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.510
We've been deceived.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.350
The gold

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.230
never reached our family.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.440
What?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.720
How dare you slander Mistress!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.160
This man,

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.480
though of Heaven Rank,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.600
dares

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.250
to openly defame Mistress,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.760
claiming the gold meant for us
never reached our family

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.870
and was taken back instead.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.730
Utter nonsense.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.870
May you meet a grim end.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.750
Utter nonsense.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.600
- A grim end to you.
- A grim end to you.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.440
Look.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.120
They move the gold out

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.220
and then destroy the bags and addresses.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.670
After that, they bring the gold back.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.600
This is just a trick to deceive you.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.240
Fake, all fake.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.280
It must be fake.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.840
Fake.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.800
You're lying.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.600
Family, listen to me.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.820
This is a misunderstanding.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.200
This here is Wang.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.670
He's new here.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.870
He must've heard these rumors somewhere.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.290
You shouldn't speak recklessly.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.750
Actually, Wang

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.080
is a man with a kind heart.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.870
What he did was for our sake.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.320
Right?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.480
Family, don't get angry.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.650
Let's not spoil the harmony.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.820
Alright, you may leave.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.100
Next time, don't say that.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.580
Don't say that next time.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.620
Let's not spoil the harmony.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.320
Sorry about that.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.670
Making such a joke.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.590
Unbelievable.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.750
Wang.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.120
You mustn't talk nonsense
like this again.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.630
You...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.320
If we work diligently,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.080
we'll live better days.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.860
Mistress will bless us.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.210
They believe
only what they want to believe.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.240
Mental manipulation.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.510
Even more dreadful than Mishenfu.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.820
What does that mean?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.010
It must be an even stronger drug.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.720
It feeds on unrealistic wishes

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.240
to take hold of one's mind.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.270
If that's the case...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.510
Though wishes are but illusions,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.020
the sacred herb is real.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.940
If we destroy the sacred herb,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.440
wouldn't that shatter
their foolish obsession?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.090
If they fail their task,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.160
they'll be driven out of the village.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.360
Destroying the sacred herb
will draw Mistress out.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.420
It's easy to ruin the sacred herb.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.360
It fears water.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.860
Let's act in the middle of the night.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.530
We must be careful.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.240
If they see us,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.550
the villagers will go mad.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.560
Be careful.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.560
The sacred herb is all gone?

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.010
The sacred herb is all gone!

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.260
All our efforts are wasted.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.550
Everything's for nothing now.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.390
Horse Wang.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.160
Why did you treat me this way?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.630
This...

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.340
I understand now.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.260
This is a trial.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.050
A trial of my will.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.840
I can't give in.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.030
I must hold on.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.500
I must push through.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.510
There's still time.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.230
I'll head down to gather
the sacred herb.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.700
I can still make it
before tomorrow's ceremony.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.890
Forty dan.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.440
However hard you work tonight,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.750
you still wouldn't finish it all.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.640
There's time; I'll make it in time.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.910
Why push yourself so hard?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.340
I'm not doing this just for myself.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.670
It's for my brother, Scalp Wang.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.960
When he first came to Yuzhang,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.000
he refused Mistress's blessing

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.080
and left me.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.550
He turned to banditry.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.670
He even dared to defy Mistress,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.080
bringing harm to the land.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.390
His sins are grave.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.910
I'm working so hard now

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.790
to atone for his wrongs.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.510
If I can do that,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.960
both of us

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.790
might find peace in the next life.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.850
So close.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm so close.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.420
Why treat me this way?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.600
I'm running out of time.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.720
This is my only chance

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.510
to receive Mistress's blessing.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.920
I'm so close

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.440
to having a blissful afterlife.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.030
Mortals have no afterlife.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.200
A mortal lives but one life.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.580
And that is the life you have now.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.350
Horse Wang.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.820
Leave the village.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.800
Go live your present life, will you?

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.520
What are you saying?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.030
My present life?

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.160
Why do you think I yearn
for a happy afterlife?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.050
Because this life
has been full of hardship.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.750
I've suffered enough.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.170
You tell me to live in my present life,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.600
but what life do I have left?

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.680
I've lost even the hope
for an afterlife.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.800
You two...

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.310
You destroyed the sacred herb.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.040
You carry heavy sins.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.490
You're bound for the underworld.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.320
Maybe...

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.030
If I kill you all,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.360
will that redeem me?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.040
Horse Wang, snap out of it.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.210
Yes.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.570
Yes.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.640
I'll end you.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.770
Only by ending you can I atone.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.160
I'll end you.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.080
Then my next life will be blessed.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.600
Yes.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.830
I will end you all.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.270
I will end you.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.060
Seize them.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.300
They destroyed the sacred herb.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.260
Hurry, seize them.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.110
Go.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.010
After them.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.130
Quick, seize them.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.900
- Wang!
- Stop.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.690
- Don't run!
- Don't let them get away.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.620
Don't run.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.690
- Seize them!
- Stop!

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.430
- Seize them!
- Stop!

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.390
We can't go any further.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.590
The Sacred Land is just ahead.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.310
If they go in,
they'll face Heaven's wrath.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.440
We must not enter.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.660
Yes, they'll be punished by Heaven.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.320
De Jiu!

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.600
Is this the Sacred Land's
mysterious power?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.080
Careful.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.080
Wang.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.910
Are they specters?

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.510
Don't be afraid.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.280
It's just miasma all around.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.980
Or maybe just a trick of the light.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.710
Let's find De Jiu.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.040
De Jiu.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.630
De Jiu.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.940
Isn't this where the ghosts just passed?

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.550
That way.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.230
Strange.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.900
We can't get out of this fog.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.600
Why don't we wait till dawn?

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.610
The mist will clear then.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.270
I'm worried they might be in danger.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.840
Wang.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.160
If we keep going in circles,
we'll just wear ourselves out.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.480
Don't worry.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.920
Qi and De Jiu will be fine.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.020
Those villagers have lost their senses.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.830
No one knows what they might do.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.320
Why must you oppose Mistress?

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.020
From what I see,
the villagers are all willing.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.880
Since they choose to stay,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.550
it means they feel content here.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.590
They've been deceived by false promises.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.990
Mortals can only live
in the present moment.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.660
There's no such thing as the next life.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.520
But in times like these,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.550
where can they find contentment?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.840
I don't know where,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.790
but I know happiness
can't be built on lies.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.830
I believe it's right here with Mistress.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.480
Lan'er, Mistress is not what she seems.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.720
Your parents are the real ones.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.030
Don't give up.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.880
You will find your parents for sure.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.550
Until that day comes,

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.850
stay with us.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.200
We will look after you.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.230
Thank you, Wang...

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.910
Lan'er.
