00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.080
Thank you for supporting me,
Third Granduncle.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.359
Even if I die, I will make sure
the Pei family has a worthy head.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.278
Fate can be cruel.

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.359
Pei Yuze!

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.359
Jiang Yao, what do you want now?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.838
Pei Yuze, you're despicable!

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:26.720
You waited until now to make your move
and snatch the position from me!

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.078
You made me a laughingstock!

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.159
That calm, indifferent act you put on

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.640
all this time was all a disguise.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.078
It's all because of you
that my big plan was ruined!

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.038
My five years of hard work wasted!

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.358
Yao, don't do this.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.719
It's not over yet.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.599
I still have a way!

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.879
Let me go!

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.879
Pei Yuze is the head of the family now.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.119
What else can I do?

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.479
Yao,

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.118
he's been poisoned.

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.999
He has at most a month left.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.558
You don't have to worry.

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.199
How do you know he was poisoned?

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.439
Because I was the one who did it.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.800
What? You did it?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.720
Yao, we just need him to die
before he officially takes over.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.479
I have ways to convince the elders

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120
to reinstate you as head.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.038
But Pei Yuze is
at the Lian Residence now.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.719
He's heavily guarded.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.278
How do we get to him?

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.799
I already have a plan for that.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.920
I only need your cooperation.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.598
Yao,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.439
I committed patricide for you.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.080
There's no turning back now.

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.479
This time, we must succeed.

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.118
Xueshan, don't worry.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.159
You've done so much for me
over the years.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.720
I won't let you down.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.200
Xinruo, help me.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680
All done.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.559
Thank you, Xinruo.

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.599
How did you get hurt so badly?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.440
It was Pei Xueshan.
She tried to kill me.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.399
Why would she do such a thing?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.159
She wanted me to side with the Japanese

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.720
and poison Pei Yuze.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.078
I haven't lost my mind to that extent.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.358
When she couldn't convince me,

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.839
she decided to silence me.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.199
What exactly is she plotting?

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.078
I don't know.

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.599
All I know is that a few Japanese
are under her command.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.879
She refuses to tell me anything else.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.160
So what's your next move?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.120
What else can I do?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.880
I have nothing left here.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.278
I'm leaving Hu City

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.719
and starting over.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.999
Get some rest.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.040
Don't worry. Once he's better,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.360
I'll make him leave.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.540
(Many days later)

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.239
Xinruo.

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:01.200
Have some breakfast.

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:03.318
You're recovering.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.039
Why aren't you resting?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.280
I've been troubling you all these days.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.679
I plan to leave Hu City today.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.760
Before I go,
I want to say a proper goodbye.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.960
(Is Jiang Yao really leaving?)

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.520
I have nothing left now.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.360
I might as well
start fresh somewhere new.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.800
Pei Yuze, what happened
between us was my fault.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.759
You're the family head now.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.520
We're even.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.880
Leave the past in the past.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
Have a seat.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.038
You always loved
my eight-treasure porridge.

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.919
I wanted to make it
for you one last time.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.240
But I don't have enough ingredients.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.959
Mr. Pei, sorry,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.240
there's none for you.

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.399
It's all right. I don't like sweets.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.358
I haven't had this in years.

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:03.399
I almost forgot what it tasted like.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.320
Eat up.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.680
Pei Yuze, do you really think
I'd ever hurt Xinruo?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.200
Before lighting the poison incense,

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.719
find a way to get Lian Xinruo
to take the antidote

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.079
to ensure your and her safety.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:13.759
How does it taste?

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.799
Just like I remembered.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.560
When are you leaving?

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:23.959
I want to pay respects to Mr. Lian
before I leave.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.460
(Tablets of Beloved Father Lian Chen
and Beloved Mother Shuhua)

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:54.799
Yuze!

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.880
Xinruo!

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.919
- Xinruo!
- Xinruo!

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.640
I'm so cold...

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.520
My chest hurts...

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.639
What's wrong?

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.679
Was I poisoned?

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.359
How could this be?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.360
Why would Xinruo be the one poisoned?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.559
Jiang Yao,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.640
why would you hurt Xinruo?

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:48.999
No! It wasn't me! I would never!

00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:57.319
Xinruo? Xinruo!

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.100
(Pei Residence)

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.358
Pei Xueshan, where are you?

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:05.919
Pei Xueshan, get out here!

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.079
Pei Xueshan, why did you lie to me?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.240
Mr. Jiang.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.278
Where's Pei Xueshan?

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.679
Where is she?

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:15.678
She went out last night
and hasn't come back.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.198
Get out! Pei Xueshan, show yourself!

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:20.399
Pei Xueshan, get out here!

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.400
Give me the antidote.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:26.758
I don't have it.

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.879
Pei Xueshan lied to me.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.838
I gave Xinruo the antidote.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.239
I don't know why she was poisoned.

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.639
You idiot.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.678
You better pray I find the antidote.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.239
Or I'll skin you alive!

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.199
Wen Yuan.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.560
(Pei Family Ancestral Hall)
Stop! Don't run!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.640
Jiang Yao, you can't escape.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.519
If you're a man,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.720
come out and take responsibility.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.200
He's gone.

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.199
How could this happen?

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:28.720
There must be a secret passage
in the ancestral hall.

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:29.719
Go find it.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.919
And seal off all information.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.439
No word of this can get out.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440
Understood.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.080
I'm sorry.

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.199
I was careless.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:20.399
This isn't your fault.

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.999
You were poisoned because you inhaled

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.560
that poison incense earlier.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.400
I just wish
I'd known how much you suffered sooner.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:34.679
All these years must have been hard.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.040
I'd rather endure double the pain

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.720
than watch you suffer.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.400
Yuze.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.000
I'm not scared at all.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.679
If you hadn't saved me five years ago,

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.679
I wouldn't be alive today.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.719
Even if we don't find the antidote,

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:06.839
dying together wouldn't be

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.480
something I regret.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.239
I won't let you die.

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:45.759
I believe in you.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.760
Jiang Yao inhaled the poison incense
but wasn't poisoned,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.640
which means
he must have taken the antidote.

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.119
Pei Xueshan lied when she said

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.280
there was no antidote.

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:07.599
You're right.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.840
As long as we find Pei Xueshan,

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.039
we still have a chance.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.760
Why can't

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.039
I find her?

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:35.159
Why?

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:38.199
It's all fake.

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:40.119
They've been using me.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:41.599
It's all a lie!

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:47.719
Xinruo,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.200
I didn't mean to...

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.600
If you die,

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.119
I'll die with you.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.639
Pei Yuze.

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.959
This is all his fault.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:09.959
He must die.

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.399
He must!
