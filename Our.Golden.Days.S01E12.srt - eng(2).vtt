00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:03.645
(Episode 12)

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:14.725
What was that, Eun Oh?

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:23.405
What are you doing?

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:26.705
Why did you...

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.975
pick up my stuff then put it down again?

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.915
I put it back because it wasn't mine.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.315
You're so nasty.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.245
Don't look at it,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.255
but if you did, put it on the table.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:43.225
I'm sorry for peeking without permission.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.725
So you were going to go out and pretend to come back in?

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:55.935
Do you have to show that you notice everything?

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:59.205
Clean up so I can open the cafe.

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:00.775
Wait.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.805
Why did you come straight here?

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:07.645
Shouldn't you be at your Mapo site?

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:10.145
That site's closed for the day.

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.585
Why? Did something go wrong?

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:15.785
The head engineer's mother-in-law passed away,

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:16.925
and the burial is scheduled for today.

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:19.695
We'll do everything with the electric wiring tomorrow.

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:21.995
You can do that?

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:23.965
What are they working on?

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:27.235
You talk too much for someone...

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:28.805
who just woke up in the cafe.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.135
I was up until 7am. When did I fall asleep?

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:44.315
You shouldn't have let her know you were working at the cafe.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.815
How dare you doze off out there?

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:01.265
Here you are.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:04.105
What's that noise?

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.405
Something hard to believe.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.645
(Men's Restroom)

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:17.545
Ji Hyuk, is it a special day?

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:19.855
I'm pitching to investors today.

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.185
I see.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:24.755
Thanks for wishing me luck.

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.495
Was he always that thick-faced?

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:34.995
He was like that sometimes.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:37.865
The restroom.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.315
It's completely dry.

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:48.845
It is.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:51.585
We thought he showered at a sauna.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.885
Was he trying this hard to save money?

00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:58.085
I wondered why our water bill had gone up.

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:02.225
Goodness.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.765
You're a bit surprised, aren't you?

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:08.135
Yes.

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:12.405
I think I misunderstood him in a way.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:14.735
How so?

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:32.355
As you can see, from 2020 to 2025,

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.495
DIY interior design was gradually on the rise.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.595
There are just two reasons for that.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:42.835
Cost and individuality.

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:45.935
It's cheaper than using turnkey interior design services.

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:48.975
In return, you must do all the work.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:51.105
You can decorate your space...

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.445
as you want, without anyone's interference.

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:55.815
However, there's a problem with that.

00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:59.155
Doing your own interior design takes research.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:01.385
But however hard you study,

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.525
your work won't be as meticulous as an expert's.

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.025
Here's an example.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.425
Cost and individuality.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:12.135
Millennial and Gen Z designers value both,

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.435
yet they struggle to find work in the failing economy.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.765
A new job as a coordinator...

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:19.635
overseeing the DIY interior process...

00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:21.675
is an alluring opportunity for all of them.

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:22.805
(Mamdaerozip)

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:25.715
Mamdaerozip connects consumers and providers,

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:28.175
improving the outcome of your DIY interior project.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.445
As you can see,

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.885
it's the first matching platform...

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:34.315
that lets you do whatever you want with your space.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.285
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:39.655
Yes.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.025
You found it?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.365
Thanks.

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:48.165
You don't need to know.

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:54.105
Oh, really?

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:56.405
When is that?

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:01.715
How did...

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.095
Where are you going?

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.495
The first client wants to see me.

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.325
It looks like things didn't go well for Ji Hyuk.

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:23.835
Your first try rarely works out when you have no experience.

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:36.785
(Coordinator Inquiries)

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.455
Who is this person?

00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:41.155
Why do they keep posting?

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:45.925
How come you always come together?

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.225
My Yeong Ra won't do as she's told.

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:52.335
I told her to take a friend, but she cares too much about me.

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.735
Youngyu Construction's chairman's wife was here,

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:58.335
and she envied you when I told her about you.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:01.175
Oh, she doesn't have a daughter, does she?

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:02.945
Just three sons, right?

00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:09.985
The key's in the car.

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:13.785
Bye.

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:16.455
Drive her safely.

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:17.825
Sure.

00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:29.435
The door. Open it.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:54.425
Yeong Ra. Why don't you eat lunch with your mother?

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:57.695
Because I brought a packed lunch.

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:01.165
But it's 12:10pm right now.

00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:03.705
You and your mom got a massage together,

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:06.075
and it ended at lunchtime. Shouldn't you eat together?

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.775
- You must eat your packed lunch? - Yes.

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:10.745
Why?

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:12.575
Because I brought it with me.

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:14.375
Yes, that packed lunch too.

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:17.245
Why do you always bring packed lunch and dinner?

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:20.755
If it's to avoid your stalker,

00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:22.385
I'll escort you.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:23.655
Let's eat out.

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:26.495
No. I always eat a packed lunch.

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.425
Always, every day?

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:30.665
Yes.

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:32.665
To watch my health.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.635
Do you have some kind of illness?

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.905
No. I'm perfectly healthy.

00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:43.745
Then it's even weirder.

00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:45.205
What must you watch...

00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:46.845
that you don't even eat out with your mom?

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:51.215
I guess my mom had lunch plans.

00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:53.315
You don't know for sure?

00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:58.355
She isn't obligated to tell me everything.

00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:03.265
Do you eat your packed lunch when you meet friends too?

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:07.365
You must eat out with them.

00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:09.835
I don't see my friends.

00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:12.375
Why not? You don't have any?

00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:14.675
I lost them all.

00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:15.745
Your friends?

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:17.805
How is that possible?

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:22.175
Not everyone needs friends.

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:24.745
I see.

00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:27.755
When you said the definition of a friend differed,

00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:29.585
did you mean you had none?

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:34.925
You become unproductive when you're with friends.

00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.225
You eat and talk about nonsense.

00:08:38.295 --> 00:08:39.295
Goodness.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.935
Park Yeong Ra. Have you ever been to a club?

00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:47.535
Why would I go there?

00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:50.575
Have you been to an amusement park with a friend?

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:52.475
I went with my parents.

00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:53.745
What about the Jarasum Festival?

00:08:54.745 --> 00:08:56.085
Why would I go there?

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:57.715
Have you been to a concert or a musical?

00:08:57.945 --> 00:08:59.015
I go with my mom.

00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:00.985
Have you seen the Yeouido fireworks?

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:02.185
The Hangang Park?

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:03.355
What about Seongsu-dong?

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.855
Have you ever played a claw machine?

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:05.955
Have you tried coin karaoke?

00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:08.355
Did you take sticker photos with your friends?

00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:09.725
Ever been to Hongdae?

00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:11.295
You've been to an escape room, right?

00:09:11.465 --> 00:09:12.535
What about a board game cafe?

00:09:14.995 --> 00:09:17.465
I get it. You haven't been to or done any of that.

00:09:20.175 --> 00:09:22.845
My gosh. What kind of life is that?

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:24.845
What is it like?

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:34.355
Sorry. I'll stop asking questions.

00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:43.425
From what I heard,

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.935
you chose the gallery to host the exhibition.

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:47.365
Yes.

00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:49.435
I owe it to you.

00:09:49.535 --> 00:09:52.535
I only gave you a few suggestions.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.445
The director of that gallery doesn't host just anyone.

00:09:56.905 --> 00:09:57.945
Good for you.

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:00.715
I'll do anything for my daughter.

00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:04.385
I guess you asked to see me about her, then.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:05.785
What is it?

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:08.215
Well...

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:11.155
There's a list of VIPs...

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:13.025
I'd like to invite to Yeong Ra's exhibition.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.025
It's just a wish list of mine.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.295
Do you think...

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:23.535
you could go over it for me?

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:27.835
(VIP Guest List)

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:29.205
Could you tell me...

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:32.675
which of those people are interested in art?

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:36.115
You're really something, Madam Ko.

00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:39.215
It looks like this is a list of people...

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.115
you want to invite,

00:10:42.315 --> 00:10:45.055
and you want me to contact them for you.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:50.525
That just shows how much I trust you.

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.895
You're such a sweet-talker.

00:10:56.565 --> 00:11:00.005
Do you think you could help?

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.815
(Interpreting "Innate Rhythm of Rose")

00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:32.575
What can I do?

00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:34.405
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:11:35.735 --> 00:11:36.775
Actually,

00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:39.215
I saw this kitchen photo ten days ago,

00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:41.845
but I hesitated because it would cost a lot.

00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:44.185
I will live in this house for at least ten years, after all.

00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:46.215
The kitchen is important, you know.

00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:51.585
So, are you saying you want to replace the countertop...

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:54.955
and change the cupboard to this style?

00:11:55.895 --> 00:11:59.135
But that would cost a fortune.

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:01.895
You know the kitchen furniture is already in production, right?

00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:03.065
I know.

00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:05.735
My husband said he'd divorce me if I didn't change them.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:08.005
What?

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:10.605
Every night, I kept saying,

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.475
"I should've done this."

00:12:12.475 --> 00:12:14.045
I complained while lying in bed.

00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:16.315
He doesn't want to hear it for ten years.

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:18.485
I'm regretting my choice now.

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:22.255
If you are willing to pay the cost,

00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:23.685
I can do that for you.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.125
But what about moving?

00:12:25.185 --> 00:12:26.925
We can keep our stuff in storage...

00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:28.625
and stay at my parents' house.

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:32.295
Okay. I get it.

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.735
Please send me the kitchen sketch you made.

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.835
I will make a drawing.

00:12:38.535 --> 00:12:41.035
I'm so sorry, and thank you.

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:43.675
At first, I thought it would be okay...

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:45.705
to just go with something cheaper since it was new,

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:48.815
but I realised that I'd regret it for at least ten years,

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:50.715
so I decided to change it.

00:12:51.315 --> 00:12:52.445
You're right.

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:55.585
The kitchen is an important space in the house.

00:12:57.455 --> 00:13:00.195
It's a DIY interior design, but the details are exquisite.

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:01.325
I know, right?

00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:03.465
These are the photos of my house under construction.

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:05.495
The coordinator is absolutely amazing.

00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:07.595
You were lucky to meet a good coordinator,

00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:09.205
but that's the company's policy.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.335
That's true.

00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:12.775
The CEO also has a really great mindset.

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.135
(The coordinator is absolutely amazing.)

00:13:16.175 --> 00:13:17.945
Eun Oh did a great job.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.615
I need you for my first client.

00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:27.085
I'll pay 20,000 dollars.

00:13:27.885 --> 00:13:29.385
You're offering 20,000?

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:33.525
The results of the pitching presentation...

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:35.325
will be decided within 3 to 4 days, or no later than a week.

00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:38.625
They said the angel investment could be decided on the same day.

00:13:43.435 --> 00:13:45.635
It will work.

00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:48.575
Instead of taking out a secured car loan,

00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:51.775
I'll get an investment and pay her with my money.

00:13:57.315 --> 00:13:58.715
Who is it?

00:14:01.885 --> 00:14:04.085
We have an issue regarding our first client.

00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:05.725
Please come in.

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:07.255
No, it's simple.

00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:10.995
The client wants to replace all the kitchen furniture.

00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:12.325
From the design to the materials.

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:15.665
That will delay the construction schedule.

00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:18.535
It will take at least a week.

00:14:19.135 --> 00:14:20.975
She said she'd cover all the existing furniture costs.

00:14:20.975 --> 00:14:22.605
She also said she could even put off the move.

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:24.405
Does it work for you?

00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:26.015
Yes.

00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:28.515
I have some previous designs,

00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:29.745
so it'll just require a little more work.

00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:33.755
Then, we will have to add the design fee.

00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:36.155
You take care of it.

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:39.255
All right.

00:14:43.765 --> 00:14:44.825
A week?

00:14:47.265 --> 00:14:49.195
Why is everything going so smoothly?

00:14:58.875 --> 00:14:59.915
Welcome.

00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:01.015
Hi.

00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:03.185
Where is Mamdaerozip's office?

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:04.715
Well...

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:06.615
Over there.

00:15:13.995 --> 00:15:15.895
You know Hyunmyeong Apartment, right?

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:17.265
It is currently under construction.

00:15:17.595 --> 00:15:19.095
We are the representatives...

00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:22.335
of Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 of Hyunmyeong Apartment.

00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:24.765
I see.

00:15:26.535 --> 00:15:30.045
By the way, the office is quite small.

00:15:30.845 --> 00:15:32.715
We can have a group meeting at the cafe.

00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:33.915
Let's go out.

00:15:34.345 --> 00:15:35.845
Don't you know what group buying is?

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:37.845
I do.

00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:41.355
So, the people who are interested in DIY interior design...

00:15:41.355 --> 00:15:42.925
There are 29 households.

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.025
Only in Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:47.155
Are you sure we pay all the material and labour costs?

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.425
We also get to make choices.

00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:50.865
You can purchase the materials yourselves.

00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:52.735
We can just calculate the quantity you need.

00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:57.265
So, since this is like group buying,

00:15:57.265 --> 00:16:00.005
can you offer a discount on the coordinator fees?

00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:01.505
How about 30 percent?

00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:03.445
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.205
What? Listen.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:07.815
We have 29 households who are interested for now.

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:09.115
If things go well,

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:10.985
there will be many more.

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:13.155
Our apartment buildings are 38 years old.

00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:16.055
You shouldn't view coordinators' skills as a commodity.

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:18.425
They are all experts in the interior design industry.

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.225
How about 20 percent?

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.765
Not even one percent.

00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:26.335
If you don't want to pay the coordinators,

00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:27.795
you can do the interior design yourself.

00:16:27.795 --> 00:16:30.205
There are many DIY interior design communities.

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:31.305
I can tell you about them if you want.

00:16:31.835 --> 00:16:33.975
You know, group buying deals...

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:36.205
are supposed to be cheaper.

00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:39.145
Our apartment complex has 3,000 units.

00:16:39.175 --> 00:16:41.345
Let's just forget it. Let's go.

00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:44.145
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:47.115
You can take on 29 construction contracts at once.

00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:48.655
I'm not taking on construction contracts.

00:16:49.215 --> 00:16:50.925
I'm just matching you with coordinators.

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:52.485
What's the difference?

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:54.595
- Hey, who are these ladies? - Please, Mr. Lee.

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:57.095
I think he's being pushed around by them.

00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:00.365
I don't think that's the case.

00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:02.765
He's not the type to be pushed around easily.

00:17:04.905 --> 00:17:05.905
What?

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:24.025
You're a young CEO, but you're too inflexible.

00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:26.595
A new company that has just started is supposed...

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:28.555
to offer a discount for a project with 29 units.

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:31.425
I have my own principles.

00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.735
Will you stick to them even if we don't hire you?

00:17:34.265 --> 00:17:35.265
Yes.

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:38.005
That's enough. Give me that thing.

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:39.935
Here.

00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:42.705
Can we draw...

00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:45.275
what we want like this?

00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:46.645
Yes.

00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:50.185
The coordinator will create a floor plan for the construction.

00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:54.755
Then, when can you start?

00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:59.255
Will you sign the contract?

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:02.425
- Yes. - Yes.

00:18:04.965 --> 00:18:06.935
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:08.495
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:10.605
Bye.

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:21.415
- One iced Americano. - Okay.

00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:25.515
Ji Hyuk, what is group buying?

00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:29.085
A group of 29 households wants to hire our coordinators.

00:18:31.025 --> 00:18:33.925
It feels like the feisty Lee Ji Hyuk has made his comeback.

00:18:35.995 --> 00:18:38.065
Where's Eun Oh? Did she go home?

00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:40.965
She's cleaning the terrace.

00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:43.335
She's unbelievable.

00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:05.425
(Lee Myeong Hui)

00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:13.495
I'm sorry, Myeong Hui.

00:19:13.495 --> 00:19:15.195
I should've given you a call.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.035
The kids?

00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:21.635
Of course. I can do that now.

00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:23.005
It's been months.

00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:26.275
When do you want to meet?

00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:29.115
If the currents flowing in two parallel conductors...

00:19:29.115 --> 00:19:30.515
are in the same direction,

00:19:30.515 --> 00:19:31.685
they attract each other.

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.115
If they're in opposite directions...

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:37.155
Excuse me. Sir.

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:38.855
Could you please wake up the man next to you?

00:19:38.855 --> 00:19:41.095
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:43.395
Oh, dear.

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.225
This is an important part.

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.535
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep well last night.

00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:49.605
If they're in opposite directions,

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.605
which means in reciprocating conductors,

00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:52.905
a repulsive force will occur.

00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.975
I guess you are also working.

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:01.075
Yes.

00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:04.345
How many fathers here would come to the academy...

00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:05.985
without needing to work?

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:09.185
And we would end up failing in both.

(Owa Fire and Electrical Training Academy)

00:20:21.735 --> 00:20:23.265
I was out of my mind.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.465
How could I doze off in class?

00:20:26.135 --> 00:20:28.005
Can't I really handle this?

00:20:37.245 --> 00:20:38.945
Good for you, Sang Cheol.

00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:41.185
I thought you were trying too hard.

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:43.255
I'll study upstairs.

00:20:44.185 --> 00:20:45.255
Upstairs?

00:20:45.785 --> 00:20:47.195
In the room with a desk.

00:21:03.475 --> 00:21:04.545
What time is it?

00:21:05.745 --> 00:21:07.545
It's 1am already.

00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:10.185
Part-timers.

00:21:11.045 --> 00:21:12.045
What's that?

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:15.215
Who is looking for part-timers at this hour?

(DayBreak in Jaeha-dong is urgently hiring a part-timer.)

00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:24.465
A convenience store in Jaeha-dong?

00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:26.995
It's not in my neighbourhood.

00:21:27.595 --> 00:21:28.995
Only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?

00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:31.005
This is perfect for me.

and has been chosen for the investment.

00:21:53.323 --> 00:21:55.693
I made the cut.

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:01.463
Since I was given the opportunity, I should give my presentation.

00:22:01.463 --> 00:22:03.433
(2025 Sunny Investment Meet-up)

00:22:05.573 --> 00:22:07.303
(Mamdaerozip)

00:22:09.643 --> 00:22:11.613
(Sunny Investment Evaluator)

00:22:17.653 --> 00:22:19.223
(2025 Sunny Investment Meet-up)

00:22:19.223 --> 00:22:20.323
Hello.

00:22:21.283 --> 00:22:23.093
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk,

00:22:23.253 --> 00:22:25.193
the CEO of Mamdaerozip, a matching platform...

00:22:25.353 --> 00:22:26.593
that helps clients...

00:22:26.593 --> 00:22:28.623
design their own homes and achieve high-quality results.

00:22:30.093 --> 00:22:31.633
You will have four minutes to present your project...

00:22:31.633 --> 00:22:33.463
and five minutes for questions.

00:22:33.463 --> 00:22:36.103
The timer will go off once your time is up.

00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:37.933
Please begin when you're ready.

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:44.613
Thank you.

00:22:47.343 --> 00:22:50.313
When did you come up with this project?

00:22:51.813 --> 00:22:53.453
Does that even matter?

00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:56.253
I could say 3 or 5 years,

00:22:56.253 --> 00:22:58.053
but how would you know it's true?

00:22:58.793 --> 00:23:01.363
Besides, I don't believe that time equals depth.

00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:03.433
What motivated me is more important.

00:23:03.963 --> 00:23:06.733
Please share what motivated you, then.

00:23:13.273 --> 00:23:16.473
I stumbled on this idea by chance.

00:23:17.773 --> 00:23:19.913
I got a job at a construction site outside the city.

00:23:20.643 --> 00:23:22.543
While there, a newlywed couple asked...

00:23:22.543 --> 00:23:24.213
if I could help rescue their failed DIY interior project.

00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:27.053
That's how it all began.

00:23:27.753 --> 00:23:29.023
I realised many people...

00:23:29.293 --> 00:23:30.993
wanted to experience the joy...

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.123
of living in a house they designed themselves.

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.363
To me, it felt like endless possibilities.

00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:38.333
I was sure it would work.

00:23:50.113 --> 00:23:51.143
Ji Hyuk, wait.

00:23:55.283 --> 00:23:56.313
I bet I surprised you back there.

00:23:57.453 --> 00:23:58.983
Wasn't that your plan all along?

00:23:59.483 --> 00:24:02.053
I took a smart approach so I could invest in your business.

00:24:02.923 --> 00:24:04.523
I could have done it anonymously,

00:24:05.293 --> 00:24:07.993
but you'd be furious if you found out.

00:24:09.363 --> 00:24:10.433
So?

00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:13.733
I'll invest in Mamdaerozip.

00:24:14.863 --> 00:24:16.333
You didn't even discuss this with your team.

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:19.033
Angel investments can be made individually.

00:24:19.973 --> 00:24:21.043
I know that.

00:24:22.203 --> 00:24:24.073
- It's settled, then. - Not really.

00:24:25.873 --> 00:24:27.443
I won't accept your investment.

00:24:30.453 --> 00:24:31.753
Stop it already.

00:24:32.983 --> 00:24:34.623
You need investment to get a business off the ground.

00:24:35.153 --> 00:24:37.553
I looked at your website and have also seen you at work.

00:24:38.293 --> 00:24:39.493
I believe in its potential.

00:24:39.623 --> 00:24:41.263
Besides, it's not a big investment.

00:24:42.593 --> 00:24:43.893
Forget it, Seong Jae.

00:24:44.593 --> 00:24:47.803
I have already been offered an investment from Double S Startup.

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:49.333
Also, I said...

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:51.103
I wouldn't accept anyone's help.

00:24:52.633 --> 00:24:55.873
Are you kidding me? Why show up today...

00:24:56.073 --> 00:24:57.513
when you've already secured an investment?

00:24:57.843 --> 00:24:59.913
Because I promised I would pitch my business.

00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:02.213
I received the other offer just as I was about to go in.

00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:03.953
Their support is minimal, which means...

00:25:03.953 --> 00:25:05.253
you can also take an investment from me.

00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:06.853
All they're offering is 100,000 to 200,000 dollars.

00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:09.623
Double S Startup chose to invest in my project,

00:25:10.153 --> 00:25:11.293
and I want to make it on my own.

00:25:12.623 --> 00:25:13.963
Isn't that your pride talking?

00:25:14.593 --> 00:25:16.233
Why would you care about that when you run a business?

00:25:16.863 --> 00:25:17.893
I just do.

00:25:18.593 --> 00:25:19.963
Still, I'm grateful, Seong Jae.

00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:21.703
I appreciate the generous offer.

00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:26.603
This isn't because of Eun Oh.

00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:30.643
Ji Hyuk, I took the time to study your website.

00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:32.413
On top of that, I'm your friend.

00:25:32.943 --> 00:25:36.553
I can see now that you really have something going on.

00:25:36.653 --> 00:25:40.023
Even if pride is driving your business,

00:25:40.583 --> 00:25:42.153
it still feels wrong not to help you.

00:25:42.923 --> 00:25:44.793
Are you telling me you don't care how I feel?

00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:47.893
I do care, which is why I'm grateful for the offer.

00:25:48.823 --> 00:25:50.333
But I won't compromise my principles...

00:25:50.933 --> 00:25:52.693
just to make you feel better.

00:25:57.833 --> 00:25:59.373
Good for you, Ji Hyuk.

00:26:00.903 --> 00:26:03.113
Let's have lunch. It'll treat you to something nice.

00:26:04.713 --> 00:26:06.013
I have plans, you know.

00:26:07.313 --> 00:26:08.343
With who?

00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:11.813
Someone who needs my advice.

00:26:12.513 --> 00:26:13.553
I'll get going.

00:26:17.353 --> 00:26:20.563
While I was gone, he became a man of mystery.

00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:55.223
Why did she ask to meet at a place like this?

00:26:55.563 --> 00:26:57.093
Why not just text me the restaurant's address?

00:26:58.493 --> 00:27:00.303
Parking is not allowed here.

00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:04.803
- What's this? - What?

00:27:05.603 --> 00:27:06.643
What do you mean?

00:27:08.203 --> 00:27:09.273
I mean...

00:27:10.743 --> 00:27:12.013
I've never seen you dressed like this before.

00:27:13.943 --> 00:27:15.483
I have plans after lunch.

00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:17.353
Let's go, Seong Jae.

00:27:17.853 --> 00:27:20.023
Hold on. Why are you suddenly linking arms with me?

00:27:20.153 --> 00:27:22.623
Why not? You even used to give me piggyback rides.

00:27:22.783 --> 00:27:24.093
Linking arms is no big deal...

00:27:24.223 --> 00:27:25.393
between us.

00:27:31.993 --> 00:27:34.203
Su Bin, what's this?

00:27:34.563 --> 00:27:35.563
Isn't this hilarious?

00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:37.803
Quail eggs are the babies, and the chicken egg is the mom.

00:27:38.003 --> 00:27:39.173
I bet you haven't seen anything like this before.

00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:41.773
It's a first.

00:27:46.683 --> 00:27:47.883
Enjoy, Seong Jae.

00:27:48.283 --> 00:27:50.713
No, you first. I'll get some on my own.

00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:52.683
Whenever I see you,

00:27:52.683 --> 00:27:54.823
I feel guilty for all the times I held out my hand...

00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:55.953
asking for snacks.

00:27:57.323 --> 00:27:59.293
- Out of the blue? - On top of that,

00:27:59.763 --> 00:28:01.623
you appeared on my YouTube channel.

00:28:01.793 --> 00:28:03.293
I shouldn't just thank you with my words.

00:28:03.593 --> 00:28:04.793
The least I can do is treat you to a meal.

00:28:04.993 --> 00:28:07.533
Is that why you asked to meet me? I thought it was to talk.

00:28:07.863 --> 00:28:09.733
What would I need to say to you?

00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:12.333
You wouldn't have shown up...

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.603
if I had offered to treat you to a meal.

00:28:14.073 --> 00:28:15.673
So I made up an excuse.

00:28:17.443 --> 00:28:20.113
Come on, you brat. I doubt you're in a position...

00:28:20.113 --> 00:28:21.913
to thank me over a meal.

00:28:22.113 --> 00:28:24.753
Besides, I'm not a stranger you asked for help.

00:28:25.153 --> 00:28:28.323
It's wrong to inconvenience even your own siblings.

00:28:30.293 --> 00:28:31.523
You sounded very grown-up.

00:28:32.823 --> 00:28:34.023
A grown-up is what I already am.

00:28:35.893 --> 00:28:38.663
Since you went to college in the US,

00:28:38.793 --> 00:28:40.063
you don't have...

00:28:40.063 --> 00:28:42.333
any fond food memories from your early to mid-20s.

00:28:43.503 --> 00:28:45.103
I guess not.

00:28:45.603 --> 00:28:47.643
Seong Jae, I bet you haven't heard of Gangster Tteokbokki.

00:28:48.573 --> 00:28:50.213
Have you even been to the Hongdae area?

00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:51.213
What about Seongsu-dong?

00:29:01.123 --> 00:29:03.193
(CEO Yu of Living App)

00:29:06.463 --> 00:29:07.693
Yes, hello.

00:29:08.063 --> 00:29:10.093
This is Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO of Mamdaerozip.

00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:12.093
We talked some time ago.

00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:15.903
Yes, you told me to reach out once I secured an investment.

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:17.603
That's right.

00:29:18.503 --> 00:29:21.203
I'll send you the materials my friend used to develop the app...

00:29:21.203 --> 00:29:22.673
in advance.

00:29:22.843 --> 00:29:25.273
Review them, and we can discuss them in the meeting.

00:29:25.743 --> 00:29:26.783
Got it.

00:29:27.213 --> 00:29:28.283
Hold on.

00:29:29.343 --> 00:29:31.783
The family has a five-year-old boy,

00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:34.523
so it'd be better to round off the wall corner...

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.753
where the playroom meets the living room.

00:29:37.823 --> 00:29:39.193
Ms. Ji, not again.

00:29:39.193 --> 00:29:40.993
That wasn't part of the plan.

00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:43.793
Just like Chief Cha,

00:29:43.793 --> 00:29:46.533
you could round the corner by shaping the plywood.

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:47.633
Unbelievable.

00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:52.233
You look more exhausted than the last time I saw you,

00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:53.843
yet you're still giving out freebies.

00:29:54.273 --> 00:29:56.103
Why are you always like this?

00:29:57.043 --> 00:29:59.713
I told you when we discussed the indirect lighting.

00:29:59.813 --> 00:30:01.513
The family has a tight budget.

00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:03.153
Unbelievable.

00:30:05.813 --> 00:30:07.353
Okay, fine. I'll get it done.

00:30:08.683 --> 00:30:09.793
Thank you.

00:30:10.023 --> 00:30:12.723
In return, I'll bring high-quality snacks tomorrow.

00:30:13.263 --> 00:30:15.163
You'd better.

00:30:15.363 --> 00:30:17.693
Guys, let's clean up and head home.

00:30:17.693 --> 00:30:19.133
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:30:23.873 --> 00:30:25.803
(Mom)

00:30:26.643 --> 00:30:28.203
Hey, Mom. I'll be heading out soon.

00:30:28.203 --> 00:30:29.343
Hold on.

00:30:29.343 --> 00:30:31.743
Don't come to the restaurant. Just come home instead.

00:30:32.143 --> 00:30:33.383
I closed up for the day.

00:30:33.983 --> 00:30:34.983
Why?

00:30:35.943 --> 00:30:37.613
Gang Oh called.

00:30:37.613 --> 00:30:39.883
He has something to say and told us to come home.

00:30:41.023 --> 00:30:42.123
Home?

00:30:43.123 --> 00:30:44.153
I see.

00:30:45.023 --> 00:30:47.523
All right. I'll head home right away.

00:30:57.033 --> 00:30:58.703
(Su Jeong)

00:31:02.743 --> 00:31:05.243
Hey, Su Jeong. I can't stop by the cafe today.

00:31:05.243 --> 00:31:06.743
Gang Oh's home.

00:31:13.653 --> 00:31:14.653
What did Gang Oh say?

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:18.323
He's been quiet, saying he'll only talk once you arrive.

00:31:18.623 --> 00:31:21.823
My heart has been racing ever since.

00:31:34.803 --> 00:31:37.343
Let's go outside. We'll talk alone.

00:31:38.243 --> 00:31:39.913
Mom should hear this too.

00:31:42.183 --> 00:31:43.683
Sit on the floor, then.

00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:46.953
Mom, sit with us.

00:31:47.523 --> 00:31:48.523
Sure.

00:31:55.963 --> 00:31:57.493
Where have you been?

00:31:58.693 --> 00:32:00.133
You should have at least called Mom.

00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:01.463
You knew she'd be worried.

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:03.573
I was too lost in thought to think about that.

00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:09.143
I thought long and hard, you see.

00:32:11.343 --> 00:32:13.213
- So? - Come on.

00:32:13.883 --> 00:32:15.443
Why did you need...

00:32:15.443 --> 00:32:18.253
to think long and hard about this?

00:32:19.683 --> 00:32:20.853
I knew it.

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:22.753
You didn't tell her.

00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:25.253
You didn't tell her how I've been wronged,

00:32:25.253 --> 00:32:26.823
how much you've taken from me.

00:32:28.563 --> 00:32:30.463
What are you talking about?

00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:34.333
Mom, listen to me.

00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:36.233
What you spent on Ji Eun Oh,

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:38.133
who isn't your real daughter,

00:32:38.903 --> 00:32:40.503
and the benefits she received...

00:32:40.903 --> 00:32:42.743
were mine and were taken from me.

00:32:44.343 --> 00:32:45.343
What?

00:32:45.343 --> 00:32:46.413
So...

00:32:47.213 --> 00:32:49.313
give me back the money...

00:32:49.883 --> 00:32:50.953
my dad spent on you.

00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:53.253
Start with 20,000 dollars.

00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:56.223
What?

00:32:56.623 --> 00:32:59.053
Gang Oh, what on earth are you saying?

00:32:59.123 --> 00:33:00.793
It's what she took from me!

00:33:00.793 --> 00:33:02.993
She needs to return what was originally mine.

00:33:03.793 --> 00:33:05.363
If you want to live with Mom, that is.

00:33:05.363 --> 00:33:07.833
Have you lost your mind?

00:33:09.803 --> 00:33:11.573
Eun Oh's your sister.

00:33:11.873 --> 00:33:13.703
She's your dad's and my daughter.

00:33:13.703 --> 00:33:15.303
Not to me, she's not.

00:33:15.303 --> 00:33:17.213
I believe in blood ties, Mom,

00:33:17.513 --> 00:33:20.013
so don't you tell me to think otherwise.

00:33:20.013 --> 00:33:21.783
I'm your real son,

00:33:21.783 --> 00:33:23.853
and Ji Eun Oh's the one you adopted.

00:33:23.853 --> 00:33:25.783
She's not your real daughter.

00:33:25.783 --> 00:33:28.283
How could you say this, Gang Oh?

00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:30.893
She's your big sister!

00:33:30.893 --> 00:33:32.493
She was your sister from the moment you were born.

00:33:32.493 --> 00:33:35.493
How could you be so cruel to her?

00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:37.563
She's not my sister by blood.

00:33:39.093 --> 00:33:40.333
We might share fond memories,

00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:41.663
but do you know what I remember the most?

00:33:42.463 --> 00:33:44.803
Even at department stores, you bought things for her first.

00:33:44.803 --> 00:33:46.843
You always bought her whatever she wanted to eat first.

00:33:46.843 --> 00:33:48.603
When I wanted a padded jacket from Uvis,

00:33:48.603 --> 00:33:50.813
I had to wear a boring one from South all because of her.

00:33:51.343 --> 00:33:53.783
She's also the reason I had to quit soccer.

00:33:53.813 --> 00:33:55.183
You just weren't good enough.

00:33:55.183 --> 00:33:56.953
How is that your sister's fault?

00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:59.313
Why didn't you let me go to the soccer camp in the UK?

00:33:59.813 --> 00:34:01.023
It was too expensive.

00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:04.053
You brat!

00:34:04.753 --> 00:34:07.893
That was right after your father's company went under.

00:34:08.993 --> 00:34:10.563
If you had saved up instead of spending money on her,

00:34:10.563 --> 00:34:12.663
Dad's company might not have taken a hit.

00:34:14.303 --> 00:34:16.033
- What? - Should I continue?

00:34:16.203 --> 00:34:17.333
I could do this all night.

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:20.443
No, that's enough.

00:34:23.943 --> 00:34:27.013
What will you do with the 20,000 dollars I give you?

00:34:27.813 --> 00:34:29.013
That's none of your business.

00:34:29.113 --> 00:34:30.953
Just give me the money. Take it from your savings,

00:34:30.953 --> 00:34:32.783
borrow it, or get a loan.

00:34:34.323 --> 00:34:35.323
No.

00:34:38.923 --> 00:34:40.223
I won't do any of that...

00:34:41.293 --> 00:34:43.023
because I won't give you my money.

00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:44.663
What?

00:34:45.093 --> 00:34:47.363
The 20,000 dollars I let you borrow...

00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:49.933
Actually, it's 24,000 dollars.

00:34:50.603 --> 00:34:52.173
You haven't paid even a cent of it back.

00:34:53.743 --> 00:34:55.243
I told you to pay me back.

00:34:55.773 --> 00:34:57.013
You won't give me any money?

00:35:04.383 --> 00:35:06.983
You're shameless and selfish, all rolled into one.

00:35:08.123 --> 00:35:09.923
Gang Oh, watch your words.

00:35:10.593 --> 00:35:13.723
If you don't give me the money, you'll be kicked out of this house.

00:35:13.823 --> 00:35:15.593
Says who?

00:35:16.693 --> 00:35:17.763
Listen to me loud and clear.

00:35:21.133 --> 00:35:23.133
I won't give you any of my money.

00:35:24.273 --> 00:35:26.233
Pay me back what you borrowed last time,

00:35:27.203 --> 00:35:29.343
and help Mom at the restaurant until closing.

00:35:34.213 --> 00:35:36.043
You've got to be kidding me.

00:35:40.053 --> 00:35:41.123
Ji Eun Oh.

00:35:42.323 --> 00:35:44.793
Whose child are you to be this shameless?

00:35:45.653 --> 00:35:47.163
Who are your real parents?

00:35:48.993 --> 00:35:51.733
Oh, no! Gang Oh. My gosh.

00:35:52.463 --> 00:35:53.733
Goodness me.

00:35:56.873 --> 00:36:00.543
No, don't. Gang Oh, please!

00:36:01.803 --> 00:36:02.903
Gang Oh...

00:36:08.513 --> 00:36:09.683
Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:13.213
What?

00:36:14.653 --> 00:36:16.253
I can't live under the same roof as her.

00:36:17.923 --> 00:36:20.593
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:37.843
It's Eun Oh.

00:36:38.773 --> 00:36:39.873
My daughter.

00:36:42.683 --> 00:36:43.853
Your big sister.

00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:50.193
You choose Ji Eun Oh?

00:36:54.593 --> 00:36:55.623
Fine.

00:36:56.963 --> 00:36:57.963
I got it.

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:01.003
Have a good life with her.

00:37:01.763 --> 00:37:02.763
Goodness.

00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:21.953
Gang Oh, what's the matter with you?

00:37:22.123 --> 00:37:24.923
Like you care! You just told me to leave.

00:37:25.693 --> 00:37:28.493
Gang Oh, you can't do this.

00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:30.293
You know...

00:37:30.293 --> 00:37:33.293
what your sister did for us after your dad passed away.

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:34.963
It's thanks to her...

00:37:34.963 --> 00:37:36.933
that we're making a living running our restaurant.

00:37:36.933 --> 00:37:38.703
How could you treat her this way?

00:37:40.873 --> 00:37:42.243
As if that makes up for anything.

00:37:43.203 --> 00:37:45.913
Just abandon me and live a good life with her!

00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:49.313
Gang Oh, what has gotten into you?

00:37:49.313 --> 00:37:51.253
Gang Oh, please.

00:37:53.753 --> 00:37:56.853
(Taxi, Reserved)

00:37:58.893 --> 00:37:59.893
Hey.

00:38:00.263 --> 00:38:01.323
Gang Oh!

00:38:01.593 --> 00:38:02.663
Gang Oh.

00:38:02.663 --> 00:38:04.633
- Gang Oh, no. - As if.

00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:08.033
If you leave now,

00:38:08.863 --> 00:38:10.063
it'll be over between us.

00:38:10.803 --> 00:38:12.103
I won't let you back into my life.

00:38:12.933 --> 00:38:14.073
What a joke.

00:38:14.943 --> 00:38:17.343
We should never have been a family in the first place.

00:38:18.543 --> 00:38:21.243
Tell Mom she won't see me again until things are back...

00:38:21.243 --> 00:38:22.383
to normal.

00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:27.923
Gang Oh!

00:38:27.983 --> 00:38:28.983
Gang Oh.

00:38:29.853 --> 00:38:30.893
Gang Oh!

00:39:18.073 --> 00:39:21.243
You crazy brat. How could he say that to me?

00:39:27.683 --> 00:39:28.713
Eun Oh.

00:39:29.013 --> 00:39:30.083
Mom.

00:39:31.653 --> 00:39:34.523
Let's not say anything today.

00:40:07.783 --> 00:40:08.853
Are you hungry?

00:40:10.253 --> 00:40:11.323
No.

00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:13.623
As if. Of course, you're hungry.

00:40:14.263 --> 00:40:15.963
Your packed meal was obviously a salad.

00:40:17.963 --> 00:40:20.193
Hey, let me ask you this one thing.

00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:23.303
Why must you always have a salad?

00:40:24.103 --> 00:40:26.603
I want to stay fit and healthy.

00:40:27.143 --> 00:40:28.743
It's not like you want to be in show business.

00:40:29.243 --> 00:40:31.743
You're slim already, so why worry about your weight?

00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:33.573
On top of that,

00:40:33.573 --> 00:40:35.443
doesn't art require stamina too?

00:40:42.623 --> 00:40:43.693
Didn't you hear me?

00:40:44.253 --> 00:40:45.293
We should go back...

00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:48.123
to a strictly driver-employer relationship.

00:40:49.993 --> 00:40:50.993
What?

00:40:51.733 --> 00:40:52.763
It's uncomfortable.

00:40:53.703 --> 00:40:54.733
What is?

00:40:56.063 --> 00:40:57.173
You.

00:41:00.643 --> 00:41:02.873
You just want me to drive you?

00:41:03.843 --> 00:41:05.013
Like before?

00:41:05.143 --> 00:41:06.513
And treat you like a lady?

00:41:08.443 --> 00:41:10.553
No. I won't go back to that.

00:41:10.983 --> 00:41:13.283
I quit. Tell your mom.

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:17.623
Okay.

00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:36.003
You're maintaining your weight. Good for you.

00:41:38.273 --> 00:41:39.373
Mom.

00:41:40.243 --> 00:41:42.843
You haven't found a new driver yet?

00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:45.353
Why? Is something wrong?

00:41:45.813 --> 00:41:48.483
No, but the current driver is a temporary replacement.

00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:52.593
Yes. I knew that would bother you too.

00:41:53.453 --> 00:41:54.823
I'm down to two candidates.

00:41:55.063 --> 00:41:56.623
I'll decide tomorrow or the day after.

00:41:59.633 --> 00:42:01.163
Since our new technology...

00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:04.273
won an award at the Silicon Valley Invention Exhibition,

00:42:04.473 --> 00:42:05.833
we've been getting many calls...

00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:07.543
from Europe as well as the US.

00:42:08.773 --> 00:42:11.573
The Italian buyer who asked to tour our Gangnam store.

00:42:11.813 --> 00:42:12.943
Who will escort them?

00:42:12.943 --> 00:42:15.543
Global Operations Director Yoon and Team Leader Kang.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.183
I'll join them.

00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:23.523
You will?

00:42:24.153 --> 00:42:26.193
We're yet to enter Europe.

00:42:26.523 --> 00:42:28.763
It would be wise to treat the buyer with care.

00:42:37.873 --> 00:42:40.673
Join Director Yoon and look around.

00:42:42.343 --> 00:42:44.543
Yes, sir. I won't overstep.

00:42:44.713 --> 00:42:46.473
- Okay. - Bye, then.

00:42:53.683 --> 00:42:55.683
Did I get out of the wrong side of the bed today?

00:42:56.123 --> 00:42:58.923
Why is he volunteering to do something?

00:43:01.623 --> 00:43:02.623

so we'll wire 50,000 dollars right away.

Oh, right.

00:44:32.601 --> 00:44:34.241
This is what I wanted.

00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:37.711
I love it so much. Oh, my!

00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:39.641
It cost a lot more,

00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.281
but the kitchen looks much classier.

00:44:43.751 --> 00:44:45.381
The bathroom looks great,

00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:46.621
and the finishing's clean.

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.881
I owe it all to you, Ms. Ji.

00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:52.191
You managed the whole process so well.

00:44:52.191 --> 00:44:53.261
Thank you.

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:54.891
You're welcome.

00:44:55.891 --> 00:44:57.761
Good luck moving in,

00:44:57.891 --> 00:45:00.561
and call Mamdaerozip if there are any problems.

00:45:00.701 --> 00:45:01.701
I will.

00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:04.231
Mamdaerozip will provide the maintenance.

00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:08.171
Honey, look at this.

00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:09.671
A sliding door.

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.521
Are you going to the cafe?

00:45:24.551 --> 00:45:26.591
Let's have lunch together.

00:45:32.831 --> 00:45:34.461
The project's over.

00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:37.301
Do I still have to call you "Ms. Ji?"

00:45:38.801 --> 00:45:40.071
Isn't that obvious?

00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:42.101
I thought that was the deal.

00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.281
Let's eat together...

00:45:47.781 --> 00:45:49.911
to celebrate a successful first project, Ms. Ji.

00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:52.281
No, thank you. Bye.

00:45:52.781 --> 00:45:53.781
Wait.

00:45:56.151 --> 00:45:58.991
I just want us to have lunch.

00:45:59.421 --> 00:46:01.921
As the CEO of Mamdaerozip.

00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:03.561
I don't want to.

00:46:08.831 --> 00:46:10.601
You don't have to mind me,

00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:13.371
and you don't have to worry either.

00:46:16.241 --> 00:46:17.271
Then...

00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:25.581
Take this.

00:46:28.751 --> 00:46:31.451
It's 18,000 dollars. I paid you 2,000 beforehand.

00:46:38.031 --> 00:46:39.031
What's that look about?

00:46:39.591 --> 00:46:42.261
Did you think I wouldn't pay you...

00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:43.571
for your services?

00:46:44.931 --> 00:46:46.001
I don't believe it.

00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:48.971
Where did you get the money?

00:46:49.301 --> 00:46:50.371
I got an investment.

00:46:51.071 --> 00:46:54.081
An official investment from Double S Startup.

00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:55.911
Here.

00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:02.751
Good for you.

00:47:20.541 --> 00:47:21.541
Here.

00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:25.141
Why are you giving me this?

00:47:25.471 --> 00:47:27.511
I did my job as a coordinator.

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:29.181
I'll take the money just for that.

00:47:29.541 --> 00:47:30.551
No.

00:47:30.951 --> 00:47:33.151
I made a special offer to pay you 20,000 dollars,

00:47:33.721 --> 00:47:34.781
and you agreed.

00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:36.721
Our contract says so.

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.491
What's wrong?

00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:42.261
Do you feel sorry for me?

00:47:44.391 --> 00:47:45.731
It's not that.

00:47:46.261 --> 00:47:47.561
It's for my peace of mind.

00:47:48.001 --> 00:47:49.101
That's your problem.

00:47:50.671 --> 00:47:52.301
You put your pride and ego first,

00:47:52.701 --> 00:47:54.201
despite your circumstances.

00:47:55.471 --> 00:47:57.341
Why would you refuse what you're owed?

00:47:57.471 --> 00:47:59.011
You should be asking for more.

00:47:59.571 --> 00:48:01.011
Why do you keep nagging?

00:48:01.581 --> 00:48:03.251
How dare you lecture me?

00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.851
Why do you keep criticizing what I do?

00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:06.751
Ji Eun Oh.

00:48:07.921 --> 00:48:10.151
I might be someone you resent forever,

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.391
but you're still simply Ji Eun Oh to me.

00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:16.161
Ever since we met when I came back to college.

00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:20.261
You might be able to...

00:48:20.901 --> 00:48:22.831
hate me or resent me, but I can't.

00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:25.431
How could I?

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.811
I called a taxi to take us to the restaurant.

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:35.881
Let's go to the cafe.

00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:38.351
I want to walk alone.

00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:44.691
Why...

00:49:01.941 --> 00:49:03.041
Ji Eun Oh.

00:49:03.471 --> 00:49:05.741
Whose child are you to be this shameless?

00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:08.041
Who are your real parents?

00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:22.361
(Spicy and Sweet)

00:49:54.061 --> 00:49:55.121
Eun Oh.

00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:58.061
Hello, Mr. Park.

00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:03.901
Are you all right?

00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:08.941
Get on my back.

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.811
Why is she so light?

00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:26.321
Hey, get Eun Oh a chair to sit on.

00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.021
I think she needs to lie down.

00:50:28.021 --> 00:50:29.391
- Come this way. - Okay.

00:50:33.361 --> 00:50:34.531
Wait.

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:35.531
Okay.

00:50:47.741 --> 00:50:48.811
What happened?

00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:51.911
I ran into her on the street.

00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:53.821
Did she pass out?

00:50:55.181 --> 00:50:56.221
Almost.

00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.991
Do you think it's because of overwork?

00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:05.161
Or was she stressed out because of Gang Oh?

00:51:08.831 --> 00:51:10.271
Where were you going?

00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:13.901
Oh, right.

00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:16.141
I have to get going.

00:51:16.141 --> 00:51:17.271
I'm meeting with a buyer.

00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:20.011
Should I have taken her to the hospital?

00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:21.111
No.

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:23.041
She's asleep, so I'll take care of her.

00:51:24.211 --> 00:51:26.251
Okay. I appreciate it.

00:51:31.151 --> 00:51:32.621
Why would he appreciate me?

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:35.761
Ji Hyuk, are you all right?

00:51:36.521 --> 00:51:38.731
Yes. I won't be using the keyboard, so it will be fine.

00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:40.501
You can go and work at the cafe.

00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:43.531
I was asking if he was okay.

00:53:42.051 --> 00:53:43.281
Don't get up so quickly.

00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:46.791
You might pass out again, feeling dizzy.

00:54:03.001 --> 00:54:04.341
I owe you one.

00:54:06.441 --> 00:54:08.311
If you know that, make sure to eat...

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.441
when someone asks you to.

00:54:13.151 --> 00:54:14.521
There's nothing I can do for you, right?

00:54:16.991 --> 00:54:17.991
No.

00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:34.271
I remember that Mr. Park was carrying me on his back.

00:54:39.771 --> 00:54:42.581
I bet you haven't been eating or sleeping.

00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:44.981
You're right.

00:54:45.351 --> 00:54:46.511
And what else?

00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:49.021
Something else happened with Gang Oh, right?

00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:52.491
Since the day you went home to see Gang Oh a few days ago,

00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:54.291
you haven't been in your right mind.

00:54:56.931 --> 00:54:58.531
Buy some porridge for Eun Oh.

00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:07.641
Min Woo, I'll go and buy Eun Oh some porridge.

00:55:07.641 --> 00:55:09.101
It's busy, but hold down the fort while I'm gone.

00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:10.341
Okay.

00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:13.841
No. It's a busy time for the cafe.

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.611
It's okay.

00:55:15.641 --> 00:55:17.311
And I need to hear what's going on.

00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:22.981
Hello.

00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:24.521
Hello.

00:55:37.471 --> 00:55:38.831
This is delicious.

00:55:39.201 --> 00:55:40.541
I know. This place must be famous.

00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:42.341
- The food is good. - It's nice.

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:55.421
Da Jeong.

00:55:55.721 --> 00:55:57.851
Now that you're here to meet us,

00:55:57.851 --> 00:55:59.251
I guess everything is sorted out.

00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:02.261
Of course. They say time heals all wounds.

00:56:04.891 --> 00:56:06.091
What about Sang Cheol?

00:56:06.831 --> 00:56:09.431
Is he doing well as an advisor at the new company?

00:56:09.431 --> 00:56:11.131
Let's not talk about my husband.

00:56:11.131 --> 00:56:12.501
He's doing just fine.

00:56:12.501 --> 00:56:14.641
If we don't talk about our husbands and children when we meet,

00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:16.001
what else can we talk about?

00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:17.341
Politics?

00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:19.241
We just ask each other how our families are doing.

00:56:20.341 --> 00:56:22.211
You know I still work,

00:56:22.211 --> 00:56:24.351
and we have Myeong Hui. Why don't you hear our complaints?

00:56:24.351 --> 00:56:26.651
Right. I have a lot to talk about today.

00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:28.921
There's nothing new about you two.

00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:30.991
What I want to hear about is Ji Hyuk.

00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:35.021
What about him?

00:56:36.161 --> 00:56:38.291
Has your son come to his senses yet?

00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:42.201
- What? - I don't know...

00:56:42.201 --> 00:56:44.031
how he got tangled up in the rich girl's affair,

00:56:44.371 --> 00:56:46.801
but he got into big trouble because of his foolish dream.

00:56:47.941 --> 00:56:48.941
Hey.

00:56:49.471 --> 00:56:52.441
Has a rich girl ever proposed to your son?

00:56:52.671 --> 00:56:54.741
Can you believe what she's saying?

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.981
Hey, is a proposal a big deal?

00:56:57.481 --> 00:56:59.451
The girl eloped with another guy.

00:56:59.451 --> 00:57:01.551
- Mi Yeong, stop it. - Goodness.

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:05.451
I'm just asking her the questions you were curious about.

00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:10.731
Mi Yeong, I heard your husband cheated on you for the third time.

00:57:11.091 --> 00:57:12.631
What? The third time?

00:57:12.631 --> 00:57:15.161
No. It was his second time...

00:57:17.931 --> 00:57:21.171
I see. So, the third time was just a rumour.

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:25.071
Is there any evidence that Ji Hyuk's fiancee eloped?

00:57:25.671 --> 00:57:26.771
No, right?

00:57:27.981 --> 00:57:29.041
Oh, right.

00:57:29.481 --> 00:57:31.411
Whether it was the 2nd or 3rd time,

00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:33.981
how are you managing life with a husband who cheated on you?

00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:35.151
Is it all right?

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.181
Are you just living your life with no purpose?

00:57:36.181 --> 00:57:39.051
- Hey, Kim Da Jeong! - So watch your mouth, you fool.

00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:41.821
Even in high school, your nickname was Blabbermouth.

00:57:42.621 --> 00:57:44.061
Will bad-mouthing my son...

00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:45.831
make your husband come back after cheating on you?

00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:49.161
You don't mind if I talk about your husband, do you?

00:57:51.171 --> 00:57:53.371
Girls, from now on,

00:57:53.371 --> 00:57:54.941
I'll call her Big Blabbermouth.

00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:58.711
Hey, isn't she being too harsh on me?

00:57:59.541 --> 00:58:01.611
You messed with her first.

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.811
- Let's eat, Da Jeong. - Yes, let's eat.

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:07.121
Actually, we called you out to cheer you up today.

00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:08.881
I know.

00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:10.891
I'm feeling better already.

00:58:11.191 --> 00:58:13.391
So, let's just skip that part.

00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:16.091
Still, let me pay for the meal today.

00:58:16.091 --> 00:58:17.561
What are you talking about?

00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:20.261
I made you come to the wedding for nothing.

00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:22.201
And Big Blabbermouth had to pay for transportation.

00:58:22.201 --> 00:58:23.561
I should treat you girls today.

00:58:24.301 --> 00:58:25.471
Let's eat.

00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:27.241
- All right. - Let's eat.

00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:34.681
Ji Hyuk.

00:58:36.481 --> 00:58:38.581
I miss you so much.

00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:43.851
When on earth are you going to come back?

00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:48.821
Where are you and what are you doing?

00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:52.461
You brat.

00:58:53.461 --> 00:58:54.931
Does hiding for a year...

00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:57.001
make your embarrassment go away?

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.571
The only thing you can do...

00:59:01.201 --> 00:59:03.911
is admit your mistakes and move forward.

00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:16.651
Why did you not say anything when I said hi?

00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:19.291
What are you doing?

00:59:21.191 --> 00:59:22.261
I'm eating.

00:59:23.161 --> 00:59:24.161
What...

00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:26.231
I'm hungry.

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:31.201
Why are you eating here alone when you're supposed to cook dinner?

00:59:33.001 --> 00:59:35.471
Am I someone who cooks dinner every single day?

00:59:35.941 --> 00:59:37.811
So what if I eat first for once?

00:59:39.611 --> 00:59:41.781
Did you have a bad day?

00:59:44.311 --> 00:59:45.811
I did, which is why I'm like this.

00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:52.091
- Okay. I'll have ramyeon... - That darn ramyeon.

00:59:52.951 --> 00:59:54.391
Men cook that...

00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:56.021
as if they're making a huge sacrifice.

00:59:56.561 --> 00:59:58.061
There are side dishes in the fridge,

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.591
rice in the freezer, and soup in the pot.

00:59:59.591 --> 01:00:00.901
Why can't you heat that up?

01:00:02.261 --> 01:00:05.771
Su Bin, what should I do in this situation?

01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:09.371
- I'll set the table. - Gosh, I'm hungry.

01:00:10.471 --> 01:00:11.971
I smell something nice.

01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:15.541
Mother.

01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:19.181
Will you have bibimbap instead?

01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.551
We have seasoned radish and stir-fried bracken.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:28.191
Yes. Let's have that.

01:00:40.741 --> 01:00:42.171
What's up with her?

01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:46.041
What else could it be about?

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.111
It's her son.

01:00:52.381 --> 01:00:53.681
Kim Da Jeong.

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.791
You won't tell me what it's about?

01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:03.861
I miss Ji Hyuk.

01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:07.561
That's it?

01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:11.171
Doesn't he miss home?

01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:14.901
(Cafe Agit)

01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:17.231
There's a co-working space...

01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:19.571
near my office where we can talk.

01:02:19.931 --> 01:02:21.071
Will you come over?

01:02:23.201 --> 01:02:25.141
Pulling an all-nighter? That's not a problem.

01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:27.481
I'll bring what we need.

01:02:27.681 --> 01:02:29.111
See you there. Bye.

01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:44.591
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:46.351
You're still up, Mom?

01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:48.961
Hey, Eun Oh. You're home early.

01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:50.761
- Let go! - What's going on over there?

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:52.961
Who are you?

01:03:53.231 --> 01:03:54.701
I'm her dad. So what?

01:03:55.061 --> 01:03:56.561
Something happened to Ji Eun Oh.

01:03:56.561 --> 01:03:57.871
And from what I observed,

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.201
there are two men in her vicinity.

01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:01.671
What's this?

01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:04.411
My confession. Don't we make a nice couple?

01:04:05.211 --> 01:04:06.311
Date me.

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:09.111
Ji Eun Oh!

01:04:09.381 --> 01:04:11.511
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:13.651
Are you stupid? Doesn't your brain work?

01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.121
You're getting to me in so many ways.
