00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.170
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.410
Correct.
[Dispatch]

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.460
[Unmuted]

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.520
Ma'am, I've also sent an ambulance your way.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.480
Is there any trace of smoke left in the room?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.230
Yes, just a bit.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.480
As expected. She just passed the exam calmly.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.430
In that case, please keep your fan running at full blast.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.170
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.320
Well, I'm calling about my husband.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.860
- I'm listening.
- He was vaccinated, you see.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.110
But he's spiked an uncomfortable looking fever.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.450
May I ask for a name and address, Ma'am?

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.520
3-18 Komyodai, Izumi Ward. Our family name is "Akiba."

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.180
"Akiba-san."

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.980
- And may I get an age?
- Seventy-eight.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.230
So your 78-year-old husband developed a fever, right?
[78, male]

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.230
Sorry, I am 78.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.290
My husband is 82.
[Fever]

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.290
Understood. And he was vaccinated for the flu?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.060
Yes. But he keeps going on and on about feeling sick.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.790
How high is his fever, Ma'am?

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.380
His fever? Dear, were you at 39℃?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.670
Well, I'm not certain, but I believe it is about 39℃.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.860
A fever of about 39℃.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.670
Does he have any difficulty breathing or chest pains?

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.410
Yes. Like I said, I think he has the flu.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.210
But he insists he's okay and that he'll visit the hospital later.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.220
In that case, we recommend he take an ambulance there.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.310
Dear, they're calling the ambulance.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.180
What? I said the ambulance.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.740
No? No ambulance? If you insist.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.390
See? He keeps saying he doesn't need an ambulance.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.080
I see. Then if he begins to lose consciousness

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.080
or has greater difficulty breathing, please call 119 right away.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.670
Yes, yes. I will.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.150
Ma'am—

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.500
[Ambulance Status]

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.790
- Oh, you scared me!
- This individual may be in trouble.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.400
- What?
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.560
Ma'am, please remain calm.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.020
Akiba-san, 82 years old, yes?

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.680
"Akiba-san"? I'll take that call.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.840
Akiba-san, I am the person who assisted you earlier.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.970
I told you that you needed an ambulance.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.750
You just refused to listen, didn't you?

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.240
- Ma'am, what happened?
- My husband is in pain.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.190
He's breathing heavily and can't even stand.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.440
He might have pneumonia​.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.130
Is he conscious?

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.640
- Can he speak?
- No, not at all.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.700
He only breathes heavily.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.170
Dear? Dear!

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.990
See? He sounds raspy!

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.820
All paramedics are dispatched.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.700
Ma'am, we will send an ambulance.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.620
However, it may take a bit of time.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.920
Please call out to your husband and encourage him, Akiba-san.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.450
We will stay on the line.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.070
Dear? Dear!

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.020
- No...
- No?

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.650
He's... stopped responding.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.530
He stopped responding?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.110
Is he still rasping?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.270
I mean, is he... Is he breathing, Ma'am?

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.750
- I don't know anymore.
- What should I...

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.240
He's gotten all quiet!

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.630
In that case, what about his chest? Is it moving?

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.230
"His chest"?

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.230
- His chest, right?
- Yes. Is it moving up and down?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.230
No.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.410
I understand.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.410
Akiba-san, it seems your husband is no longer breathing.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.490
May I ask for your assistance with administering CPR?

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.110
What? CP, what?

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.160
CPR. Ma'am, what position is your husband in right now?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.130
H-He's lying down.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.110
Is it possible to have him lying face up?

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.620
Yes. Upward, is it?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.670
Yes, have him face upward, and...

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.880
I will call her back.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.650
Fire departments' 119. Akiba-san? Akiba-san, can you hear?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.680
Yes. I have him facing upward.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.870
I'm glad we got through. Now, I will walk you through the steps of CPR.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.290
Miss, I think this man is gone.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.890
His mouth is gaping open like a fish.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.470
Even so...

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.410
- We'd like you to try, Ma'am.
- Try what?

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.860
For now, a fire squad is going ahead of an ambulance.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.980
But they're still 5 kilometers out. It'll be a while before they arrive.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.980
CPR. Ma'am, your husband has stopped breathing.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.020
- If we do not begin now...
- What? I can't; it's impossible.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.450
Let's try our best only until the ambulance arrives.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.900
Place your palms on his chest

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.890
- and extend your arms...
- No, I can't! I can't do this!

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.920
Don't worry, Ma'am. I'm here with you.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.780
Please press down on his chest from about 5 centimeters up, on my cue.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.320
- One, two, three...
- I can't!

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.450
I have a hunchback, and everything hurts, and...

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.620
Please try, Ma'am.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.120
I promise we will save him.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.270
We will.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.910
So please give your best effort with me.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.940
One, two, three...

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.810
How old is this individual?

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.870
- He's 82 years old.
- No, the one who called.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.580
- She's 78 years old.
- She's nearing eighty herself.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.580
Do you think she can correctly administer CPR, given her body's condition?

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.410
If you push her, you'll put her in danger as well.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.200
His heart has already stopped.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200
Our firefighters are still 4 km out.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.470
Even if they assist upon arrival,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.720
chances are very low that they'd manage to resuscitate him.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.340
Isn't there anything else?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.210
- An artificial respirator. That could―
- Kasuhara-san!

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.190
He won't make it.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.490
- But I promised to save...
- That's why you should never say that!

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.890
Miss, I appreciate your assistance.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.080
An ambulance is on its way, right?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.550
I will talk with the paramedics when they arrive.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.570
I understand.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.270
Then please remain at your husband's side until they arrive.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.660
I will.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.040
Kasuhara-san.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.710
Go ahead and take a breather.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.990
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.750
[Kasuhara]

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.150
I'm sorry for raising my voice earlier.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.160
No, I should be the one apologizing.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.900
I just couldn't give up on him.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.180
I understand wanting to give the caller some form of hope.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.140
But what happens when we can't save the individual?

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.270
Giving them hope is irresponsible and cruel, is it not?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.770
I promise I'll save him.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.720
Come back to us, please!

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.710
You promised you would save him.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.800
Why?

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.930
Why? You promised, didn't you?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.770
So why? Why?

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.620
You promised!

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.480
Why?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.960
Sorry. I wasn't trying to criticize you.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:21.070
When I was a little girl...

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.540
What?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:28.560
When I was little, I had to call 119 before.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.370
I was absolutely terrified.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.960
I was scared and couldn't do a thing.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:48.450
But the person on the other end promised everything would be okay.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.520
Those words gave me courage and ultimately saved my life.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.050
That's why, I...

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:15.520
Even if neither the caller nor we give up,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.970
there will always be lives we can't save.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.100
Technology is sure streamlined nowadays.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.960
I remember when you had to connect red, white, and yellow wires to the TV.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.860
Oh, really?

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.960
Oh, there we go.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.370
- Hello there.
- Hey.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.070
Hello.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.150
- These are from the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake.
- Yes.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.710
I was asked to give a talk about it.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.880
We're just running a quick tech test. Right, Tanaka?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.410
- Yes, Sir.
- I see.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.520
It's already been 30 years now, hasn't it?

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.610
That's right. I was 33 when it happened.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.440
As for you kids...

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.210
I guess none of you were born yet.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.010
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.630
I was sent to Kobe to aid with relief.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.470
Those Kobe rescue folks were working hard.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:35.740
They couldn't even check on their family and friends.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.120
There were simply too many victims to even count.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.050
They say some events break the body and spirit.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.420
This disaster felt like one of them.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.840
But... our fatigue was nothing

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.610
compared to the many victims who were out there, suffering.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.510
What do you think I realized in that moment?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.040
Well...

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.190
Time's up. Back to your stations.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.800
Oh...

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.430
Tanaka, how do I swap between this image here and my PowerPoint?

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.930
I will show you.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.180
First things first...

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.080

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.580
- Are you currently inside your vehicle?
- Yes.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.530
There should be an AED inside the rest area building.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.630
I'd like you to ask someone to go grab that AED for you.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.940
The AED... someone?

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.510
You're back! My wife has returned!

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.220
- It's Dad. He's in trouble!
- What? Dad?

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:16.350
I'm going to grab the AED; here's 119! Ask them what to do!

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.510
- Excuse me? What?
- Hello?

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.320
- Dad? Are you okay?
- Ma'am, can you hear me?

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.360
Yes, I can.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.790
- Are you this man's daughter?
- Yes.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.540
- Ma'am, your father may be suffering a heart attack.
- What?

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.990
He has also stopped breathing, so your husband is grabbing the AED.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.780
I see now. In that case, I must do CPR, yes?

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.330
Correct. Are you able to get your father out the car?

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.670
If not, you will need to administer CPR in the vehicle.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.410
We're driving a minivan,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.000
and my father sat in the back seat alone.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.560
If we bend his legs, he can lie down.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.060
- That will do.
- Okay.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.110
- Please lie your father down, facing upward.
- Okay.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.730
- One moment.
- Of course.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.200
They're 10 km away. It'll take 15 minutes minimum to get there.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.980
Let's ask the Kawasaki branch if they can send anyone.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.950
Kawasaki Fire, this is Yokohama Fire.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.200
This is Dispatcher Mita from Kawasaki speaking.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.180
This is Dispatcher Kaneshita from the Yokohama Bureau.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.240
We need paramedic backup.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.980
- The location is...
- We're ready!

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.510
- Please crouch next to your father.
- Okay.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.040
- Do you have enough space?
- I'll make do.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.760
I've pushed the seats forward as much as possible.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.780
I know basic CPR. I took a training course recently.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.790
- Understood. Please be sure to follow my count. Ready?
- Yes.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.730
One, two, three, four, five, six...

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:38.920
- Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:44.760
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:50.820
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Dad, please! Open your eyes!

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.160
You're back! The AED is here!

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.690
In that case, please hook up the AED while continuing CPR.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.770
Okay. I learned that as well.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.170
Then if you would, please.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.370
Dear, help me. Put on the AED while I continue CPR.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.690
- R-Right.
- Damn it.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.360
Kawasaki is swamped as well. They can't send anyone.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.520
We've hooked up the AED. It's currently checking my father.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.270
Understood. Please heed the AED for further instructions.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.250
We will.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.900
It's preparing for a shock.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.690
Please get everyone else clear of the AED.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.720
Right. Dear, get Haru out of her seat!

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.070
- And stand back!
- Okay!

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.820
Please push the button only when everyone else has cleared out.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.690
We're clear. I will press the button.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.700
- I've pressed the button.
- Shock has been administered.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.770
- Body is safe to touch.
- Please continue with the CPR, Ma'am.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.830
For two minutes, was it?

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.200
Yes, Ma'am. After two minutes, the AED will determine whether another shock is necessary.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.520
- Okay.
- Ready?

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:56.050
- One, two...
- Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.660
- Dear, give Haru her milk!
- One, two, three, four,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.940
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.460
- One, two, three, four,
- Dad... Dad!

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.540
- five, six, seven, keep at it.
- Please open your eyes!

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.820
- Nine, ten.
- Ten.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.060
- One, two, three, four, five,
- Dad, you can't!

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.490
- six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Wake up!

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.050
One, two...

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.120
- Follow the AED's beat.
- Yes.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.980
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.640
One, two,

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.220
One, two, one, two.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.880
- One, two, one, two.
- Dad, wake up!

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.180
One, two, you can do it!

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.980
- One, two, one, two...
- You can't die on your first trip with your grandchild!

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.020
One, two, one, two.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.560
One, two.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.200
- One, two, one, two.
- Dad!

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.280
- One, two, one, two.
- You have to watch Haru grow up!

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.340
- One, two, don't stop.
- Dad!

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.540
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.890
One, two, one, two...

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.690
- One, two, one, two.
- Come on...

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.720
- One, two, one, two.
- Micchan, I'll take over!

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.130
- Get some rest. I'll take over for you!
- Just give Haru her milk!

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.900
- One, two, one, two.
- One, two.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.840
One, two, one, two...

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.910
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.730
- One, two, one, two.
- "Tsuzuki"?

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:22.320
These are new homes going up for sale in Tsuzuki.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.720
Sir, these folks are currently at the Tsuzuki Rest Area, right?

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.180
Yes.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.840
That rest area is also connected to a local road, isn't it?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.290
Sure, but that's still 5 km from the hospital.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.050
It'd take them over 10 minutes to get there.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.360
Right.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.290
But that doesn't account for the new road.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.280
- New road?
- Where?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.780
- Right here.
- Here?

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.540
If they took this road, the hospital is only 2 km away.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.890
Takeda-san, please continue administering CPR.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.370
- Mr. Takeda, can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:01.270
Sir, that rest area is connected to a local road.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.500
I will guide you to the nearest hospital.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.040
- Could you drive your family there?
- Yes.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.550
Micchan, I'm going to drive us there! Keep at it!

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.130
A hospital, yes?

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.790
- I've input the search into our GPS.
- Okay.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.440
Sir, I'm going to guide you through a newly constructed road

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.850
- that may not be reflected on your GPS.
- Okay.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.730
- First, leave the rest area and take a left at the crossing.
- Yes!

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.210
Takeda-san, are you holding up?

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.330
One, two, one, two.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.950
She's reaching her limit.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:35.150
- One, two, one, two.
- Micchan, you got this!

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:40.190
- One, two, one, two, one, two.
- Dad, pull through!

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.740
One, two, one, two, you got this!

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.310
- One, two, one, two, one, two.
- My arms... I can't...

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.470
One, two.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:49.550
One, two, keep going.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:55.460
- One, two, one, two, one, two...
- Dad, I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.270
- One, two, one, two, one, two.
- Micchan! Micchan! Dad!

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.730
One, two, one, two.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.300
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.640
One, two, one, two.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.180
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.650
One, two, one, two.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.740
One, two.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.320
Ma'am, you got this. You can do this!

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.250
We're right here with you!

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.590
I promise we'll save his life!

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.190
- One, two, one, two!
- Micchan!

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.440
- One, two!
- Did you hear him?

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.860
- One, two, one...
- The man from 119 promised.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.680
- One, two, one, two!
- He's right here with us!

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.850
One, two, one, two!

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.670
- You got this! One, two, one, two!
- One, two, one, two...

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:43.370
- One, two, one, two!
- You can do this, Micchan!

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.790
- One, two, one, two!
- I know you can!

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.410
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:54.590
- One, two, one, two, one, two...
- Dad! My father he... He's conscious again!

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.800
Really?

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.230
I see the hospital right ahead!

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.660
- Is he breathing?
- Yes!

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.870
He seems in pain, but yes, he's breathing.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:06.830
Then you may rest your arms, Ma'am.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.230
The hospital is ready for you.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.650
Please head right to the ER.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.560
Thank you!

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.920
Then I'll end the call on my end.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.850
The calls are finally dying down.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.850
You're right.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.860
I'm sorry.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.540
I couldn't follow my own advice of not giving anyone promises.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.660
I guess not.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.500
But we're allowed to say it because we really mean it, right?

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.260
And that's true whether we're working onsite or as a dispatcher.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.690
Right.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.090
There you are.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:39.100
It's freezing out here.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.200
Dr. Minemoto, if you would tell him

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.670
how the patient from earlier is faring.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.940
The father's operation...

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.160
was a success.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.220
His daughter says her arms feel like lead, but she's fine, too.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.090
Thank goodness.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.610
What a relief.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.090
The daughter also had a message for you.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:16.610
She says, "Thank you for encouraging me not to give up on my father."

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.920
♫ You are calling out to me ♫

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.550
So...

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.920
great work!

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.070
Thank you.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.720
♫ Even if I'm scared ♫

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.020
I suppose we should return to our stations, too.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.870
Right.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:47.670
♫ No matter how deep the darkness ♫

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.900
♫ Without fail ♫

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.940
[Count me in for the reunion.]

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.700
["Copy that!"]

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.900
Yogo-san?

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.410
Coming.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.690
[Preview]

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.340
It seems a friend of mine collapsed.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:14.440
- And the address is 3-6 Teraocho, Naka Ward, Yokohama...
- The same complex?

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.140
This means the report was false, right?

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.770
Kasuhara, be more careful than ever.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.000
Their voices sound similar.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.100
Ultimately, you can only trust you made the right decision.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.990
Even if a hundred calls are false alarms,

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:33.460
we still must respond to the hundred and first.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.290
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.370
I believe that by doing our own work,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.770
we are saving someone’s life in the long run.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.720
I pray today is another day that passes without disaster.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.100
Uesugi!

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:53.550
So I went on a walk, but my leg started to hurt again.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.220
Are you still in pain, Sir?
