00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.426
It is time to begin

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.261
the second round of the competition
between Joseon and the Ming.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.514
Today's theme is
ji for "know," yeok for "change."

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.933
You must cook a dish
from each other's country.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.269
- Our second dish, Peking duck.
- Let us begin.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.563
Where did they get
such a massive lotus flower?

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.273
It is overwhelmingly big.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.232
A golden lotus?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.111
Okay. We'll start
by hanging the ducks to roast.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.947
- Pouring oil over it makes it…
- Crispy.

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.616
Is that the Northern Capital roast duck?

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.619
The Ming cooks in action
are truly an impressive sight.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.579
Trust me this once.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.707
This is a temple dish.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.667
This is Peking duck.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.130
The dishes from both sides are complete.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.841
This concludes
the tasting of the second round,

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.093
and the evaluation will follow.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.019
I will announce
the scores for the second round.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.994
ONE

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.038
EIGHT

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.466
{\an8}JOSEON: 1, MING: 8

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.010
- What?
- My goodness.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.054
I do not believe this.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.405
Tang Bailong, step forward.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.161
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.538
The skills you learned

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.832
from visiting temples all over Joseon

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.044
in order to create the ultimate taste
are truly remarkable.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.339
Not only did your temple dish
take us by surprise,

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:58.303
but its flavor also offered
profound insight and serene resonance.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.389
YU KUN
MING'S CHIEF ENVOY

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:02.307
However…

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.687
the scores of the second round

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.231
are invalid.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.905
Your Excellency, I am not sure
I understand what you are saying.

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:18.823
Bailong's score--

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.495
It seems my words fell on closed ears.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.830
What did you say?

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.005
Look carefully.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.257
That is the score

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.927
the Ming chief envoy gave Joseon's dish.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.764
Just so the Ming could win,

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.975
he gave Joseon's dish
a ridiculously low score.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.857
However, Your Excellency,

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.027
the rule is that
we score each other's dishes.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.905
What is the matter with that?

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.251
Director Yu, do you truly not see it?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.002
We are the two judges of this competition.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.546
If we do not score the dishes honestly,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.174
what is the point of all this?

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.261
Your shallow trickery

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.513
is embarrassing your own cooks,

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.223
who did their best
to make outstanding dishes.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.849
Do you truly not realize that?

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.227
However--

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.478
In the first round,

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.982
the very person who was most ashamed
of winning with a dishonest ingredient

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.069
was the Ming cook, Tang Bailong.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.034
Yet you, the chief envoy,
decided to give such a dishonest score.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.912
What you did not only disgraced
the honor of the Ming cooks,

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.416
but also that of the Joseon cooks.

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:04.387
He asks how you wish to decide the winner.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.597
We will judge in a way

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:09.934
that eliminates all these problems.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.063
I wonder how.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.815
Listen carefully.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:19.402
The cooks of each nation
will taste and score their own dish.

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:24.073
Humans tend to be blind
to their own shortcomings.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.075
Score your food with that in mind,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.410
and that very score

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.163
will decide the winner
of the second round.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.832
He wants us to score ourselves?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.044
What on earth is he thinking?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.842
COURSE N° 9 PRESSURE-COOKED OGYETANG

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.380
First,

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.175
Joseon's Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:27.929
You made a new adaptation

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:30.139
of the Northern Capital roast duck
with an exquisite balance of flavors

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:34.143
that adhered to the theme
of "know" and "change."

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.813
How do you score that dish?

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:45.279
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to say,
but it's impossible to score.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.158
What? You cannot score your dish?

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.243
Why is that?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:56.165
It'd be a stretch to say
our Peking duck was perfect.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.418
But Cook Eom, Cook Maeng,

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.505
{\an8}Cook Min, Cook Sim, and Gil-geum

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:06.592
poured their sweat, hard work,
dedication, and hearts into the dish.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.262
We devoted ourselves to making this dish,

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.974
so how could we dare
evaluate it ourselves?

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.059
Your Majesty,

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:18.604
we can't evaluate and score our own dish.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.564
I apologize.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.154
I see.

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:30.992
Next.

00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:33.369
Ming's Chief Royal Cook Tang Bailong.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:39.959
You have captured profound enlightenment
in the lotus leaf wrap

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.170
and presented us
with Joseon's temple fare.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.338
It was truly a refined dish

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.174
that showed the noble grace
and skill of a Ming cook.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.179
How do you score your dish?

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.034
Tang Bailong also says
he is unable to score the temple dish

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:15.161
that he learned to make
from many Joseon monks.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:16.120
The truth is,

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.165
both dishes were equally good
in every aspect,

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:21.709
including taste, elegance, and appearance.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.795
Joseon's roast duck and Ming's temple dish

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.549
were clearly created by cooks who have
reached the highest level of skill.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.219
To judge the dishes on taste alone

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.846
is close to impossible.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.723
That is why

00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:39.644
I had the two cooks score the dishes
to assess their mindset.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.567
However,

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.277
it seems that both cooks

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.613
are evenly matched in that aspect as well.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.286
I believe

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.289
that both dishes in this round
proved to be equal,

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:01.874
which means

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.793
it is another tie.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:12.760
Do you have more to say?

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:19.559
If the third round is also a tie,
we will win the competition.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.143
This outcome is in our favor.

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:26.107
Your Excellency, I believe that you made
the most appropriate decision.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:32.071
He says he has nothing to add.

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:34.198
In that case, the third round

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.243
will be held here tomorrow
at the same time.

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.293
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.278
I lost.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.280
However,

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.199
it was a victory in its own way.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:18.868
No, I won.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.120
But it feels like

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.289
I kind of lost.

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.835
If our dishes were evaluated tomorrow,

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.630
the result would have been very different.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.175
I'm guessing you're saying
the Ming would've won, right?

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:36.719
As the temple food would have lingered
on their minds until the next day?

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:40.306
I focused heavily on the depth
and meaning of my dish,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.601
that I failed to captivate
their tongues at once.

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:47.104
That also is a shortcoming of mine.

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:49.815
I focused heavily
on captivating their tongues,

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.901
that I failed to add depth
and meaning to my dish.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.861
That's my shortcoming.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.199
You always have the last word.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.492
Because you keep talking.

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:05.247
I look forward to your final dish.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.585
Thank you.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:17.593
All right, let's get going.

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.762
What was that just now?

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.681
He lost, but he won?

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.266
Oh, well…

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.228
In this second round,

00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:29.980
Tang Bailong's dish touched the heart,

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.982
while ours captivated the taste buds.

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.653
If today's scoring had been done properly,
we would've won,

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:39.198
but his dish would've been the one
that remained on people's minds.

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.783
That's what we said.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.788
Then did you praise yourselves
while standing face-to-face?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.084
Well, we acknowledged each other

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:51.627
and praised ourselves too.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.753
Whatever the result,

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.673
the best cook in the Ming
acknowledged our chief royal cook.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:56.757
- Right?
- Right.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:00.177
- That alone is a great accomplishment.
- Yes.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.805
It's not just me. It's us.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.391
He acknowledged us.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:08.936
- Goodness, miss.
- Oh gosh.

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.646
Stop it. Let's go.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.109
- Greetings, Chief Eunuch.
- Greetings.

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:16.360
Well done, all of you.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.738
Cook Yeon, His Majesty wishes to see you.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.324
Right now?

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:27.163
Your Majesty.

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:30.207
Cook Yeon is here.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.919
So you asked to see me.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.214
Why do you look so upset?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.591
You did so well today.

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.426
Keep it brief and to the point.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.970
I don't have enough time
to prepare for tomorrow.

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:45.556
That is why I summoned you.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.313
Here.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.773
Are you personally offering me wine?

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.444
This is not wine.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:01.989
It is tea.

00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:03.991
I called you here
so you could have some rest.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.785
Go on and try it.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.880
A teacup holding the moon.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:21.342
How fascinating.

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:24.220
That is what you call "moon tea."

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:29.225
If you sit there and look into the teacup,
the tea reflects the moon in the sky.

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:34.730
It's mandarin leaf tea.

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.242
How do you feel?
Does it ease your tension?

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:47.660
Yes.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:52.790
It's almost like a warm consolation.

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.459
I was worried you looked too weak
to even hold the duck.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.713
How will you manage the remaining round
with a wounded hand?

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:03.217
I just can't do any delicate cutting,
but I can cook just fine.

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:04.760
"Fine"?

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.470
Maid Seo had to do the cutting for you.

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.473
You are too fearless.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.686
Why, of course I was afraid.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:18.065
But I put my trust in the sweat
and hard work the cooks had put into it.

00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:19.358
And that

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:21.986
came out to a tie, did it not?

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.488
That tie?

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.659
Since we're on the topic,

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:31.287
I assumed you changed the rule
in the middle of the competition

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.455
because you wanted a fair win.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.373
But then you went,

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.458
"Score your dish yourself."

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.920
How were we to decide a winner like that?

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:44.884
So that is why you are upset.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:49.096
We would've won
if only the scores were fair.

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.558
You are right.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.563
You did incredibly well today.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.317
The truth is,

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.069
I did not know
it would be this hard a competition.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.530
Just like Yu Kun,

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.033
I wanted to give you full marks

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:11.327
and Ming's dish one point.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:13.996
Your Majesty.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.205
It was my mistake

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:19.335
to risk the future of the nation
on a cooking competition.

00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:23.255
It is not yet too late.

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:25.257
Let us call off the third round.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.802
All I need to do is just bow
and apologize to the chief envoy.

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:31.513
No.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.765
I want to do the third round.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:36.977
So don't bow to the Ming.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.730
What do you mean?

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.068
I was angry at first

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:46.403
by how they looked down on Joseon.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:48.322
But now,

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:52.117
seeing Gil-geum, Cook Eom, Cook Maeng,

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.579
and the other cooks work so hard
and put in so much effort,

00:15:56.205 --> 00:16:00.876
and seeing how sincerely
the Ming cooks participated,

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:03.837
I genuinely want to win.

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:06.298
No.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.843
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:12.513
You mean it.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.765
I do.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.606
Has the pressure cooker lid arrived?

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.607
Not yet.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.401
But Mister Chun-saeng will come.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.069
I trust he will.

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.656
No one can criticize you.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.701
You put in more than enough effort so far.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.121
If things do not go well--

00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.706
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:49.216
Oh, that's hot!

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.511
Are you all right? Are you scalded?

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:54.179
No, I'm fine.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:56.765
This will not do.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:58.851
Chief Eunuch!

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.020
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.480
Inform those at Naeuiwon, Royal Clinic,
to treat Cook Yeon's hand promptly.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:04.898
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.818
I'm really okay.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.788
Promise me…

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.127
that you will never
let yourself get hurt again.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.380
Your pain…

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.593
brings greater pain to me.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.563
Your Majesty.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.864
How does it feel now?

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.075
It feels much better.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.994
This ointment will help even more.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:17:59.953
Thank you.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.331
Another tie?

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.294
It was just as you predicted,
Your Royal Highness.

00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:11.340
{\an8}How dare a mere chief envoy
do such a despicable thing?

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.260
There is a lot more gochogaru
than I thought, Your Highness.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:16.345
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.598
If there is too much,
you can always leave a sack with me.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.100
IM SONG-JAE
CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:25.229
You are cooks representing the Great Ming!

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.564
You brought nothing but humiliation!

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:31.026
How could we let two ties happen in a row?

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:38.283
- Cook Maeng.
- Yes.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.673
This is not just ordinary ginseng.

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.133
It is wild ginseng!

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.801
Wild ginseng?

00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.553
- Wild ginseng?
- What? Wild ginseng?

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:59.096
- My gosh.
- This is a precious ingredient.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.853
It is time to begin
the third and final round

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.063
of the competition
between Joseon and the Ming.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:13.986
Today's theme is…

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:17.948
tang for "soup," sam for "ginseng."

00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:19.908
You must make a soup containing ginseng.

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:28.083
You may begin cooking now.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:41.305
We must win today.

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:44.224
Let us begin cooking fo tiao qiang.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:45.350
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:47.227
It's time for our final dish.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:50.063
Let's start making ogolgye samgyetang,
Silkie ginseng chicken soup.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.108
Cook Min, please put the ogolgye
on the cutting board.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.193
Yes, Chief Royal Cook.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:55.152
- Cook Eom.
- Yes?

00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:57.529
Please skin three of them
and make a broth.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.114
Cook Sim, you be his sous-chef.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.158
What? What was that?

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.244
Oh, "sous-chef." It means to assist you.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.582
What if the lid does not arrive in time?

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:10.417
Right. What do we do then?

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.297
We'll go with Plan B.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.965
"Plant Bee"?

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.091
I mean an alternative.

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:20.427
The cast iron cauldron.

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:22.638
Though it will be harder.

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.348
I see we have an alternative.

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.183
That is great to hear.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.684
Yes, it is indeed.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:28.644
Okay then.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:32.105
Cook Maeng, please prepare
the green onions and garlic for the broth.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.232
Gil-geum, you be his sous-chef.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.067
- Very well.
- Okay.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:36.944
All right then.

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:38.737
Let's get started.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.098
Cook Eom, I need the skin
to be as wide as possible.

00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:07.140
I understand.

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:30.789
Bring the lu jin.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.958
{\an8}LU JIN: DEER TENDON FREQUENTLY USED
TO MAKE NOURISHING DISHES

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.459
{\an8}Hou tou gu.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.004
{\an8}HOU TOU GU: CHINESE NAME
FOR LION'S MANE MUSHROOM

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:38.964
Hai shen.

00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:41.842
{\an8}HAI SHEN: SEA CUCUMBER, A PREMIUM DELICACY
KNOWN AS THE WILD GINSENG OF THE SEA

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:43.635
That is…

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:49.891
Cook Sim.

00:21:57.232 --> 00:22:01.403
It looks like the Joseon cooks
are preparing an ogolgye soup.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:05.282
The Ming cooks are using ingredients
so incredibly rare

00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:08.243
that I cannot even fathom
what they are making.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.079
The first ingredient
Kong Wenli is preparing

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.915
is deer tendon soaked in oil for days.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.502
{\an8}It is one of the Eight Treasures,
the most precious ingredients.

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:20.005
What Bailong is preparing

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:22.299
is called lion's mane.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.843
Deer tendon and lion's mane?

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:29.306
That is the rare mushroom
that resembles a lion's mane, is it not?

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:34.770
You truly are a gourmet
who knows your ingredients.

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.397
There are also

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.901
sea cucumber, abalone,
bamboo shoots, dried scallops,

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:43.653
and even white ginseng,

00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:46.323
{\an8}which is said to be obtainable
only with ancestral blessing.

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:49.785
The soup your cooks are preparing…

00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:51.912
It cannot be.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.539
Yes.

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:57.834
A dish where precious, rare ingredients
are cooked together

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.837
for a long time with great care.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:03.215
It is said that the deep aroma

00:23:03.298 --> 00:23:07.344
even made a monk abandon his meditation
and jump over the wall to try it.

00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:09.471
{\an8}Thus, named fo tiao qiang,
or Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.765
{\an8}BULDOJANG:
A NOURISHING DISH WITH RARE DELICACIES

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:12.849
{\an8}So it is buldojang.

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:14.976
"Buldojang"?

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.525
Let's prepare the ingredients
to stuff the chicken.

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:22.526
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.953
- Peel it thinner.
- Okay.

00:23:50.053 --> 00:23:51.471
Tie the legs together tighter.

00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:52.597
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:55.642
There.

00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:09.906
{\an8}LIQUOR

00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:31.720
Let's wait just a bit more.

00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:36.766
- Cook Eom.
- Yes?

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.102
- Keep an eye on the broth for me.
- Sure.

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:41.104
Cook Maeng,
please make some jujube rice cakes.

00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:42.063
Leave them to me.

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:43.732
Gil-geum, get the morel for me.

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:44.941
Yes, miss.

00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:05.795
Mister Chun-saeng,
I really need you to come right now.

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:24.940
Forget about that Chun-saeng
or whatever his name is

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.775
and go with your Plant Bee!

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:29.903
He is right. We might fail
to complete the dish and lose.

00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:31.112
Let us go with Plant Bee!

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:39.371
I guess we have no choice.

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:42.874
Let's go with Plan B.

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.543
Cook Eom, we'll use the cauldron.

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:46.544
Very well.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.421
Cook Min, the lid.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.923
Right, Bong-sik.

00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:51.007
Hurry.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.220
There is a strange bird in the sky!

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.848
It is coming this way at great speed!

00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:00.767
On guard!

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.078
Get out of my way!

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:22.414
I have no time to waste with you.

00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.124
Oh goodness me.

00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:25.500
- Jang Chun-saeng!
- Oh, you!

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:28.378
The palace must be treating you well.
You look so much better.

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.256
- Did you bring it?
- Would I have come empty-handed?

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:33.216
Thank you.
The chief royal cook is waiting.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.551
You should head inside now.

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:37.095
- This way.
- Let us go.

00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.610
Mister Chun-saeng!

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:57.699
Jang Chun-saeng.

00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:01.202
Chief Royal Cook.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.079
You made it!

00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:06.541
Here you go.

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:14.090
What is that?

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:16.885
Who is that man?

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.137
He is a new palace attendant.

00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:21.890
He brought a cooking tool I ordered.

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:26.686
Let's see.

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.734
I said I would bring it to you, did I not?

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.402
I was waiting for you.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.779
Thank you so much.

00:27:35.862 --> 00:27:37.405
- Was I right on time?
- Yes.

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.948
It was perfect timing.

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:42.452
But the lid has weakened a bit
due to the damage,

00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:45.163
so you should keep the heat
as low as possible for safety.

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:48.375
What? But I need the heat
to be at maximum level.

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:51.419
Then go for it. What can you do?

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.922
Will it be very dangerous?

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:55.006
Well…

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.259
You will be in danger if you lose anyway.

00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:02.389
I'll trust in your skill,
Mister Chun-saeng.

00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:04.682
- I hope you win.
- I will.

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.142
- I should go now.
- Thank you.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.438
My gosh.

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.400
It's here!

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:24.160
- I need more firewood.
- Sure.

00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:25.286
No.

00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:28.415
This dish needs to be cooked on low heat.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.543
Relax, Ya Feixiu.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.361
My goodness, miss.

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.864
How much more firewood do we need?

00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:03.241
The flames are already so huge.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:06.244
{\an8}Water boils at 110°C
at 1.5 atmospheric pressures,

00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:08.204
{\an8}and that's enough to make it taste great.

00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:11.458
{\an8}But to ensure it tastes perfect,

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.127
{\an8}I'll raise the internal temperature
to 120°C at 2 atmospheric pressures.

00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:18.173
So you are saying we need more firewood.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.675
Yes. Just throw in everything we have.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:24.554
I might break my back carrying firewood.

00:29:24.637 --> 00:29:26.639
She says it is
to create the perfect taste,

00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:27.974
so go and get more firewood.

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:29.434
Yes, Man-su.

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.689
It seems you have changed a great deal
in the last few days.

00:29:35.648 --> 00:29:37.567
Stop talking and bring more firewood.

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:38.985
Okay.

00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:40.528
Cook Sim, wait for me.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.449
Please stay strong and hold on.

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.620
{\an8}IGAK, 30 MINUTES, LATER

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.980
He is concerned it will explode.

00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:17.315
Do not worry.

00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:19.192
My chief royal cook
knows what she is doing.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:28.827
My goodness.

00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:33.957
It did it!

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:35.667
It held up two atmospheric pressures.

00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:38.086
I knew Mister Chun-saeng could do it.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.306
Oh my, miss.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.993
It looks like their dish is done already.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.745
That is strange.

00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:14.330
How could it be done so soon?

00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:21.045
It looks like the Ming
is far from being done.

00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:26.467
This is the power of science.

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:28.970
It's much faster, isn't it?
And it tastes better too.

00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:31.180
It was worth the hard work.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:32.640
All right.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.059
Now for the last step.

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:41.190
It's a new form of samgyetang

00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:44.485
where you can enjoy
the nutritious ogolgye from skin to meat.

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.947
When it comes to
slowly cooked fo tiao qiang,

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:51.784
the last touch completes the taste.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:59.584
Dumplings made with glutinous rice
and ogolgye skin

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.419
are lightly parboiled in the broth.

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.841
Liquor is poured on a plate
covered in salt.

00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:14.390
Maid Seo, we must hurry.

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:18.019
The minced meat is piped into the morels.

00:32:19.854 --> 00:32:23.900
A dragon carving,
symbolizing power, is added.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:31.366
On top of a layer
made with seasoned ogolgye meat

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.576
go the dumpling, mushroom, and ginseng.

00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:38.164
To complete the dish,
the salt is set aflame to warm the bowl.

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:46.506
To complete the dish,
wild ginseng broth is poured around it.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.803
The crunchy, savory nurungji
is an extra touch.

00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:59.519
The dishes from both sides are complete.

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:02.772
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.958
Today, we will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks first.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.511
Oh, right.

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:37.890
You tap the nurungji
with your spoon to break it,

00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:41.894
and eat it with the dumpling,
meat, and broth.

00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:54.323
What is this dish called?

00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:55.700
This dish is called

00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:58.077
wild ginseng-infused ogolgye samgyetang.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.791
I stuffed the ogolgye with 100-year-old
cheonjongsam, premium wild ginseng,

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.627
and cooked them in a pressure cooker
with medicinal herb broth,

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:09.797
which enhanced the texture of the meat
and the deep flavor of the broth.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:12.925
I also added a unique flavor to the dish

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:15.678
with morel stuffed with minced ogolgye
and nurungji.

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:26.522
The aroma is of a herbal chicken soup,
but it is shaped like a dumpling.

00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:33.654
He says it does not look refined.

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:39.368
This is "oat sheen,"
an invigorating dish favored

00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:40.787
in palaces of the Western world.

00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:46.000
I suppose you do not know much
about Western food.

00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.217
"Oat sheen"?

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.804
This is oat sheen?

00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:00.348
I know.

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.009
A phoenix!

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:58.281
I am an immortal riding a phoenix!

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.492
The ogolgye meat is unbelievably tender,

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:05.204
and it is presented neatly
so there is no need to separate the bone.

00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:06.539
Each time I taste the broth,

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:09.542
the aroma of the cheonjongsam
and green onions

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.002
spreads subtly throughout.

00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:15.006
It almost feels as if
it warmly comforts my heart.

00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:20.094
Is this truly a ginseng chicken soup

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.096
made with Silkie?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.224
The meat melts away in my mouth,

00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:28.186
and the broth is incredibly rich and deep.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.480
I feel the warmth
and the energy build up inside of me,

00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:34.609
which is definitely the effect of ginseng.

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:38.362
However, the taste is completely new.

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:42.950
This is truly a magnificent dish!

00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:56.797
It is delicious.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.018
Now, we will taste the dish
made by the Ming cooks.

00:37:17.693 --> 00:37:19.987
What is this dish called?

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:25.952
It is buldojang.

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:27.870
It is made with delicacies
from land and sea,

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.039
including deer tendon,
lion's mane, white ginseng,

00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:32.833
sea cucumber, pine mushrooms, and more.

00:37:36.045 --> 00:37:37.338
He says each bite will taste different,

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.840
as the ingredients will bring out
their flavors in your mouth.

00:37:42.551 --> 00:37:45.054
This is a dish
truly worthy of the Great Ming!

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:44.405
There is a reason
this is called a food of the gods.

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:46.324
There is no need for words.

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.492
This is truly a taste

00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:50.536
beyond compare.

00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:21.567
This concludes
the tasting of the third and final round.

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.244
To ensure

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.413
the third round is scored fairly,

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:36.582
the cooks will taste each other's food

00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:38.376
and score it.

00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:40.920
Each cook can give up to ten points,

00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:43.172
which would make the full score 30 points.

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:01.232
He says that he has accepted
His Excellency's scoring method

00:40:01.315 --> 00:40:03.234
to apologize for the prior
unsavory scoring process,

00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:05.528
and for the cooks
to score each other fairly.

00:40:12.868 --> 00:40:15.955
Now, you may taste each other's food.

00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:52.366
This buldojang is no joke.

00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:55.202
We wouldn't have stood a chance
without the pressure cooker.

00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:57.496
You are right.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.582
Having a bite of this dish
I had only heard of

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.792
makes me feel energized already.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:05.087
Our ogolgye samgyetang
is just as nourishing as this.

00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.339
They did use rare ingredients,

00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:09.175
but the taste is not that impressive.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.600
Why won't he eat?

00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:19.727
He can't score unless he tastes it.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.896
I have been watching him,

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.148
and he does not seem to eat at all.

00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:25.649
The maids say

00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:28.194
he cooks without even tasting the food.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.446
He doesn't taste the food?

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:32.490
It can't be.

00:41:34.283 --> 00:41:35.701
Is he anorexic?

00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:39.997
What is that?

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.124
It's an illness
that makes one unable to eat.

00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:43.083
That makes no sense.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.669
How could a cook have such an illness?

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:46.754
I've seen it before.

00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:49.757
Once their cooking reached
a certain level,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.467
they couldn't eat any food.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:54.762
An anorexic cook.

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.306
If he cannot eat…

00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.558
How will he score our food?

00:42:00.142 --> 00:42:03.395
Why has that cook not tasted the food?

00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:09.902
Ever since Kong Wenli reached
the highest level of cooking skill,

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:13.239
he has not been able to eat any food.

00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:15.491
He has the ability
to create the best flavors

00:42:15.574 --> 00:42:17.826
without ever tasting them.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:18.953
What?

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:21.330
How will he score the food then?

00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:24.917
He cannot score what he cannot taste.

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:30.381
I wonder how this will affect the scores.

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:37.012
Yesterday, you reprimanded me
for not scoring honestly.

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.645
He says you can have them score
as fairly as you wish, Your Majesty.

00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:51.902
He looks guilty for trying to eat.

00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:56.448
He might eat
if the food isn't plated nicely.

00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.843
Cook Yeon, what are you doing?

00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:17.678
What are you doing?

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.847
He has to taste it to score it.

00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:22.975
My goodness.

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.694
He says the chief royal cook must be
perplexed after tasting Ming's dish.

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.909
Chief Royal Cook.

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:54.423
To make food is joy for the cook,

00:43:54.506 --> 00:43:56.592
and to taste
is joy for the people who eat.

00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:59.470
That's what makes cooking rewarding,
isn't it?

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.305
To be honest,

00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:04.266
it tastes extra good when everything
is thrown together like this.

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.269
Regardless of the result,

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.188
as a cook,

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:13.233
I present you with this food
with the hope that you'll also be happy.

00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:36.674
Why do you care so much about taste?

00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:38.133
Do not be complicated.

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.804
So what if you cannot cook well?

00:44:41.887 --> 00:44:45.641
Nothing tastes better

00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:48.268
than when you throw everything in
and cook it together.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.105
Try it.

00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.899
Come on. Try it.

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:02.241
It is delicious.

00:45:02.324 --> 00:45:03.534
It is so good.

00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:04.511
This is…

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:08.348
the taste I had forgotten

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.019
and missed for so many years.

00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:19.359
I once was left in shock
after tasting my grandmother's food

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:23.155
that was made with all sorts of
ingredients thrown in together.

00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:25.616
For many years,

00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:27.659
I tried to cook something
that tasted better,

00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:31.455
but nothing I made ever tasted like it.

00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:33.832
Since then,

00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:37.169
I have gained the ability to cook
without tasting the food.

00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:38.295
However…

00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:42.591
the more I cooked,

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.261
the harder it became for me to eat.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.816
He says you recreated

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.778
the taste of his grandmother's food.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:19.461
He says he cannot
call himself the best cook,

00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:23.090
for he cannot surpass
his grandmother's cooking.

00:47:32.432 --> 00:47:35.936
The most important virtue of a wise man
is said to be benevolence.

00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:38.438
To care and be considerate of others.

00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:42.901
I made this out of consideration for you,
Cook Kong Wenli.

00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:46.530
The dish your grandmother made for you

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:49.324
was probably made with the same heart.

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.632
I see it now.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:09.219
A cook who can bring joy
to both themselves and others

00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.346
is a true wise man.

00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:24.151
He says that he has lost
to the chief royal cook.

00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:41.168
How is this possible?

00:49:00.979 --> 00:49:04.274
I will announce
the result of the third round,

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.318
where the cooks scored each other's food.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.412
First, we will reveal the score
given by the Joseon cooks for Ming's dish.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.210
It is 27 points.

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:30.509
Next, we will reveal the score
given by the Ming cooks for Joseon's dish.

00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:38.642
It is 28 points.

00:49:42.187 --> 00:49:43.313
Miss!

00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:46.108
Cook Eom! Oh my!

00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.712
It was such a pleasure
to compete against such great cooks.

00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:08.588
Thank you for the generous score.

00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:10.549
Thank you.

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:13.593
I hope

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:17.764
to compete against you properly one day.

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.975
Just one cook against another.

00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:21.059
Anytime.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.442
What is this?

00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:31.820
Where I'm from, this is a greeting.

00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:33.196
We call it a handshake.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.406
"Handshake"?

00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:37.451
Handshake.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.875
It was a great match.

00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:46.501
I learned a lot.

00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:50.881
I also realized
I have a lot more to learn.

00:50:54.634 --> 00:50:56.386
- Thank you.
- I learned a lot.

00:50:57.554 --> 00:51:00.432
It looks like we have a final winner.

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:06.480
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:51:21.828 --> 00:51:23.997
He says he will relinquish the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng as promised

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.374
and return to the Ming with just one
tribute item to show their appreciation.

00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:28.418
And what is that?

00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:49.314
He says he will offer the chief royal cook
to the Emperor as a tribute woman.

00:51:50.565 --> 00:51:51.566
What?

00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.861
You want the chief royal cook
as a tribute woman?

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:58.114
What is this utter nonsense?

00:51:58.198 --> 00:51:59.282
You've got to be kidding me.

00:52:00.158 --> 00:52:02.077
He's asking to take me as a tribute woman?

00:52:33.066 --> 00:52:34.234
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.236
Your Majesty!

00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:38.405
Your Majesty!

00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:42.117
He is the chief envoy from the Ming…

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.743
He struck him with his head!

00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:47.581
How could this happen?

00:52:57.632 --> 00:52:58.466
Blood?

00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:00.886
I am bleeding!

00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.431
How dare the King of Joseon

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:08.351
behave this way
toward the envoy of the Emperor?

00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.436
Oh dear.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.773
I only meant to show you
the Joseon greeting.

00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:17.569
Are you all right?

00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:26.494
He says in any case, he will take
the chief royal cook with him.

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.497
Guards, take her.

00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:32.208
- Oh no!
- No!

00:53:33.126 --> 00:53:34.377
Miss.

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:38.673
Director Yu,

00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:40.383
it seems

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.346
that you brought
far too few attendants with you

00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:46.681
to take my chief royal cook
as a tribute woman.

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:50.852
What?

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:53.313
You should have brought

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:56.274
at least an army of a hundred thousand

00:53:56.358 --> 00:53:58.234
to make it worth my time.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.415
He asks if you will dare challenge
the envoy of the Emperor of the Ming.

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:14.834
Anytime.

00:54:24.886 --> 00:54:28.056
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager has arrived.

00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:06.678
What in the world

00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:09.139
is happening in this place?

00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:10.098
Grandmother.

00:55:10.181 --> 00:55:12.517
I was bidding the Ming envoy farewell,

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.102
and there was a minor misunderstanding.

00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:15.687
A misunderstanding, you say?

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.648
I do not know
what that misunderstanding could be,

00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:21.026
but Your Majesty,

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:23.486
as the ruler of a nation,

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.323
you must never act recklessly.

00:55:27.907 --> 00:55:29.325
Yes, Grandmother.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.953
I have something to inquire
of Envoy Yu Kun.

00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:35.248
You have come as an envoy
of a great nation.

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.916
Why is it that you have
set aside your official duties

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.754
and suggested
such an imprudent competition?

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:43.048
I have the Emperor's command to demand

00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:47.385
the right to harvest Joseon ginseng
and take tribute women--

00:55:47.469 --> 00:55:49.763
How dare you, Yu Kun!

00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:57.896
"How dare you, Yu Kun"?

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.648
I now see

00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:05.236
that your insolence knows no bounds.

00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:08.948
Both the King of Joseon

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:13.745
and his grandmother have lost their minds.

00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:18.875
An insult to me
is an insult to the Emperor himself.

00:56:18.958 --> 00:56:23.588
Do you all wish to be punished at once?

00:56:26.257 --> 00:56:27.175
Yu Kun.

00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:35.767
Do you know what this is?

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:43.942
It is a letter from my aunt

00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:46.611
and the late Emperor's second wife,

00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:48.738
Consort Yeon.

00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:52.450
Do you still dare insist your Emperor

00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:56.412
requested the right to harvest our ginseng
and our women as tribute?

00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:03.253
So the aunt of the
Grand Royal Queen Dowager of Joseon

00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:07.090
is the late Emperor's second wife,

00:57:07.173 --> 00:57:08.758
- Consort Yeon?
- Yes.

00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:17.350
I have deceived the Emperor
and dishonored the Ming imperial family.

00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:25.442
He begs for your forgiveness
and benevolent grace.

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:28.820
Then let us return
to the original matter at hand.

00:57:28.903 --> 00:57:30.572
You should keep your promise.

00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:40.373
He says he will supply
the requested items at any time.

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:41.833
Can I

00:57:43.042 --> 00:57:44.419
trust your words?

00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:59.684
He says he swears on the heavens
to keep his promise.

00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:16.326
He thanks you for the hospitality
and says he will take his leave.

00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:21.331
There is no need to hurry.

00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:26.127
Be sure to take the tribute items
we prepared for you.

00:58:27.795 --> 00:58:29.088
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:33.676
My lord.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.470
I appreciate it.

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:37.305
Well done.

00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:40.433
It was very delicious.

00:58:55.573 --> 00:58:58.826
What brought you all the way here,
Grandmother?

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.328
Your Majesty.

00:59:00.995 --> 00:59:03.373
Why did you act so rashly?

00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:07.210
Matters could have gotten out of hand

00:59:07.919 --> 00:59:10.838
if I had not requested
a letter from the Ming imperial family.

00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:13.299
I apologize, Grandmother.

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.970
The nation does not belong to you alone.

00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:19.514
Does it?

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.812
I will be more cautious.

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:26.896
Your Royal Highness.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.483
I think it is best to leave it at this.

00:59:34.279 --> 00:59:35.280
Your Majesty.

00:59:35.822 --> 00:59:39.409
I have a request.

00:59:41.828 --> 00:59:43.204
Please tell me what it is.

00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:45.415
Grand Prince Jinmyeong

00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:49.669
is quite curious
about the chief royal cook's food.

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:52.755
Would you allow him

00:59:53.548 --> 00:59:55.883
the chance to taste her food?

00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:57.885
Is that so?

00:59:58.595 --> 00:59:59.887
Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:03.725
Then I will arrange a meal tomorrow.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.021
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.108
Now, hurry and bring an end
to the competition.

01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:13.860
Yes, Grandmother.

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:38.760
{\an8}GRAND PRINCE JESAN'S RESIDENCE

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.309
What on earth do you wish to do with this?

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.395
The plan has already been set in motion.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.648
His Majesty will have his natsura,
midday meal,

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.232
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong tomorrow.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.360
- Cook Yeon.
- Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:58.780
His Majesty will have his natsura
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong tomorrow.

01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:01.824
I'll prepare buttered and roasted
whole ogolgye with ginseng.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.328
They will be having
roasted chicken with ginseng.

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:07.914
Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:12.752
Are you concerned because he will play
an important part in our plan?

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:17.632
Are you saying
you do not mind sacrificing him?

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:19.967
If it means we can eliminate
the chief royal cook

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:23.012
and make His Majesty explode with fury.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:25.640
However,

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.767
poison leaves a trace.

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:31.604
Only when a poison is a poison.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.732
However, this right here

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.485
is not originally a poison.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.280
A poison that is not a poison?

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.582
What is the matter, Your Highness?

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:52.917
To be honest,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.879
I expected you
to betray me at a certain point.

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.674
The position of a young king's consort

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.718
is quite an enviable one.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.640
You are the reason
I was able to live decently.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.185
That is enough for me.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.646
When the time comes,

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.149
I will make you my official spouse

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.942
so you can live freely.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.322
{\an8}GANGNYEONGJEON

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:27.160
{\an8}Thoroughly investigate the military camps
all around Joseon,

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:30.747
focusing especially on those
who have deserted or transferred units.

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:33.791
Identify them all.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.837
Is it to find out
those who attacked you, Your Majesty?

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.214
No.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.300
Treachery.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:48.014
I must uncover who harbors such a heart.

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.683
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will do as you command.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.481
This feels so good.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.859
I wish I could just lie down forever.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.236
- Don't you?
- I do.

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:05.114
I am tired,

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.825
but I really enjoyed the competition.

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:11.704
I will never forget it
for the rest of my life.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.415
I could never. I almost died.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.126
I even almost got dragged away
to the Ming.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.295
Oh my goodness.

01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:20.755
That would have been terrible.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:24.717
Come to think of it,
did we save our country today?

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.178
We almost lost all our ginseng.

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:31.057
Seeing that I'm worrying
about such things,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.351
I guess I've really become
a Joseon person.

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.863
This room.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.410
Gil-geum, Cook Eom, Cook Maeng.

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.120
His Majesty.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.624
I guess you all grew on me.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:03.130
MANGUNROK

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:50.219
Well done, Cook Yeon.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.079
How do you feel?

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:20.833
Thanks to your concern,
I went back to Naeuiwon.

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:28.299
They said
I don't have much longer to live.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:29.800
What?

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.178
That's what I thought they'd say.

01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:35.473
I'm just a bit overworked,
but nothing's wrong with me.

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:39.644
How could you joke about that?

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:41.145
Did I scare you?

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:42.188
I'm sorry.

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:45.024
Then what about your hand?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.902
Oh, I received acupuncture,

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:49.946
and my condition got better.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.947
"Condison"?

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.908
It's in a much better state.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.535
Then are you in

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.496
a good enough condison to cook?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.123
Of course. There's no problem.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.667
I'll make sure

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.087
to prepare a really great meal.

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:14.929
Is this where you'll dine
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.305
Yes.

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.851
The special meal for today is battered
roasted whole chicken, correct?

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:24.355
Yes, it's buttered and roasted
whole ogolgye with ginseng.

01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:27.608
He is young, so prepare the…

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.736
What was it? Macrong? Serve those as well.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.779
Okay.

01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:37.868
This is the perfect place
to have a natsura with a younger brother.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.453
It would also be

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:43.457
a good place for us to eat in private.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.627
In private?

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.588
Would you not like that?

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:54.010
If you are preparing a dish, Your Majesty,

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:57.513
I will gladly taste it.

01:06:57.596 --> 01:06:58.556
What?

01:06:58.639 --> 01:06:59.974
Me? Cook?

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.227
You dare tell me to set foot in a kitchen?

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:05.521
It's a joke, Your Majesty.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:06.981
I won the competition,

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:11.527
so please accept my humble jest
with grace, Your Majesty.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:14.947
Fine.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.533
I'll get going then.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.285
Wait.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:25.332
I am not done yet.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.127
What is it?

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.347
Open it.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.565
This is…

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.401
It is a new cook's attire.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:02.536
It's beautiful. Look at the colors.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.997
Well? Do you think
this is a flattering color for me?

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.625
"Flattening collar"?

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:10.252
I'm asking if the colors suit me.

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.299
But…

01:08:18.302 --> 01:08:21.430
I must leave once I find Mangunrok.

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:23.099
So why are you giving me this?

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.312
Who says you can leave?

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.480
Even if you do leave,

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.316
you will still need a cook's attire,
will you not?

01:08:35.402 --> 01:08:36.737
A cook's attire.

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.906
Right.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.158
Thank you for this.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:43.577
One more thing.

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.205
After my meal with Grand Prince Jinmyeong,

01:08:46.705 --> 01:08:48.124
meet me at Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.211
Oh, but I have a prior engagement.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:53.629
A prior engagement?

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.965
With whom?

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.592
The Ming cooks asked to see me.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.011
Do you want to see them again
when you almost died?

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:05.141
I want to give them a gift
and say my last goodbye.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.100
I will not allow it.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.269
But…

01:09:09.186 --> 01:09:10.521
Your Majesty.

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:18.821
Then make it brief

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.031
and come to Jangwonseo.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.368
Okay, I will.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.162
Do not be late.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.456
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.425
Today's natgeotsang, daytime meal,

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.801
is roasted whole ogolgye.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.305
We'll cook it the same way
as the Peking duck.

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:46.515
You will serve chicken again?

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.893
There is no "again"
when it comes to His Majesty's meals.

01:09:48.976 --> 01:09:50.311
You are so silly.

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:52.521
We should hurry up and get started.

01:09:52.605 --> 01:09:55.441
I have never seen
a cook's attire in this color.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.693
Of course you have not.

01:09:57.776 --> 01:10:00.613
His Majesty gifted it to her.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.572
Does it suit me?

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:03.949
- Of course it does.
- Good.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.119
I will get the ingredients
to fill the chicken with.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.872
- Okay.
- I will go get two ogolgyes.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:12.875
- Cook Min, please get some suyu for me.
- Yes, of course.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:16.003
- Cook Sim, please get me some firewood.
- Sure.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:23.052
Shall I clean the ginseng now?

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:27.640
Jinmyeong.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.727
This is the first time
we are dining together.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.021
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:36.023
It is an honor.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.778
You can call me brother when we are alone.

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.738
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:46.533
I mean, Brother.

01:10:48.702 --> 01:10:50.412
I see you feel uncomfortable around me.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:56.043
We should do this more often from now on.

01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:59.255
Can we really? Do you mean that?

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:00.381
I do.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.424
Are you that pleased?

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:07.221
Yes. Everyone in the palace
is praising the chief royal cook.

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:10.182
I wanted to taste everything
that was served

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.184
in the competition against the Ming.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.104
I am pleased to see you are excited.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.984
We shall make time to eat everything.

01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:21.694
Yes.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.780
Your Majesty, the natgeotsang is ready.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.225
It smells light

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.852
but rich at the same time.

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:57.313
Just looking at it makes my mouth water,
Your Majesty.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.440
This is roasted whole ogolgye

01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:01.066
made by stuffing the chicken
with glutinous rice,

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.235
jujube, chestnuts, and milkvetch root,

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:07.031
and roasting it by hanging
just as we did for the Peking duck.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:10.159
Then this time,
did you roast the ogolgye whole?

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:11.785
Yes.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:14.997
But I coated the outside with butter…

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.253
I coated it with suyu
and stuffed it with ginseng.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.510
Do you eat this too?

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.096
It is bitter, but it is a root vegetable
that is good for you,

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.431
so chew it carefully.

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:43.776
This was made with ground mustard seeds,

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.236
salt, vinegar, and honey.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.822
It's a Joseon-style mustard sauce.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.742
"Mustache sauce"?

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.954
Take the chicken and dip it.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.748
Oh, dip and eat.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:12:58.665
Exactly.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:04.797
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.155
Dip and eat.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.086
The skin is chewy

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.004
and the meat is moist.

01:13:57.015 --> 01:14:00.102
I have never tasted
anything like this in my life.

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:03.230
It is chewy, light, and flavorful.

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:07.151
This would have been a dish
worthy of presenting at the competition.

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:11.280
You are as skilled as I heard.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.995
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:20.706
Jinmyeong.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.082
Try this.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.584
Dip and eat.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.002
Dip and eat it.

01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.797
Is it good?

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.799
Yes, it is delicious.

01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:35.512
I was worried for no reason.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.431
If His Majesty is the man
I believe him to be,

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.892
the purge might not happen.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:42.269
Wait.

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:45.606
Did I change the course of history?

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:52.946
Ginseng?

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.783
When did you prepare this for us?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:01.830
I thought Ya Feixiu could use it
to create a new dish.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:03.540
Thank you.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.544
We, too, are grateful for these.

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:12.841
Are you not traveling
with the chief envoy?

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.510
With his permission,

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.513
the three of us will go our separate ways

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.182
to study and improve our cooking skills.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.019
That's amazing.

01:15:24.102 --> 01:15:25.562
I'm envious.

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:29.983
We should compete again someday.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.151
Properly.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.111
I'd love to,

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.197
if we have the chance.

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:37.157
You taught me a lot.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:38.825
I wish you happiness.

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.037
Travel safely.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.330
I wish you peace.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.670
Chief Royal Cook.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:53.757
I am not interested
in another nation's politics,

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.009
but do relay this message to your king.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:02.683
The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.185
and when you sleep,

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:08.397
be sure to lock the latch securely.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.818
Okay.

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:15.696
Is that all you want me to tell him?

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:19.825
Okay.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:22.536
Then let us say our farewells.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.093
- Thank you.
- I learned a lot.

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:39.136
Thank you.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:52.608
"The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.612
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely"?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:17:00.240
You should have asked him what he meant.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:02.326
Yes, you should have.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.411
I have a bad feeling about it
for some reason.

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:08.373
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.047
- Miss!
- Chief Royal Cook…

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:16.757
Your Royal Highness.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.260
You will never cook for His Majesty again.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:23.805
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.474
My son Jinmyeong

01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:28.644
is at death's door
after he ate the chicken you made for him!

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:34.274
Your Royal Highness.

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:37.569
Are you saying Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is unconscious?

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.404
Why would the food I made…

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.740
You should know better than anyone.

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.659
Take this wench away this instant!

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:45.494
I will interrogate her myself.

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:47.204
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.332
- Chief Royal Cook.
- Wait. Your Royal Highness.

01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.376
- Oh no, miss!
- Chief Royal Cook!

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:55.462
- Your Royal Highness, it can't be!
- Miss!

01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:58.674
- There must be a misunderstanding!
- Chief Royal Cook!

01:17:58.757 --> 01:17:59.800
Your Royal Highness…

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:09.935
Chaos must be unfolding by now.

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:10.852
Yes, Your Grace.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.230
The Queen Dowager is furious,

01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:15.232
and she will interrogate
the chief royal cook herself.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:17.859
Very well.
What about the female physician?

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.821
I brought her out in secret
and sent her to that place.

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:21.822
Well done.

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.326
I wish I could see the face

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.121
of the chief royal cook
as she is being interrogated and tortured.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.171
Your Royal Highness, I'm innocent!

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.424
Something isn't right!

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:41.633
Shut your mouth!

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:44.761
Until the wench confesses the truth,

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:45.971
torture her!

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.097
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.224
No, wait. Your Royal Highness.

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:50.726
Your Royal Highness!

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.321
GOCHO

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:37.272
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:40.442
{\an8}Are you implying
that I was behind all this?

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:45.655
{\an8}You know better than anyone
that I wouldn't do such a thing.

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.449
{\an8}Please prove my innocence.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:51.161
{\an8}This is not His Majesty's doing.

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.121
{\an8}I guess it would not be so bad
to stand by and watch.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.582
{\an8}It means the time has come.

01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:58.251
{\an8}I do not want you to leave.

01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:00.337
{\an8}We must silence that female physician.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.589
{\an8}Did Consort Kang put you up to it?

01:20:02.672 --> 01:20:04.800
{\an8}If you wish to punish me,

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.552
{\an8}bring forth the evidence.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.471
{\an8}No!

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:18.063
