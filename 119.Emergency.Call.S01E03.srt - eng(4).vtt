Our job requires us to be the bigger person and listen to whoever calls.

It's tough work, constantly being the listener.

I didn't realize you knew more than just English.

I know only words that often get misunderstood.

Still, that's impressive.

I didn't realize how difficult it would be going through an interpreter.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.910
It's hard enough trying to help foreigners figure out where they are.

With the added translation time, communicating takes twice as long.

I'd advise you not to waste your time.

with the help of an interpreter.

That's why I'd like to speak to someone who can tell us.

To put it bluntly,

someone on Squad 3 entertains these calls for far too long.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.410
I understand your logic, Niijima-san.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:15.100
But can a call be considered "junk" or "irrelevant" so easily?

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.100
- Well...
- If we rely on a manual

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.520
and prioritize absolute efficiency,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.160

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.660
Times sure have changed.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.550
I'm glad I asked for your advice, Kid.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.560
Please tell us where to send the ambulance.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.400
Dear, I called because you said you were hurting!

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.630
- I don't need an ambulance, really.
- But...

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.780
Well, Ma'am, is that your husband behind you?

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.600
- Yes.
- May I speak to him?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.560
They want to speak to you. Here.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.810
Hello?

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.350
You don't need to send an ambulance.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.520
- I see. You're feeling better now, Sir?
- Yes.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.850
I'm sorry. She always calls for the smallest things...

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.200
It's all right.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.150
But, Sir, your wife is calling because she is worried about you.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.210
How about you put her at ease by scheduling a checkup or talking it out with her?

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.160
You're entirely right, yes. Once again, sorry for the trouble.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.830
No worries, Sir.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.680
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.960
Help, my friend has fainted!

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.920
- Is this...
- Spanish.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.420
Hold on please.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.810
- Spanish, please.
- Apologies.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.090
We have received too many inquiries at this time.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.180
Please try calling again later.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.080
- What?
- I didn't realize that was possible.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.010
With foreign tourism on the rise,

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.790
we aren't the only ones using this interpretation service.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.200
Are you listening? What's going on?

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.950
Just a moment please.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.740
What should I do?

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.100
I'll take the call.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.070

- I know.

[Transfer call]

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:59.140
Hello. I know only a little Spanish. Do you speak English?

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.910
Just a little bit.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.840
Okay.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.570
I'm going to speak in English.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.370
So if you can't understand, let me know.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.970
What's your emergency? Fire or ambulance?

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.220
Ambulance. My friend who is traveling with me

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.400
has a very bad stomachache and cannot move!

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.860
- How old is she?
- 35.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.670
Right, we'll send an ambulance.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.670
- Where are you now?
- Úlcera duodenal.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.340
- What?
- Úlcera duodenal.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.400
I don't know the English word.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.660
But she had that condition half a year ago.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.840
Maybe this time, too.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.480
- "Urcera duodenall"...
- Yeah.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.260
What happened?

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.110
She's saying her friend may be relapsing,

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.130
but she knows the affliction's name only in Spanish.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.600
- I see.
- Narrow down their location first.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.100
I'm sending an ambulance. Where are you?

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.990
Chinatown. I don't know anything else.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.050
Somewhere in Chinatown?

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.900
That's not enough to pinpoint their location.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.910
- What do you see nearby?
- Please, hurry!

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.880
Please calm down and look carefully.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.460
A hotel! She collapsed outside our hotel!

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.830
A hotel? What's the name?

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.260
I don't know.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.800
She said her friend collapsed outside their hotel,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.860
but she doesn't know the hotel's name.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.430
She doesn't know the hotel's name? How is that possible?

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.920
Could it be...

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.860
It turns out there really was a hotel in that area.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.670
It's actually a hostel being run without permission.
[The Hotel]

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.890
Maybe it was that hostel.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.370
It's within the call radius as well.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.140
There was a lion statue right by the alleyway to that place.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.480
Do you see anything near that hotel?

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.140
No, nothing is around here.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.060
Are you sure? No lion statue?

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.030
- "Lion"?
- Yeah.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.300
No, I don't see it.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.700
Got it.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.410
- She said there isn't one.
- What?

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.870
Oh, are you all right?

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.030
- What happened?
- Blood! She's vomiting blood!

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.780
What do I do? Come quickly!

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.910
- She said her friend vomited blood.
- What?

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.500
Calm down. Don't touch the blood.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.400
The ambulance is on the way.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.320
Niijima-san, give this a listen.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.250
- Kaneshita-san, your phone...
- I got permission.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.200
Is this what she said earlier?

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.400
Úlcera duodenal.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.070
- This is it! What does it mean?
- She has a duodenal ulcer.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.970
If she's vomiting blood, it could be serious.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:32.800
What should I do? Help!

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.000
I know, just hold on.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.790
If that's the only hotel in the area, should we send an ambulance there?

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.260
There could be other unauthorized hostels we don't know about.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.280
True...

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.390
And if we're wrong, we'll only cause more confusion.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.580
Pinpointing their location now would get an ambulance there sooner.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.400
But what else can we do?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.100
All right, back to your stations, folks.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.200
You've got other calls to respond to.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.180
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.170
Kasuhara-san,

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:14.300
was the hostel you found the other day far from a busy street?

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.900
No, it was an alleyway, but there was activity close by.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.820
I have a request. Repeat this Japanese word.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.580
"Tasukete."

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.550
It means "help me" in Japanese.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.400
Do you understand?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.450
"Ta-su-ke-te."

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.820
- "Tasukete"?
- Yes, shout the word.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.020
And I promise somebody will help you.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.840
- "Tasukete"?
- Yes.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.200
Continue. Keep shouting.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.600
Help me! Help me! Help me!

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.250
Help me! Help me! Help me!

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.850
Help me! Help me!

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:15.570
Help me! Help me! Help me!

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.700
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.320
Well, this lady handed the phone to me.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.000
This is 119.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.040
Could you help us locate this individual

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.300
so we can send an ambulance?

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.300
I see. That's why...

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.720
- Someone’s passing by.
- Okay, I will do what I can.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.200
Is there an electrical pole somewhere nearby?

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.900
An electrical pole? Yes, there is.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.720
There should be an address written there. Could you confirm?

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.450
Yes. One moment.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.280
Let's see... It says we're at 4-1-3 Yamashita.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.090
At 4-1-3 Yamashita, yes?

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.250
Thank you very much.
[Dispatch]

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.080
The ambulance is headed your way shortly.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.590
Could you possibly stay with the person until the ambulance arrives?

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.300
- Thank you.
- Did you give her some advice, Dojima-san?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.590
No, I just made some small talk.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.100
I knew I could count on you.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.130
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:35.430
So, the caller was calling from that unauthorized hostel after all.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.400
- Seems like it.
- Then why wasn't the statue there?

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.800
Great question.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.300
It may be because of the way I asked them.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.030
Though this may technically be a lion,

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:54.200
I don't think many Westerners would identify it as one.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.800
I suppose not.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.060
Differences in language sure are fascinating.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.630
I should have noticed this yesterday. Sorry.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.300
You don't need to apologize.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.900
If anything, you're the one who helped me.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.050
No, b-but...

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.610
I couldn't handle this case alone.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.380
Thank you for your help.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.190
No, thank you.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.300
Well, great work today, you two.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.400
You too, Ma'am.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.600
Oh, Team Leader?

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.010
"I'm scared. This manju terrifies me."

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.600
"Someone, bring the wrapping cloth..."

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.700
No, that's not the punch line.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.400
- Kaneshita-san is...
- Unexpected, right?

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.960
I was also surprised to see it the other day.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.710
How terrible. "Here's the wrapping cloth."

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.390
You don't need to be so uptight here, Niijima-san.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.300
No need to work so hard outside the office.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.620
If there's anything on your mind, speak up like you did the other day!

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.580
Of course, feel free to leave whenever you're tired of us.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.400
I'm first to admit I'm an annoying drunk.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.400
Will do.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:28.950

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.950
Kakeru, I want to stick with my job

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:41.450
as much as you want to do your best in London.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.200
I don't want to quit.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.320
I've had enough of him.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.220
Say, where's Yogo-kun?

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.140
He's running a bit late; he had some last-minute things to do.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.130
Yogo? Long time no see.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.380
Long time no see. What brings you here?

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.110
Actually, I was chosen to represent my squad on our site's recruitment page.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.700
I'm apparently being interviewed for it.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.400
I see.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.850
I can't be late. See you around.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.840
Yes.

- I mean...

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.200
Manju aren't scary, right?

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.000
- See? What a cutie.
- No, those are just sesame balls.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.210
Don't you get the skit? You were falling over with laughter.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.140
- What are you saying?
- Right, Niijima-san?

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.050
Honestly, I didn't really understand, either.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.910
Why are manju so scary? Are you allergic?

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.340
- "Allergic"?
- Yes, allergic.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.210
That's not true. Kasuhara-san, tell me you understand.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:56.400
- What?
- Anyone want to share an extra spicy mapo tofu?

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.900
- Me.
- I've had enough of you people.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.470
You people are the scary ones!

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.600
- Scary, how?
- Excuse me.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.290
One extra spicy mapo tofu, please.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.400
Hey, get off! Off!

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.190
What did you say?

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.600
[Preview]

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.900
- But I promised to save...
- That's why you should never say that!

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.800
Yogo-kun is serious but has no confidence.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.700
He's not confident he can save people.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.420
Because you have to!

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.540
"Promise" is a strong word.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.800
I was sent to Kobe to aid with relief.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.170
Even if neither the caller

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.700
nor we give up,
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.090
there will always be lives we can't save.
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.420
He'll be okay! I promise I'll save him!

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.990
You tend to get heated with uncooperative callers, right?

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.000
He stands behind you and listens in,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.360
then asks what you gleaned from that call.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.100
You got this! Dad, pull through!

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.100
My arms... Dad, I'm so sorry...
