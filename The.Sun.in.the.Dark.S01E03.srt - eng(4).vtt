Let's see how much longer
you can hold on.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.280
You know what?

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.200
Sometimes mental torture

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.200
is more terrifying than physical pain.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.039
Well?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.080
Can't remember it?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.719
Need me to jog your memory?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.800
Monster!

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.800
Go out!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.919
Monster!

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.919
Go out!

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.000
Monster!

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.960
Go out!

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.039
Monster!

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.000
Go out!

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.039
Monster!

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.000
Go out!

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.000
She's a monster! Get out!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.280
Monster! Go out!

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.159
Monster! Go out!

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.919
- Get out!
- Leave Su City!

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.719
- Leave Su City!
- She's from the Night Clan!

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.319
Mother.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.159
She'll get us killed!

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.520
Mother!

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Leave Su City!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.319
You're not welcome here!

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.560
Mother.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.319
Mother.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.400
Stay away from us!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.080
Get out!

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.919
Out!

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.759
Mother.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.840
Mother.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.879
I'm here.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.560
Rest assured.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.120
I miss you so much.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.199
Mother.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.919
I'm here.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.039
I'm here.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.120
Get out!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.400
Stop it!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.080
Get out!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Stop it!

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000
Get out! Monster!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.240
Stop it!

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.120
Stop it!

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.340
Your enemy is right here.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.360
Yet you can't even avenge your mother!

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
Loser.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.960
Please.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.039
Stop! Stop it!

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.080
Monster! Get out!

00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.216
- But I don't want to stop.
- Monster! Get out!

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.199
It's such an interesting scene.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.759
Stay longer.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.919
Please.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.319
Please stop it!

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.879
I'm begging you!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.800
This is your punishment.

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:20.879
- Get out!
- How could I possibly end it now?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.160
Mother.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.879
What have I done wrong

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.639
to face such torment?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.680
Mother.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.079
I can't hold on much longer.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.319
You told me to live well,

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.519
yet I can't personally kill my enemy,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.040
nor forget all this torment.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.199
What should I do?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.879
Mother!

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.079
No!

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.160
No!

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.120
No!

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.800
Stop crying.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.879
I don't want you to stain my dream.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.100
(Mother!)

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.560
(What's going on?)

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:59.779
(Could it be...?)

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.839
(No.)

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.819
(He'd never do that for me.)

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.980
(I must be counterattacked
by the Dream Spell,)

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.600
(so I had such an absurd dream.)

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:21.632
(This...)

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.680
(Petal?)

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.560
(Was it really him?)

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.199
Why making that foolish face?

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.360
The second trial begins soon.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.240
Sleep now.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.240
Leave me alone.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.639
(He's just a creep.)

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.040
(How can it be him?)

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.399
(So annoying!)

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.560
The second trial

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.639
is to test your skills and courage.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.360
You are going to tame spirit beasts

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.439
in Youlan Forest.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.439
Whoever tames
higher-ranked spirit beasts wins.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.879
Remember.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.439
Youlan Forest is dangerous.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.160
Be careful of your safety.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.680
Don't try to be brave.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.519
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.720
Then, the trial begins.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.319
Stay alert.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.680
This place is terrifying.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.079
I can't see anything.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.759
Maybe we should go back.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.959
This place is full of dangerous beasts.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.959
Don't be that alert.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.560
Any spirit beast here

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.639
could kill you

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.519
easily.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.399
Monsters here?

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:08.920
Shut up!

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.920
- Why would she...?
- Stop it.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.240
She's in a foul mood today.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.139
Monsters!

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.360
Don't eat me! I don't taste well!

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:28.360
Come out!

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:28.819
Shut up.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.480
Look!

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.279
It's nothing special.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:53.799
Just a puppy!

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.159
What a scare.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.639
So cute.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.159
(He's scared of dogs.)

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:12.360
Scared of such a cute puppy?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.279
Get this eyesore away.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.240
It taints my sight.

00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:25.200
Don't listen to that demon.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.559
You're the cutest!

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.039
Go find your mother.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.120
Senior!

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.360
Senior!

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.440
The fog is too thick.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.759
We've been circling this area.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.879
You lack foundation,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.200
so you can't even notice

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.240
such an obvious maze.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.480
Sorry for making a detour

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.759
with me.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.480
Bai Xiaoying. We meet again.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.200
If you want to chat,

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.039
we can do it after the trial.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.679
I'll take my leave now.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.639
You think you can escape?

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.840
What do you mean?

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:48.399
I don't understand

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.159
why you always pester me.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.399
It depends

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.240
on you.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.399
If you quit now,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.320
I'll let bygones be bygones.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.759
I'm just a lowly cleaner.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.639
You don't need to take me seriously.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:09.480
You'll surely win this trial.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.679
If I find any high-ranked spirit beasts,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.440
I'll give them to you immediately.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.600
What a sweet talker!

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:19.440
I almost believed you.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.440
But you are the most threat to me.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:24.720
Anyway,

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:26.320
you can't remain here.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:27.159
Get her!

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.720
Miasma!

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:47.720
Shield your airways!

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:01.360
So fast.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.799
What is it?

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.559
Dispel the miasma and find out.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.080
The universe,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:08.919
yin and yang,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.039
all realms,

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:10.960
heed my command!

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.879
Dispel!

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.159
The miasma's gone.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:20.960
Senior.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.559
You dispelled my miasma?

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.879
It seems

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:37.360
you can't die in peace!

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.279
Or else my child

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.240
won't rest in peace.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.320
What happened?

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.480
I should ask you!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.919
Who killed my child?

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.980
Bai Xiaoying did it!

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.379
It's her.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.419
We stayed all together,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.659
yet she wandered alone!

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.299
Besides, we don't even know your child,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.779
yet she recognized him.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.860
This proves it.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.059
Yes, she's the killer!

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:09.019
We all saw it.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.580
I didn't do it!

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.620
It was you!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.259
You were alone.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.419
You were always alone.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.659
We stayed together.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.740
Who else could it be?

00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:17.620
- So cruel.
- Bai Xiaoying, you're so cruel!

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.419
Come help me.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.059
You're truly scared of dogs?

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:39.899
Night Deity, what a loser!

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:53.980
I didn't do it!

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:55.460
I didn't do it!

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.899
Enough.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:13:59.980
I want you to join my son in death!

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:06.740
Bai Xiaoying would be killed.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.460
Maybe we should inform the Lord.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.740
Her life or death
is none of our concern.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.940
What we need to do is

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:13.664
to wait until they are both wounded,

00:14:13.664 --> 00:14:14.816
and subdue the Monster Dog.

00:14:14.816 --> 00:14:15.936
- How dare you steal my son!
- This way,

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.620
we'll pass the trial.

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:19.059
Wanyan is right.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:20.139
Let's do so.

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:20.779
No!

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:22.179
I didn't do it.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.740
Your fellows saw it.

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:25.139
Stop denying!

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:43.220
It was Wanyan.

00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:45.179
It's Wanyan who killed him.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.580
I didn't do it!

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:47.779
Don't believe her lie!

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.659
She's the killer!

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.259
Yes.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.740
You did it, Bai Xiaoying.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:52.340
How could it be Wanyan?

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.620
Still denying now?

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.500
You killed my child.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.340
Just go die!

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:02.940
Bai Xiaoying.

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:04.860
Rest in peace here.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.059
I'll inform Master

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:08.659
that you died recklessly
by a spirit beast.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:14.620
Your daughter

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.860
is a monster!

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.299
She'll get us all killed!

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:18.820
Leave Su City!

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:19.980
You're not welcome.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.940
Get out!

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.580
Mother!

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:26.220
Mother!

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.539
Why?

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.139
Why?

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.659
I won't accept this.

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:34.779
I won't accept this.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.740
(You can't accept this.)

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.019
(Why?)

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.100
(Why can they live carefree?)

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.899
(Is this world)

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.179
(being fair to you?)

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:45.379
Who are you?

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.460
I am...

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.299
(This aura resembles
the strange power from Xiaoying.)

00:16:16.379 --> 00:16:17.379
(I have to figure it out)

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:18.779
(in Youlan Forest.)

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.100
My lord.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.500
Must be the spirit beasts.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.179
I'll go investigate.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:24.899
Hurry.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.279
Bai Xiaoying.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.519
Even if you survive,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.039
don't steal my spirit beast!

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:53.759
You insignificant dare to stop me?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.639
Bai Xiaoying.

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:55.600
You're insane!

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.159
You guys,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.080
get her!

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.600
We'll get the Immortal Lord.

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:02.919
Hang on.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.919
Losers!

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.380
In my eyes,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.140
you're a complete loser.

00:17:46.573 --> 00:17:47.413
♪In your gaze lie♪

00:17:47.413 --> 00:17:50.068
♪Earthly sparks
and starry charts to divine♪

00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:52.916
♪Can you add me into your story♪

00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:56.936
♪I paint my brows
and send mournful melodies♪

00:17:56.936 --> 00:17:59.508
♪Let the tale fade♪

00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:00.372
♪In your gaze lie♪

00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:03.220
♪The mundane world's glow
and the starry river's flow♪

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.983
♪Yet by your side, I don't reside♪

00:18:05.983 --> 00:18:08.500
♪Only fleeting beauty remains♪

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.562
♪No one left to share the pain♪

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:17.240
Xiaoying must be nearby.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.380
Xiaoying!

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:27.140
Xiaoying.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.740
Xiaoying.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.536
Luckily, you are exhausted.

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:02.420
It's my fault

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.660
for having you face this alone.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.059
But I must go now.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.220
Miss.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.259
My head hurts so much.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.420
What happened to me?

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.180
You were injured during the trial.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.019
The elders brought you back.

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:43.380
The trial?

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.299
Why can't I remember anything?

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.299
Who took first place?

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:54.420
It was... Bai Xiaoying.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.140
Impossible!

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.299
Why her again?

00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.180
I don't believe it!

00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:01.539
My lord.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:04.579
Step back.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.940
What's wrong with you?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.099
Look at you.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.660
Where's your manner?

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.859
Father.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.940
Can't let Bai Xiaoying win the game.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.779
Whoever passes the second trial

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:21.259
can compete with upper immortals.

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:23.339
Don't let her fight Yunya.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.099
If she actually wins,

00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:26.779
how can a mere cleaner

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:28.140
be the War God?

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.019
Absurd!

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:32.579
How could she possibly win?

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.619
Not to mention Yunya,

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.539
elders of the Nine Heavens

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.099
have centuries of cultivation.

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:39.539
You think they're that weak?

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.819
I understand, Father.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.619
But Bai Xiaoying's recent progress

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:45.059
is truly abnormal, Father.

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:45.859
I'm worried...

00:20:57.779 --> 00:20:58.140
My lord.

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.099
What's the matter?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.700
Anomalies suddenly occurred
in the Youlan Forest.

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:06.099
Bai Xiaoying of Yunxiu Pavilion

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.779
suddenly unleashed extraordinary power.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.460
As I know,

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.460
she has got an immortal root,

00:21:13.779 --> 00:21:15.700
but remains a novice.

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:17.259
Yet in Youlan Forest,

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:20.099
she outperformed even Wanyan.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.180
Don't you find this suspicious?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.019
I've investigated this matter.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.819
The Monster Dog went mad

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.140
and forced his power into Xiaoying.

00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:32.940
Thus, Xiaoying awakened her potential

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.819
and obtained a lot of cultivation.

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:42.900
That's possible.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.299
I understand.

00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:49.380
You may leave.

00:22:01.073 --> 00:22:03.296
(Huiyue Abode)

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.220
It's late now.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.539
Don't you go practicing?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900
Waiting to be killed?

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.420
Yesterday,

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:26.940
the demonic energy within me erupted

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.740
because of you, right?

00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:32.259
Being a demon felt good, right?

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.980
I will never forgive you

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:39.779
to kill my mother.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.980
Now you try to let me be a demon?

00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:44.859
I will only hate you more.

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:47.700
If not for the Night Deity's power,

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.579
you'd have been devoured by Monster Dog.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.579
Night Clan

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:55.619
only knows how to violently seize power

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:57.140
and harm others?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.259
So what's different about you?

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:03.140
Though I bear ill omens,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.619
I've never wanted to harm anyone.

00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:08.259
I live

00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:11.700
only to kill the Night Deity.

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:14.500
Now you want me to be a demon.

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.180
You might as well kill me!

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.779
What are you doing?

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.859
I just want you to know

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.660
being a demon isn't that agonizing.

00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:42.220
Xiaoying.

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:43.579
Master.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.740
It's okay.

00:23:46.859 --> 00:23:48.420
There's something I want to ask you.

00:23:49.059 --> 00:23:51.220
In Youlan Forest,
you were nearly out of control,

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:52.940
like demonic possession.

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:55.299
You worked so hard

00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:56.940
just to avenge your mother?

00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:02.539
When we first met,

00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:04.339
you told me to stay away.

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:07.380
Because you know
your power could harm others.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.900
Yet now,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.380
you use it for vengeance

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:12.140
and ignore the consequences?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.940
Sorry, Master.

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:20.579
I lost control.

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.059
It won't happen again.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.220
I won't cause you more trouble.

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:30.380
I'm glad then.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.460
I'm your master,

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:34.539
and you are my chosen disciple.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:36.299
No matter what,

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.140
I'll protect you.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:43.140
Thank you,

00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:44.619
Master.

00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:52.619
The Divine Sword Trial Assembly

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.420
now enters the Upper Immortal Trial.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.019
One matter worries me.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.180
Bai Xiaoying

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.460
of Yunxiu Pavilion erupts incredible

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.539
and suspicious power.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.299
I fear she may be a spy from Night Clan.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.740
So she must not win

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.832
to get the Divine Sword.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.859
We need to figure out a way
to uncover the truth.

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:21.019
This task falls to you.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.299
No need to tell Yunya.

00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:25.380
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:25:29.339 --> 00:25:31.740
After the intense trial
in the previous round,

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.259
four skilled immortal disciples
stood out.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.019
They are Upper Immortal Yunya...

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:48.779
Upper Immortal Yongning...

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.059
Junior Immortal Attendant Bai Xiaoying.

00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:58.220
- Xiaoying, well done!
- Amazing!

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.619
And Senior Immortal Attendant Wanyan.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.140
They will compete
for the Sword Master position.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.940
Wasn't she eliminated
during the Youlan Forest trial?

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.779
I heard it's Upper Immortal Xiyuan
who recommended her,

00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:18.819
claiming Wanyan lost due to injuries.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.420
So she came back as a substitute.

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:25.059
I heard the Immortal Lord
repeatedly rejected it

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.500
until all elders jointly petitioned
for her inclusion.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.019
So unfair!

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.980
Exactly!

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:33.920
First round,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.400
Immortal Yongning of Taixu Palace

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.359
versus Immortal Yunya
of Yunxiu Pavilion.

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:50.359
Yunya.

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.119
If you lose to me today,

00:26:52.192 --> 00:26:52.832
don't be bad.

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:53.960
I'll buy you drinks.

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.319
Or I'll buy you drinks instead.

00:26:57.319 --> 00:26:59.279
The trial begins.

00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:08.720
I can't follow any of these moves.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.539
Xiaoying,

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:12.220
do you think Master can win?

00:27:12.859 --> 00:27:13.339
Of course.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.779
Master is incredible.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.460
He won't lose to anyone.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.259
And he won't lose to those demons

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.220
who are self-righteous with bad temper.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.619
Who is it?

00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:27.660
No one.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.140
I lost.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.059
I lost.

00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:40.220
Buy me drinks tonight.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.259
Second combat,

00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.299
Bai Xiaoying of Yunxiu Pavilion

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.660
versus Wanyan.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.380
The trial begins.

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.220
In Youlan Forest,

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.740
you defeated me
with the Monster Dog's power.

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:08.140
Today,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.900
I'll reclaim my honor in public!

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:14.140
She's looking down on you.

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:16.299
Show her what you got.

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:19.059
In Youlan Forest,

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.859
I can get the Monster Dog's power

00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:22.140
thanks entirely to your help.

00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:23.259
You...

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:24.539
Enough talk.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.180
Let's fight then.

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:48.779
How can she defeat me?

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.700
Intensified Spirit Herb?

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.180
Doesn't look special.

00:29:01.259 --> 00:29:02.859
Don't underestimate it.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.539
It can multiply your cultivation

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:07.819
several times in moments.

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:09.579
Use it wisely.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.259
I'll use it tomorrow
to crush that wretched Bai Xiaoying.

00:29:15.579 --> 00:29:17.859
Wanyan, don't.

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:20.980
You'll be punished if caught.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.140
Elder.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.700
You're the judge.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.940
No one knows but you.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.940
Besides,

00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:30.220
would my father let me lose
to a low-ranked disciple?

00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:32.140
Well...

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:47.140
Bai Xiaoying.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.299
You're doomed.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.839
Impossible!

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.759
You filthy rat!

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.799
How dare you try to defeat me?

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.420
Impossible!

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:15.779
Elder Kongming!

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.299
Why did Wanyan's spiritual power surge?

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.660
Yunya.

00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:24.660
Wanyan's recent progress
has been remarkable.

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:26.740
There's nothing special.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.259
(This world is so unfair.)

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.420
(No matter how hard you try,)

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:39.460
(you will still be trampled over.)

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.140
A mortal came to cultivate?

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.299
Absurd!

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.339
Go back to sweep floors!

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.940
Disobeyed Senior Wanyan?

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.740
You motherless

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.420
lowly wretch!

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.900
(Will you accept this?)

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.660
(Accept your fate?)

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:53.859
Terrible!

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.660
