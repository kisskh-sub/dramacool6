The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.560
It was a much more comfortable death than I expected.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.740
Even I was tempted

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.140
Later Wait Later

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.680
You should also entrust Lawyer Park.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.640
Don't talk about later

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.030
I want to give you a proposal now.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.460
This time I can offer a bigger amount than Representative Chen

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.930
What is the proposal?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.710
represent

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.440
Represent that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.190
The remaining Bafron

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.630
Did you take that away?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.280
What did you say

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.990
Damn that...

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.190
That bastard quack seems to have taken away the Barflon.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.420
What

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.130
What are you doing?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.690
Damn

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.270
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.840
-=Episode 9=-

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.160
Yes, I understand.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.190
This side

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.460
What did you do again?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.490
Is it my fault that someone close to me died?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.060
Who is this time

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.460
Ye-na's brother Gun-soo dies

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.930
He was diagnosed with a terminal illness

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.690
Collapsed during the performance

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.530
Is this another coincidence?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.790
I'm afraid of being suspected like this.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.730
I called an ambulance.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.590
Even the behavior that makes me suspicious

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.990
It's my fault, right?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.030
Safety first Safety first

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.660
What is this?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.660
Choi Dae-hyun

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.990
You lied to me

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.760
It's like this because of messing around, isn't it?

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.490
How do you say you want to deal with it?

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.630
Let's stop here

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.430
Just here

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.660
It looks natural, like an accident.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.660
If you do anything else, it will be exposed.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.090
You just keep staying like this

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.290
Yu Suzhen and I will take action later

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.290
Looks good.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.630
Wow, I'm here. I'm really excited.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.860
Are you applying to date me?

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.790
You were the one who caused Daxian's accident, right?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.290
Calm down

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.530
Why did you hit someone?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.330
Why did you do that?

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.560
Daxian almost died because of you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.790
Hello, Yu Suzhen

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.880
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.430
Kill me if you want

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.660
Daxian just did what I said, that's all.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.630
Do you think you are so great?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.990
Why are you so confident?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.630
Think carefully

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.730
I was the first victim

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.860
You stole my things.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.030
So if you want to kill me, kill me

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.630
It all started with me

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.760
I can't do anything to our Yu Suzhen.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.660
How could I bear to kill you?

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.460
You are so skilled with Bafulong.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.060
Hello, there is

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.960
Why do you care so much about those people?

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.430
Your useless friend Choi Dae-hyun

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.630
And that useless little nurse

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.020
Get rid of them

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.430
Just cooperate with me cleanly

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.790
I will take good care of you

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.070
I don't want to work with someone like you.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.430
besides

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.020
If you dare to touch the people around me again

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.160
I'll take you to the police station immediately.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.530
Oh, so cute

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.860
If you appear in front of me again

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.190
You and I will perish together.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.890
Are you acting cute? Oh, that's scary.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.620
Because something happened to Jianzhu suddenly

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.360
I couldn't clean up after the performance

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.760
Now processing

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.060
Why did Yu Suzhen and Choi Daxian come?

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.940
The doctor who came to the show

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.820
It seems that Ye Na invited her.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.930
She has been helping check the status in the lounge

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.430
Take care of him

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.830
Thanks to her, Gun-soo was able to persevere in the performance to this extent.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.160
No house

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.160
It's a really remote place

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.610
They must have found this kind of place on purpose.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.360
We need to ensure surveillance video

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.760
Please cooperate.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.710
OK, I understand.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.690
What? Everyone gathered together.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.960
Didn't Choi Gun-soo die of natural causes?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.760
Even wedding banquets are not this lively.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.160
I heard that before going to Switzerland for euthanasia

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.130
Some people also have parties with friends

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.980
Maybe that's the case.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.190
But if Choi Gun-soo was euthanized

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.480
Where did Yu Suzhen get the Baflon?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.760
Isn't Jin Shijian dead?

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.430
She must have prepared a lot of Bafron before that.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.470
impossible

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.160
Every time something happens

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.030
We searched around Yu Suzhen

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.390
No Bafron found.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.960
Under our surveillance

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.440
She couldn't possibly store it.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.460
Before each action

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.530
She must have redone it.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.190
If that's the case

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.430
Have you found a new supply channel for Bafron?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.430
Go and confirm the location of those two people.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.590
See where they went before the show

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.890
yes

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.390
I was quite excited before I died.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.160
Very sad

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.120
I want to kill someone

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.920
But this isn't murder.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.980
You also said

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.810
For those who suffer too much, death may be a better option.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.160
Okay, then we

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.810
Do it well

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.530
What is this

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.360
I guess she's an insider.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.190
If I ask for leave to go on a family trip to Gangwon Province

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.430
You have to take something with you.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.790
I'm so embarrassed. Hurry up.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.930
Really

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.490
I suddenly felt like someone was following me.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.590
Who is following you?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.430
Is it representative?

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.160
No, no, I made a mistake.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.730
I'll do it.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.680
Should be able to work

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.130
Yu Suzhen

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.010
sorry

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.260
That's obviously where you can get the medicine.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.910
I made things difficult for you.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.210
Need to get medicine

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.420
But because of us, the investigation became too strict

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.380
Couldn't find anyone else who could get Barfron.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.690
If you can't get the medicine, then just say you can't get it.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.660
There's no other way.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.860
Ye-na and Gun-soo are waiting

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.990
I didn't know you were going to do something so dangerous.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.040
Just do what you want to do comfortably

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.110
I'm really sorry for making you suffer like this.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.960
It's really touching.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.340
Even though it was something we all agreed on, I don't regret it.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.960
But I think it's time to stop.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.110
Too dangerous

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.720
I know

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.460
It's very dangerous at the moment. We have to be careful.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.910
No, not temporarily

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.660
I think we should stop completely, Suzhen.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.990
This time it's me

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.990
Next time it might be you or Ye-na

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.220
Don't think about anything else now

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.290
Focus on taking good care of your body first

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.130
I understand what you mean

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.330
We've gone too far

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.460
It's time to stop

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.640
Let's stop here

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.190
Now I

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.640
What I can do for you

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.160
Just wish you good night

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.590
Have a sweet dream

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.190
goodbye

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.970
Good night

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.790
Have a sweet dream

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.390
goodbye

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.640
What are you doing here?

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.760
Why don't you contact me when you come?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.570
Aren't you very busy?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.030
I'm waiting for you

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.820
oops

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.110
My brother looks good.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.420
Looks like you've been doing well recently.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.190
Doesn't it hurt now?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.860
My brother doesn't feel any pain at all.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.540
My brother

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.160
Thanks to you, I'm doing really well.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.190
I can still see my mother

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.080
I am really happy

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.990
Really

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.790
You are happier now than when you were with me. I am a little sad.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.690
Oh, why are you sad, girl?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.890
Mom is doing well too, don't worry.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.810
Ye Na

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.390
Are you happy?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.990
Of course

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.580
I miss my mom too.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.790
When the time comes, we will meet naturally.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.370
Wait, it's still a long time.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.980
Um

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.780
That's right

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.970
I prepared a new song.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.200
You have to listen to it.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:34.940
good

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.630
You know my guitar skills, right?

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.350
It's really bad

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.050
right

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.090
Play it for me

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.060
Okay

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.980
Even if you count countless stars one by one

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:58.160
I can no longer fathom your heart

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:07.120
Because your heart is broken into pieces

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.750
The coldness dissipates in the air

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:22.470
The one you loved so deeply in the past

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.850
What are my looks?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:37.320
What I can do for you now

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:45.010
Only greetings of good night, sweet dreams and goodbye

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.310
Only goodnight

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.260
Sweet Dreams

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.590
Goodbye greetings

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.860
Dr. Yu

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.970
Leave the job of taking care of Dr. Dae-hyun to me.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.880
I rushed here with my luggage as soon as I received the news

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.760
Thanks

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.140
I heard it was a hit-and-run.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.670
The cause of the accident is still unknown?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.730
I don't think the car accident was an accident

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:41.760
So what you mean is

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.210
Did someone deliberately bump into Dr. Cui?

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.210
What problems might have occurred during the purchase of medicine?

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.910
To buy medicine for my brother

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.480
Did you do something dangerous?

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.850
You stay here with Daxian for the time being.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.110
This will be safer

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.080
I'll ask around for a place to stay later.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.110
Don't worry, Dr. Cui.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.450
I will take good care of him

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.780
Thanks

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.520
Emergency patient, please give way.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.250
What's going on?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.400
She seems to have taken sleeping pills

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.890
I thought I threw it all away

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.680
Did she take it regularly?

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.610
Yes, because of drug resistance

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.600
So she seems to have eaten a lot.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.010
don’t worry

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.260
The patient seems to have regained consciousness

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.490
OK, thanks

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.320
I need to do a few more tests.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.590
You don't have to worry about her anymore

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.350
If you feel uncomfortable, you can sit outside and wait.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.320
OK

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.070
Let's do a basic blood test first.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.280
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.340
The day Choi Gun-soo died

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.370
Choi Dae-hyun visited a building in Gangnam

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.350
But there's nothing suspicious in that building.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.350
The most suspicious person is the landlord

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.900
Does the host have a drug record?

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.050
No, originally everyone in that building

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.120
It is this entrepreneur named Chen Yingxiu

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.990
But I just changed everyone a few days ago.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.880
Because of debt, the entire building was used to pay off the debt.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.030
Do you know anything about the operation of Guguang Assets?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.110
Yes, they replied that they couldn't confirm.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.420
And the former owner Chen Yingxiu is also dead

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.780
Can't confirm now

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.760
I heard he was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.950
He and Choi Gun-soo died on the same day

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.410
Wait a moment

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.070
That is, terminally ill patients

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.780
He died on the day Choi Dae-hyun went there.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.750
Choi Dae-hyun didn't go to this building to buy medicine

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.450
Probably due to euthanasia.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.400
That's right

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.310
I received the news that Choi Dae-hyun was in a car accident and hospitalized.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.240
What

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.730
If my wife is okay now

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.240
Please help me

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.320
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.170
Please let me die

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.640
I don't understand what you are saying

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.080
Actually, he is my client.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.300
You told me to be careful recently, but I didn't tell you

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.440
Park Tae-hyung has been diagnosed with a terminal illness due to malignant mesothelioma

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.520
Malignant mesothelioma: A tumor that develops in the mesothelial layer of the pleura, the lining of the chest, the peritoneum, or the pericardium that covers the heart.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.990
You seem to be having trouble breathing

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.100
It turns out it was because of this disease

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.930
Malignant mesothelioma

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.990
This is the beginning

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.980
This disease alone is making me miserable.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.310
At first I just thought there was a thief in the house

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.530
Late at night, a strange man

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.510
Standing in the hallway of our house

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.610
I was very shocked and scared

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.780
Just collapsed on the spot

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.190
Did I see a ghost?

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.700
Or am I crazy?

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.610
Later I learned that I had dementia

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.770
The name of the disease is also unfamiliar

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.750
Lewy body dementia

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.100
Lewy body dementia is different from Alzheimer's disease

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.900
Although the initial memory is not damaged

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.700
But vivid visual hallucinations and hallucinations can cause distress to patients.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.080
Yes, that's right.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:00.230
The feeling of seeing strangers at home every day

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.830
Makes me feel scared like a child

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.190
It seems that hallucinations scare you more than pain.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.580
Doctor, I heard that for patients who cannot be cured

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.850
Some different treatments will be given

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.070
Please

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.830
Let me out of this pain

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.760
Get rid of it

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.600
Hello

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.060
Hello

00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.770
Dr. Cui, are you okay?

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.670
Someone has been here all the time and just left.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.230
Calm down first.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.800
I walked down this corridor

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.470
I didn't see anyone running away from here.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.860
No, no, I'm leaving here.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.970
Dr. Cui, you can't move now.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.290
You still need to continue treatment

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.620
Transfer me to Father Yang's hospital, okay?

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.010
I don't want to stay here anymore

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.580
The inspection has been completed

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.490
You can be discharged tomorrow morning.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.590
Is your husband out?

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.460
He is in poor health

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.260
My nephew brought him home.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.290
So you're staying here by yourself today?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.750
I know what you're worried about.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.580
But as long as my husband is alive

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.500
I won't seek death

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.270
Because I know how much it would hurt him.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.570
I'll recommend another doctor for you.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.460
Once you find the right doctor, things will get better.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.520
I've seen almost every psychiatrist for my husband.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.070
Life is really unpredictable

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.180
I have such a good husband.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.340
But I can't be happy

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.690
So don't worry

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.730
As long as my husband is alive

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.680
I won't die

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.510
Are you waiting?

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.010
After your husband dies

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.090
Will you be free to make your choice then?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.840
For terminally ill patients whose pain cannot be relieved

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.010
You can let them rest in eternal peace

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.980
My pain has never been alleviated by any method in my life

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.750
So can I also

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.450
I want to go with my husband.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.990
After he leaves

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.270
I don't want to live anymore

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.600
I won't let healthy people die.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.920
Am I healthy?

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.910
My heart is sick like this

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.410
Am I still a healthy person?

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.000
For patients like me

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.080
Have you ever considered

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.620
You said you live for your husband, right?

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.990
You don't want your husband to get hurt.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.480
Then please hold on a little longer.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.990
He's suffering enough now.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.550
And there are not many days left

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.830
We cannot bring the sadness of losing a family member to such a person again.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.130
I know this request is selfish and cruel.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.280
terribly sorry

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.350
sorry

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.950
I shouldn't say these things.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.250
Please don't take what I say to heart.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.970
Please help my husband.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.550
That person

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.000
The right to die with dignity

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.300
Please

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.470
How many times do I have to say it?

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.220
Ye Na's brother has been diagnosed with a terminal illness

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.620
We're just assisting him.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.200
Make sure he finishes the show

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.550
You all helped so much.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.200
Why did he die?

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.750
He obviously died of illness.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.420
Do we still have to explain this to you?

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.970
Ye-na just lost her brother a few days ago

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.550
Then I'll change the question

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.800
Choi Gun-soo's performance

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.370
Why did you go to Gangnam?

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.850
I'm going to meet a friend.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:20.870
Which friend

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.450
Could you please let us confirm?

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.300
He is from a foreign country.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.850
He should have left the country by now.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.450
What are you doubting?

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.550
We think Choi Dae-hyun, you go to Gangnam

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.100
To get the Bafron

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.800
Am I crazy?

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.600
I've been watched by you all.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.070
Would you still do such a thing?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.970
Someone died in that building.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.070
Do you know Chen Yingxiu?

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.470
Unknown

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.520
Such a high-intensity investigation of patients

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.620
Is that a bit too much?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.920
Dr. Daxian was involved in a hit-and-run accident

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.650
Please help chase the criminals first.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.300
No, we said

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.320
Are you still under suspicion of the police?

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.220
Why are they still acting together?

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.820
Let us be more suspicious

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320
We all work at Father Yang's hospital.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.700
Naturally

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.320
It's natural...

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.720
Naturally what

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.950
Started dating

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.020
What

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.000
oh...

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.550
Choi Dae-hyun

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.970
Talk to me alone.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.800
It's all because you lied to me

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.070
Doing these stupid things led to this.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.720
Yu Suzhen and I will act together from now on

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.570
Why did the police come to see our Dr. Cui?

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.670
Did you really commit a crime?

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.550
sorry

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.700
Is this matter

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.050
Is it related to Dr. Yu Suzhen?

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.370
I'll ask you again

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.900
Dr. Cui, what are you doing?

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.000
Is it the same thing as what Dr. Yu does?

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.050
I thought you were a very honest person, Dr. Cui.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.000
You disappointed me

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.850
Last time, the case was closed because of luck.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.620
But that doesn't mean what you're doing is right.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.750
You know that too.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.570
Father, you are right.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.070
I no longer think

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.120
This matter

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.670
It’s the right choice

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.500
This is where patients with nowhere else to go are housed.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.970
It's not used to hide criminals.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.020
God

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.550
Will forgive

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.370
Our sins, Father?

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.800
I should be forgiven.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.900
As long as you truly repent

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.300
So I hope Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.300
Can stop Dr. Yu

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.300
Captain An said he was a friend of Councillor Bai

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.700
We are not allowed to enter the building operated by Guguang Asset

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.100
Isn't it Councillor Bai who is urging us?

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.150
Can we get some results from our search?

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.620
That is to say

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.970
It's really strange

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.670
Chen Yingxiu, Guguang Asset Operations

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.450
He gets angry when these things are mentioned.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.870
Even if he is a friend of Councillor Bai

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.450
He is also a person related to the incident

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.750
No matter how you think about it, friends are just an excuse

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.950
Next time if you find important evidence

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.420
Don't go through Captain An

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.370
Report it directly to the MP.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:45.920
good

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.020
But how to search for the operation of Guguang Assets?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.600
The search here

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.720
I'll go by myself

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.600
What

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.420
If Captain An finds out later

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.670
Just say it's my personal behavior.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120
Forget it, kid.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.470
I'll take this responsibility.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.820
Have a cup of tea

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.250
I heard you're particularly curious about this office?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.420
This is my private space

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.970
You are not allowed to watch it at will

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.220
But if you scan it, you will find

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.720
This is a very ordinary place

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.850
I have a few questions for you

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.020
When the former building owner Chen Yingxiu died

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.870
Where are you

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.300
When was that

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.320
November 23

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.470
This day

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.320
I met a model at a party not long ago.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.950
Went for a drive and chatted

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.750
And kissed a few times

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.250
OK

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.500
Have you heard of Choi Dae-hyun?

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.700
I don't know

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.800
When did you move here?

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.620
Not long yet

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.450
Representing your home...

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.450
I told you, will you understand?

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.900
You know where you lived before?

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.970
Is Jin Shijian living there?

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.700
who is he

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.650
Do you know Councilman Baek Dong-hoon?

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.700
I'm not an employee of a credit bureau.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.350
Why did you come to me to ask about this person and that person?

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.520
It's Councilman Baek Dong-hoon

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.470
He and I were in the same church, so we knew each other.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.770
Last question

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.250
Where is An Taicheng?

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.800
Is An Taicheng successful?

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.600
-I don't know him. -Captain An

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.470
Don't you know him?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.720
oh

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.850
Captain An

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.920
Councillor Bai said that one should get to know more people when doing business

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.350
He introduced him to me

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.320
So I met him.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.000
Is there anything else you're curious about?

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.700
You should be busy

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.900
Please keep working.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.150
If you have any questions, please contact me

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.800
Did I say no?

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.620
Do you want to drop this case?

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.870
sorry

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.620
Did you tell them to ignore my instructions?

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.420
No

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.070
Zhixun's desire is too much

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.170
Not Detective Pan.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.250
We are not together

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.050
Detective Pan acted alone...

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.950
That's not the case either.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.350
sorry

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.750
When Pan Zhixun comes back, let him come to my room

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.000
The police also came here yesterday

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.720
Although this may cause doubt

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.600
But they can't arrest you.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.320
I did it wrong at the beginning

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.120
I shouldn't have started this.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.250
No matter what good reasons you come up with

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.800
This is killing people

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.120
Seeing those patients who are suffering

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.970
Don't you agree with my idea?

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.550
Yeah, that's just a high-sounding excuse.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.500
I just want to be like those illegal practitioners

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.920
Easy money, easy work

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.000
That's why I agreed to your request.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.450
If I had known that I would be chased by the police like this

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.800
Become a criminal suspect

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.900
I won't do it

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.820
So what should I do?

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.050
If you want to continue doing this

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.550
Not only will you hurt yourself

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.150
It will also kill me and Ye-na.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.770
So you promised me

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.620
Won't touch this again

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.870
For you, I can be more cautious.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.250
But I can't promise you

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.020
If you give up so easily

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.770
I wouldn't have chosen to start in the first place.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.200
Is your belief more important than me and Ye-na?

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.050
That's not what I meant.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.450
If you want to continue

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.770
Don't come to me again

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:16.020
-Are you serious? -Yes

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.470
I am very serious

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.870
Being involved with you, living in fear

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.400
I don't want to live like this anymore

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.070
So if you insist on continuing

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:30.950
Let's not meet again.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.820
Please deal with it quickly.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.220
If my uncle dies, I will inherit the estate.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.950
I heard this three years ago.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.400
But compared to this

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.400
The police are watching.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.220
Why are you so anxious to send your uncle away?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.320
Is this correct?

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.550
I feel too anxious.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.500
I don't have that much patience.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.700
So I have something to tell you.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.050
Park Tae-hyung's nephew contacted me

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.420
Park Tae-hyung is in really bad condition right now

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.050
I want to meet Dr. Yu in person.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.670
Although I want to help, I still have some concerns.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.020
Do you have any concerns?

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.800
As long as you can promise

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.650
Any help I can offer

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.350
For those who are not mentally prepared

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.950
I can't do that treatment.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.100
For whatever reason

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.650
As long as you still have a fondness for life

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.900
This treatment will only kill people.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.920
Park Tae-hyung is very worried about his death

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.800
Will become a lonely wife

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.100
I won't let my uncle worry and I will take good care of my aunt.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.780
So you just believe me

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.090
Please help my uncle, he is in real pain.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.110
Please

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.680
Park Tae-hyung's euthanasia

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.350
It's very suitable for Yu Suzhen to do it

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.360
But our previous method was difficult to convince Yu Suzhen.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.330
So this time we're going to use a more common approach.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.210
Implement the battle plan against Yu Suzhen

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.720
This is right

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.040
So I have to deceive her like a normal client.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.030
No, Yu Suzhen is being chased by the police now.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.290
Would you be willing to help my uncle?

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.440
You say this because you don't know her. You don't have to worry.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.710
Yu Suzhen is a very soft-hearted doctor towards patients

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.620
And Park Tae-hyung's disease name is real.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.390
His story is also very pitiful.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:10.020
So Yu Suzhen will never refuse

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.450
I'll help you. Just trust me.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.630
Not only is my uncle, I won't let you worry

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.500
Will prepare everything

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.370
Who told you to make trouble everywhere?

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.700
Whose instructions were you given?

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.200
Do you also know CEO Koo Kwang-chul?

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:41.470
What

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.690
Representative Gu Guangzhe said he greeted you.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.980
I thought you guys were familiar with each other

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.000
Didn't you just say hello?

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.190
Just a greeting. What? Is it important?

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.770
As far as I know

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.610
There are many people in the financial sector

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.830
All the money was handed over to Representative Gu Guangzhe

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.870
He often parties with people who entrust him with their money

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.320
But the suspicious thing is

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.590
Most of the participants have drug convictions or are suspected of drug use.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.350
Are you talking about some kind of hallucination party?

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.190
Just your guess

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.700
Are you just going to mess things up based on speculation?

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.960
If you agree, I will conduct a formal investigation.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.270
Next time, I will report and then take action.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.360
Don't make people look ridiculous.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.280
knew

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.590
Thanks

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.510
You must be tired too

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.790
Because I worked hard. I'm sorry.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.930
You're welcome

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.870
You also helped my brother.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.350
Are we a team?

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.380
Of course we have to do it together.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.200
Thanks

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.590
That Dr. Cui

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.380
The bag you gave me last time

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.470
It was taken away by Dr. Yu

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.610
Oops, Dr. Cui, sorry to disturb your rest.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.430
But now a lot of medical supplies have arrived at the hospital

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.630
and the meat and rice eaten by the patient

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.720
A lot of donated items came

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.740
Really? It's a good thing.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.600
Which group sent it?

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.360
It's not a group, it's an individual donation.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.230
But the donor said

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.510
Tell him what medical facilities the hospital needs now

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.250
He will buy it immediately

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.450
So I want to ask you

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:04.540
So that's it

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.300
Is that a member of the church here?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.970
right

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.740
Representative Gu Kwang-chul

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.500
My family members are all members of our church.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.130
But this is the first time I donated to a hospital

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.400
Said it was recommended by an acquaintance

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.370
Wait, is his name Gu Kwang-chul?

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.690
Representative Gu Guangzhe

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.770
-I am from the seventh term. -Senior

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.630
I am a younger generation than you.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.820
Wow, what a coincidence!

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.190
Wow, thank you.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.340
Wow, what a coincidence!

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.590
I'm so lucky! Put that one over there!

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.910

Don't insist anymore

Because you can't sort out the situation.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.310
how

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.800
Do you want to be beaten again?

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.300
Do you still want to be beaten before eating, you arrogant ghost?

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.290
Open your mouth! Open your mouth!

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.560
Let you enjoy everything without missing anything

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.980
Why do you want to die?

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.440
Not knowing how to appreciate the blessings you have

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.380
So you're a psychopath.

Wife

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.560
Is this true?

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.840
No way

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.490
It's fine

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.180
I'm fine

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.670
today

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.250
Just go

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.250
Leave quietly...

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.690
There will be no change

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.830
Follow your promise

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.820
I will comply

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.220
The suicide note will not change

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:54.400
You just need to connect me with that doctor.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.310
There will be no change

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.330
so

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.200
Please

You have to meet Dr. Yu with me.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.600
I have something to convince her of.

There is indeed a functional relationship

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.460
I feel better after donating.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.590
What brought you here?

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.340
The tall detective came to see me

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.730
You said that, right?

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.060
Why didn't you say it?

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.370
He's very good to you.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.680
Anyway, I think it doesn't matter

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.970
Do you want to call the police?

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.480
Stop fighting

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.000
Without me

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.300
I don't know what he will do to you.

Let's leave together

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.190
My husband's condition has become very bad.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.370
The hallucinations are severe now.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.580
Keep your eyes closed all day

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.290
Can't see my face

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.970
All I see is fear

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.800
I told you too

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.350
My husband is really a great man.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.230
He has the right to die with dignity.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.920
If my husband died peacefully because of me

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.870
That for me

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.520
It is also the pain and pain that cannot be washed away

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.950
I understand your position.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.380
But I can't decide now

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.990
The most realistic problem is

00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:59.980
I don't have any medicine

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.640
Perhaps you are talking about Bafron?

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.280
I will find it

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.370
Actually, I

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.990
Previously defended dark web criminals

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.740
At that time, I didn't learn to buy medicine on purpose.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.000
Even though I know it's illegal

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.090
But for my uncle, there's nothing I can do.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.890
I will definitely buy it on that day

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.330
Help us

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.890
Help us

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:28.460
The tutor is coming. Are you ready?

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.180
The teacher said you are the child holding the door handle

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.890
You said you wanted to go out whenever you had the chance.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.310
You really embarrass me.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.240
Aren't you losing weight?

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.880
I practiced very hard and lost weight

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.450
Really

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.850
Is it to be longer?

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.240
If you dance ballet, it's best not to grow any longer.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.230
Hello

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.430
no

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.620
When I received your call

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.430
I thought you were drinking

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.300
After coming here, I really had to change my mind.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:34.100
I can

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.230
Wearing a bug

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:38.970
I will do as you tell me.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.660
Just let me see the police.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.800
No matter what you do, you can't protect Yu Suzhen

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.680
The guy who gave me the medicine

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.530
Now he's crazy and wants to kill me

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.100
Although I am ashamed

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.740
But I don't have the energy to protect Suzhen

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.310
I heard you took the bag back.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.470
Even if you object, there is no way

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.430
Park Tae-hyung in this state

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.470
More than anyone we've helped so far.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.440
People who need our treatment more

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.170
I didn't ask you to meet me just to object.

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.230
I know it's useless for me to object

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.520
So since it's like this

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:26.230
I'll go too.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.880
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.290
This isn't just your problem.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.720
As long as you don't stop

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.240
We would be dangerous indeed.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.060
If you're worried about that, that's okay.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.860
You don't have to come. I can do it myself.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.530
Well, not you

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.820
Because I'm uneasy

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:50.830
I'll go too.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:52.770
Let's go together

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.550
Choi Dae-hyun said he would assist in the investigation

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.990
They will be wearing bugs and cameras.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.310
Oh, why don't you clean it up?

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:11.850
Please take a seat

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.250
Choi Dae-hyun said

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.810
Will comply with all police requests

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.450
Now it's Officer Fu's turn to talk to me.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.190
Yu Suzhen, the main culprit

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.590
Choi Dae-hyun's accomplice

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.210
Don't charge them with drug trafficking.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:27.440
Yes, that's how it should be

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.800
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.560
It seems that he was threatened by the drug supplier.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.770
It's exhausting both mentally and financially.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.190
If you are threatened like this

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.020
Maybe I just want to accept the punishment and end it all.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:43.770
Take this opportunity to kill the threatening criminal

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:45.230
Just catch them together.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.290
But the target is not the threat criminal.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.670
I don't know who it is.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.310
It takes a long time to catch it.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.390
As long as I help you catch Yu Suzhen

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.680
Isn't that enough?

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.290
We want to end it as soon as possible

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.930
Yes, that is

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.690
Then let's capture Yu Suzhen first.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.430
The rest of us slowly

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.810
Catch him

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.590
-well

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.050
today

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:19.620
Doctor Yu will come

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.330
good

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.170
Words from the caregiver and aunt

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.540
I gave them this week off.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:30.310
good

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.060
Thank you

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.220
Aunt's words

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.940
Don't worry about her

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:47.740
uncle

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:49.590
During this period

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.000
Thanks a lot

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.560
Also wearing stab-proof clothing

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.030
Why? Are you afraid that Yu Suzhen will know you

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.230
After betraying her

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.810
Will he swing a knife at you?

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:56.530
Suzhen is scary when she's angry, even scarier than an excited patient.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.110
Don't worry too much

00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:59.780
ah

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:02.990
And you must abide by the agreement

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.880
Sentencing?

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:05.660
Don't worry about sentencing

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.050
If you break your promise

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:08.920
Your lawyer will kill me.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:10.600
Get ready quickly

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.410
No matter what happens

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.810
I will definitely abide by the agreement

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:07.630
Are you mentally prepared?

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:10.120
Yes

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.370
Thanks

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:06.710
You are here

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.000
Waiting for you

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:39.830
Let me do it

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.630
Just stand next to me.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.230
Have you got the medicine?

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:47.300
Uh-huh

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:48.870
Someone will bring it over. It should be here soon.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.810
Why not answer

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:22.950
What's the phone number?

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.990
Ah, nothing.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.250
Hello

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.360
What happened?

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:35.450
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.290
Didn't you say you would help us?

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:38.350
You actually tricked us

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:41.130
Doctor, we'll see each other again.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.530
husband

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.220
Why did you stop?

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.130
Please hurry up

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.190
-You are Caiyan, right? -Don't touch the child

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:51.210
You'd better go over there right now

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.560
The situation is getting dangerous and out of control.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.030
That drug dealer must be arrested.

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:59.200
A client appeared who wanted to pay more money.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.230
If you mess around again, you're really dead this time.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.210
Yu Suzhen is not immune
