=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 11=

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.970
It's all because of that Luo fellow.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.890
Now we can't even afford a meal.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.790
Exactly.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.200
Everyone, head on back.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.330
The Governor's troops will see you home.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.990
Much obliged, milord.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.410
Thank you, Marquis.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.830
Come on, let's go.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.330
At last, we can go home.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.470
Mishenfu has ruined countless lives.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.590
How dare you escort such a deadly thing!

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.680
Who ordered you to do this?

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.790
And what was your intent?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.270
I...

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.680
I dare not speak.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.890
Was it Mistress who's behind this?

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.870
Milord, no one guided me.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.950
No one guided you?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.510
Then you must be the mastermind.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.120
No, no, no, absolutely not.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.810
So this was all your doing.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.670
No, no, not me.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.670
- Then it's you.
- No... it's not me, milord.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.360
No, no, it's not me.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.460
It's not.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.240
Where did this Mishenfu come from?

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.520
Where is Mistress now?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.050
I dare not say.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.220
Besides "I dare not say",

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.170
what else can you say?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.310
Milord, Mistress sees through all things.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.090
If I speak too much today,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.520
I'll bring utter ruin upon myself.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.540
Please, milord, spare my life.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.250
Utter ruin...

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.590
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.400
You're no match for Mistress.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.000
Very well.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.470
Give Lord Luo more challenge.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.710
What kind of challenge?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.520
So light as this, right?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.000
Like ants moving house.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.860
Keep adding on.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.970
More, more, quickly.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.810
Yes, sir.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.680
Add a little extra.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.390
Marquis, you're truly wise.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.710
Your wisdom surpasses mine.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.680
Not at all.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.270
Still won't speak?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.080
Lord Luo, you're a true man.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.530
Then I'll trouble you.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.390
Please move all these stones back.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.680
You've got all the time to move them.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.030
Hey.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.620
Don't stop now.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.070
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.800
This…

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.850
Mishenfu was brought
from Jingkou Village.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.960
And this Mistress you speak of…

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.040
Is she still there now?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.090
I truly do not know, milord.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.930
Then keep moving.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.460
Spare my life.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.230
Mistress is wise and mighty.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.010
I truly do not know, milord.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120
I truly do not know, truly.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.700
Mm, alright, alright.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.510
I believe you.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.490
That's enough.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.240
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.400
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.480
Come here.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.390
Come on, there's a reward for you.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.160
That's what they call a real disgrace.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.710
Milord.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.840
Enjoy the scenery here.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.510
- Milord, I was wrong.
- Milord, you're wise.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.160
There are wolves up here at night.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.030
Is that so?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.580
- Milord.
- Corrupt official!

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.510
This is your fault.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.020
- I shouldn't have listened to you.
- It's your fault.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.280
Much obliged, milord.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.600
Much obliged, milord.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.120
Many thanks for your timely aid.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.290
Thank you, milord.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.930
- Thanks.
- Think nothing of it.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.680
The Governor's men will escort you back.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.840
Gather at the open ground.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.390
They're waiting over there.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.870
- Thank you, milord.
- Okay.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.040
Much obliged, milord.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.880
Let's move.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.190
What took you so long?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.040
Had you come any later,
you'd have missed me.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.800
What happened to you?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.380
Ugh, I'm sore all over.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.850
I need a massage.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.000
What is massage?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.090
I mean, I need someone to press here.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.220
Exactly, it hurts so bad.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.560
Senior, Heng.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.000
- Did he confess?
- No.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.930
He didn't say a thing.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.310
Only that Mishenfu came
from Jingkou Village.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.440
Marquis, leave this one to me.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.190
Keep that old rogue under close watch.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.680
We're heading east to investigate.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.310
Then you all must be careful.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.310
Once I finish my duties, I'll meet up

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.870
with Marquis, Lord Wang, and Colonel.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.800
Lord Sun,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.160
you can simply call us "you all".

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.230
Makes things much easier.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.600
Oh, you...

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.640
Alright, alright.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.350
I'll take my leave.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.070
My saviors,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.240
my thanks to you three.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.190
It was nothing at all.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.740
Why are you still here?

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.330
Sir,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.860
I am called Lan'er.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.750
I was on my way to find my parents,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.440
but was detained by Lord Luo.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.990
Where are your parents now?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.450
I heard they were taken
to Jingkou Village.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.570
Um.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.510
We are heading there too.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.600
Going alone is not safe.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.870
Let's travel together.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.400
Thank you.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.540
(Jingkou Village, Yuzhang Commandery)

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.390
Look over there.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.120
Are you alright, sir?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.090
Let me help you.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.490
- Greetings, kin.
- We are family.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.560
No need, no need.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.560
Young man,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.490
I must receive Mistress's blessing.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.360
It's not heavy.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.200
Easy there.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.370
Horse Wang.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.020
Brother, I've got a name now.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.140
I've taken his surname.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.200
My name's Scalp Wang.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.810
That's a fine name.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.070
Then I'll take Wang as well

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.190
and go by Horse Wang.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.490
How about you two pick new names?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.860
To serve you with all our might.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.870
We're not changing.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.720
No.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.660
Don't make me look like some old relic.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.400
Alright then.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.480
From today on,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.070
I'm your personal VVIP.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.680
The match is tomorrow.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.870
Do your best out there.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.900
- Sure.
- Got it.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.860
My VVVIP.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.200
What are you doing here?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.590
Long time no see.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.510
The guy
from Changyi's equine administration.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.360
Horse Wang.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.620
And these fine folks are?

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.550
Oh.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.430
I'm Qi Liuhai.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.640
Also from Changyi.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.060
I am De Jiu.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.540
Good, good.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.000
I can see you're all blessed folks.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.750
This is what fate looks like.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.270
Those who come here are family.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.250
Very well.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.800
Where's Scalp Wang?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.510
Don't even mention that rascal.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.330
After the Marquis left Changyi,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400
we too set out on our travels.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.130
We meant to follow the Marquis,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.540
but who would have thought

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.460
we parted ways halfway through.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.280
So where is he now?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.520
And who is this young lady?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.910
I'm Lan'er, here seeking my parents.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.170
What, your parents are in there too?

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.550
Oh dear, really now.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.390
How could one forget their daughter

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.890
for Mistress's blessing?

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.870
Exactly.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.190
Why is it this Mistress again?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320
Here's the thing.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.600
We've long heard
of Mistress's great name.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.240
So we came to seek her blessing.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.870
Yes.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.780
That's right.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.320
Good. That's a fine thing.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.390
Then let's receive Mistress's blessing.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.520
Let's receive the blessing.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.920
- Good.
- Blessing.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.350
Come in, please.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.530
This way, please.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.910
This way, come.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.440
Come, this way.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.560
In Jingkou Village,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.640
all family members
fall into three ranks.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.310
Heaven, Earth, and Mortal.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.470
The first thing upon entering:

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.800
An Emissary will assign your rank.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.820
Busy working, my friends.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.800
People of different ranks

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.330
have their own mission.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.770
- I'm Mortal.
- Greetings, friends.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.590
So I deliver the sacred herb
for Mistress.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.750
You're back.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.670
Earth Rank folks, like them,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.840
grind the sacred herb for Mistress.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.680
Oh.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.560
For Heaven Rank folks,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.310
they serve as Mistress's Emissaries.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.680
Uncle Wang.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.790
These here are...

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.670
They're sincere at heart

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.120
and have endured hardship.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.980
As long as fate allows,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.940
anyone can be part of our family.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.600
Hardship doesn't scare us.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.020
Here, everyone can earn gold.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.840
Heaven Rank can receive
Mistress's blessing,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.010
which will never run out.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.480
Everyone can earn gold?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.280
Who else but the marquis

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.630
would have that much gold?

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.150
Enough chatter, get the ranking set.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.140
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.600
I'm counting on you.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.390
Please notify the Emissary of Mistress.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.660
It mustn't be delayed.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.630
Alright.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.230
Come on. This way, please.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.170
- Come on.
- This way.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.610
Family, please check in.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.460
Much obliged, family.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.320
You may all wait here.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.390
The Emissary will arrive shortly.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.370
Thanks to your kin for passing the word.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.270
Once your rank is set,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.730
you'll be family too.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.910
Yes, of course.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.480
One big family living in harmony.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.320
Yeah.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.760
Hey,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.720
what's the standard for ranking?

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.200
After self-introductions,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.560
the Emissary will decide.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.260
Wait here for a moment.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.360
I'll call everyone over.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.030
They don't seem
under Mishenfu's influence.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.670
It feels more like a joyful village.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.040
Such calmness is what's strange.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.030
Only a Heaven Rank can meet Mistress.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.840
Savior, you want Mistress's blessing too?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840
Don't call me savior.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.960
Just call me Wang.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.390
Anyway,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.600
once we find this Mistress,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.360
you might find your parents too.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.920
Come, over here.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.790
If you want a Heaven Rank,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.640
this self-introduction is important.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.040
So make sure it stands out.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.020
Later, follow exactly what I say

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.300
when introducing yourselves.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.240
Family, gather up, gather up!

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.540
Seeing you all feels so warm.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.640
Western Regions style.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.990
This is the right place.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.580
I once saw people in such garb
in Wucheng Village.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.910
Let's welcome

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.910
(Emissary of Mistress)
four new members to our family.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.890
Applause.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.740
Wonderful.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.400
After rankings are set,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.440
they will officially become

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.780
part of our big family.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.640
Come on.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.910
Please, step up and introduce yourselves.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.280
Alright, welcome.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.440
Greetings, everyone.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.400
I am Qi Liuhai.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.400
I have led a hundred-strong team
in coordinated work.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.120
I'm a natural leader.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.070
I adapt swiftly to new situations,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.520
especially to different work environments.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.020
My resilience under pressure is...

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.580
strong.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.840
I can regain composure
even in adversity

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.450
and swiftly return to peak performance.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.880
In the days to come,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.700
I shall give my utmost and live up to

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.030
all expectations.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.910
Excellent!

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.630
Choose me, Qi Liuhai,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.260
and tasks will be finished smoothly.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.820
Excellent!

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.780
Alright, come on.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.750
Next candidate, please.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.130
Not bad at all.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.550
Excellent, excellent.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.700
Dear family members,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.190
greetings to you all.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.540
I am Wang Heng.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.960
I've studied under renowned teachers,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.200
mastering poetry, prose,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.390
astronomy and geography.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.750
I've made great achievements.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.120
Amazing!

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.270
At the same time,

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.870
I have served several prestigious clans

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.600
and led teams of many members.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.720
I excel in teamwork and leadership.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.670
Impressive!

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.130
I believe that in the work ahead,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.630
I can lead everyone efficiently

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.640
and achieve our mission with brilliance.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.010
Family, dear family,

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.840
choose me, Wang Heng,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.460
and it will be lively and full of charm.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.420
Wonderful, wonderful.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.260
Come on, let's welcome the next one.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.290
Next up.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.970
Oh, a young lady.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.120
Greetings, everyone.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.400
My name is Lan'er.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.640
I was separated from my family.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.600
Lan'er, Lan'er.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.030
Lan'er.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.320
Cry, come on.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.790
Cry.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.220
Anyway, I'm glad to join you.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.660
Good.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.610
Come on.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.370
Let's invite the fourth one.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.800
My name's De Jiu.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.760
Nothing much to say.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.410
I'll handle things as they come.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.080
Good.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.120
I'm the most obedient here.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.510
I knew it would turn out like this.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.110
- We have to count on ourselves
- Here are

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.910
- to uncover the truth.
- the results.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.790
Let's welcome

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.870
the four candidates.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.240
Alright.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.160
Lan'er, De Jiu,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.750
Earth Rank.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.890
Good!

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.330
Even that gets Earth Rank.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.130
Then we must be Heaven Rank.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.510
Qi Liuhai, Wang Heng,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.870
Mortal Rank.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.400
Good!

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.850
What did you say?

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.420
Mortal Rank is fine.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.960
Mortal Rank is fine, really.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:46.960
Mortal Rank is fine.
