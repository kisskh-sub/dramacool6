Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.830
Do you speak English? Please, get someone who can speak English.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.020
I can help. What's your emergency? Fire or ambulance?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.640
My daughter is going into anaphylactic shock.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.040
I need to get her to the hospital right now!

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.440
- Got it.
- Was it a food allergy?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.930
- Where are you?
- It's a restaurant in Chinatown.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.120
The name is... "Ryuenkan."

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.010
Ryuenkan in Chinatown, right?
[Yamashitacho]

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.640
Right.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.140
Got it. Was the anaphylactic shock triggered by food?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.210
She has a peanut allergy.
[Anaphylatic, Peanut]

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.780
- Is she conscious?
- Yeah.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.630
B-But her body is turning red, and... and she's breathing heavily.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.280
If food triggered the shock, ask if they have an EpiPen.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.780
Right. Do you have an EpiPen?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.050
I left it at the hotel.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.900
Okay. Just hold on.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.790
The shock is affecting her skin and breathing.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.710
- They have no EpiPen.
- Copy that.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.670
The ambulance is on the way. Is she still breathing?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.810
A "Foreign Language Paramedic Squad"?

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.320
Yes. They'll assist folks who cannot speak Japanese.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.110
We've decided to follow the Tokyo Fire Department's example

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.610
and implement the service as well.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.470
And Niijima-san was chosen as one of our founding members?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.200
- Yes.
- That's amazing!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.250
I suppose, yes.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.290
So, you'll be transferring to another department come April?

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.900
Yes.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.210
I see.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.310
- What?
- Don't get disappointed.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.660
Speaking of transfers, Uesugi-kun is moving ahead of her.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.570
Today is the last day of his job rotation.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.330
Thank you for having me here.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.110
Why do you sound happy to leave?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.870
"Happy"? No, of course not!

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.280
- I would've loved to stay longer.
- Then stay.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.110
That'd be a bit...

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.500
Why not? Stay with us!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.690
- Well...
- Then promise you'll come back.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.220
- No, well...
- Why

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.200
- If you leave for SR as well, Kaneshita-san,
- don't you want to stay here?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.860
I guess Squad 3 is in for a drastic change.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.190
Kaneshita-san?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.830
- Yes.
- Before I forget, there's one other announcement.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.490
We suspect an arsonist is behind the recent fire

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.810
that broke out in an empty home in Kanagawa Ward.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.200
That makes a number of cases now.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.600
The police are asking for our cooperation,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920
so if you're even slightly suspicious about a fire call, please inform them.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.850
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.100
You can hear a sound?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.320
Yes, it's been persisting for a while now.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.370
I'm home and it just keeps roaring, like a ventilation fan.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.800
I can't even get any proper sleep.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.860
Perhaps the fan is from a neighboring unit.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660
No, it only sounds like a fan.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.770
I think it's technically called an infrasound.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.240
Anyway, I wish other people could hear it, but...

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.650
I'm troubled because I'm the only one who can hear it.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.910
And this noise is causing your health to deteriorate?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.840
- Shall I send an ambulance your way?
- No, no.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.770
What did you say your name was again?

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.690
My name?

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.000
- It's Uesugi.
- Uesugi-san,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.260
were you even listening to a word I said?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.480
Yes, I intended to be listening.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.310
Then why would you suggest an ambulance?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.430
I want you folks to look into this sound and put a stop to it!

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.960
Terribly sorry, Ma'am, but we do not handle cases of this sort.

Fine, whatever. Useless!

Some cardboard left there is burning.

- Yes.

Do you know whose residence that would be?

But there is a "for sale" sign out front. I believe the building is empty.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.740
The house to the right belongs to the Ishino-sans; the Taki-sans are to the front.

Thank you for the information.

Yes, it is.

The fire is burning quite intensely, and smoke is rising as well.

I understand.

There's a senior living center nearby.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.740
They should own a fire extinguisher.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.680
Though we've sent a fire truck,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.670
can you or anyone nearby cooperate with extinguishing the flame?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.020

I'm glad it was only a small fire though.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.520
If the first call had been a few minutes later, the fire might have spread farther.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.410
I heard the caller gave really precise information.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.850
Yeah.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.130
I just wonder why he suddenly hung up like that.

- Hey there.
- Hello.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.090
Oh, you reminded me.

Why do I have to tag along?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.060
I thought bringing a former firefighter along

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.810
would help me understand the incident better.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.970
This is the house.

Thank goodness it didn't get any worse than this.

With roads as narrow as this,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.370
if the house had caught fire, it could have spread to the neighbors.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.010
Are you two with the police?

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.850
No.

I was so shocked when I returned from shopping and noticed it.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.410
Ma'am, did you see anyone else in the vicinity of the fire?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.780
- "Anyone else"?
- Yes.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.240
No, I was alone when I arrived.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.210
But perhaps it was that individual.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.560
Yesterday, just before I witnessed the fire, I bumped into him at that corner there.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.960
Gosh, I'm terribly sorry, Dear.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.780
And this individual was limping?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.320
He was.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.340
About how old do you reckon the person was?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.230
He was certainly young; that I can tell you.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.960

Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.190
A fire at 1-9 Kihamacho, Naka Ward. It's happening in front of a home.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.880
Some cardboard left there is burning.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.070
Do you know whose residence that would be?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.700
No, there's no nameplate.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.500
When reporting a fire, giving the exact location is the most important thing.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.650
And this person knew that.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.210
The Taki-sans are to the front.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.090
Maybe he works for a fire department himself.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.610
But if that were the case...

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.880

Hey, Kasuhara.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.150

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.120
Right.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.120
The person who called is used to dealing with fires.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.900
He's possibly someone who works for a fire department, I believe.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:36.250
But if that were the case, why did he hang up when asked to extinguish the fire?

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.660
He didn't want to extinguish the fire.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.700
That's the only reason I can think of.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.740
In other words, the guy who called first is our arsonist.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.870
He's used to calling and reporting fires because he has repeatedly done the same thing.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.580
Of course, that's only a theory of mine.

- Yes, Ma'am.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.920
I guess Detective Minowa-san's theory was incorrect.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.550
Say, where's Kaneshita-san today?

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.180
I heard he took a paid day off.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.470
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.030
Fire, fire!

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.900
"Fire"? What's on fire, Ma'am?
[Emergency]

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.440
A house! A whole house is on fire!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.830
- Do you see any flames or smoke?
- Yes.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.380
There's so much fire everywhere!

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.740
I understand. Please tell us where to send our firefighters.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.160
This is 3-26-5 Misatocho, Nishi Ward.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.070
"3-26-5 Misatocho, Nishi Ward"?

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.930
Yes.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.450
If there were a fourth fire...

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.970
- Misatocho, in the Nishi Ward?
- Specifically, in District 3.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.750
Is it your home on fire?

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.300
No, I only happened to pass by. Please hurry!

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.570
Understood.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.760
[Dispatch]

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.500
Niijima-san, 3-26-5 was another empty home.
[Property for Sale]

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.730
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.840
- Hello?
- Our firefighters are on their way.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.440
Could you assist us with extinguishing the fire?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.900
Of course not! That's why I'm calling you.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.110
I understand.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.790
- In that case, please wait from a distance, and...
- Excuse me.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.620
- Yes?
- This may not be relevant,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.540
but I saw a suspicious man come out of this place before the fire erupted.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.530
"A suspicious man"?

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.700
Yes. Should I call the police as well?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.460
Please do. We'll be sure to inform the police on our end as well.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.920
Okay. Then please hurry.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.580
Before you go, may I get your nameâ€”

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.420
Niijima-san, contact the police. I'll update the firefighters on the situation.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.940
Right.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.660
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.020
Kasuhara, is that you?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.890
Kaneshita-san?

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.430
Why are you calling?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.940
More importantly, there's a fire! Prepare for the address.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.090
Go ahead.
[Emergency]

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.110
It's 3-24-13 Misatocho, Nishi Ward. The fire is by a house.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.940
It's 3-24-13 Misatocho, Nishi Ward?

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.250
Another fire in District 3 of Misato.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.750
Some trash is in flames on the property.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.180
With the amount of mail here, I'd guess this is another empty house.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.620
I understand.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.490
We also got a report of a fire at 3-26-5 in Misatocho.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.770
Just to confirm, your address is 3-24-13, yes?

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.800
- Yes, I'm certain.
- Okay, I'll send a squad your way.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.020
[Dispatch]

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:07.740
Sir, we've sent all nearby squads to the fire at 3-26-5.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.450
- It may take a while for someone to arrive.
- Got it.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:15.670
Minowa-kun, there's been a fire at 3-24-13 Misatocho, also in Nishi Ward.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.960
Convey that information to your squads as well.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.020
Roger that.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.000
I'll call again when I've managed to extinguish the fire a bit.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.410
Yes, Sir.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.060
Fire! There's a fire!

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.850
Does anyone have an extinguisher on hand?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.530
Fire! Does anyone have an extinguisher?

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.880
Damn it.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.550
We haven't heard back from Kaneshita yet, right?

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.910
No, Ma'am.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.460
Excuse me!

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.600
Here.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.980
Is it extinguished?

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.180
Yes, but thank you.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.760
That must've been quite the flame...

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.320
South Squad to Yokohama Fire. Come in.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.340
We hear you, South.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.520
We've arrived at the empty home at 3-26-5 Misatocho.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.910
However, we see no fire and no evidence of any burning either.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.280
We'll continue investigating the area,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.270
but we request you check back with the caller.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.210
Copy that, South.
[Calling]

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.190
Niijima-san... You're already on it.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.760
I can't get through to her.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.150
Was it a false report?

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.820
She may have gotten the address wrong.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.670
- Call her back a couple more times.
- I got it.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.510
- Yokohama Fire Bureau, this is Hodogaya Squad.
- Hodogaya, go ahead.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.850
We've arrived at the empty home at 3-24-13 Misatocho.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.570
There is evidence of a fire here that has already been extinguished.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:28.030
However, we haven't managed to make contact with Dispatcher Kaneshita.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.210
If you hear from him, please send word to us as well.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.020
- Copy that, Hodogaya.
- Kasuhara-san, call Kaneshita.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.520
Yes, Ma'am.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.840
Yes?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.620
Kaneshita-san, where are you right now?

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.400
I'm about 100 meters north of the intersection

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.450
in District 3 of Wakabadai, along Courthouse Street.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.510
What brought you there?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.180
I saw someone suspicious near the fire's location.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.760
What?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.250
He could be the arsonist.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.040
Wait, then you're tailing this suspicious person?

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.200
Yeah.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.160
Why would you do such a thing?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.100
Kasuhara, you said so yourself.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.720
We must do all we can to prevent the fires we can, right?

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.230
Well, I agree with you.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.400
[Interject]

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.530
Kaneshita, stop.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.460
- You're a dispatcher, not aâ€”
- I can't waste an emergency line. I'll disconnect.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.680
Unbelievable.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.930
[Telephone Number]

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.830
This number is not currently in use.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:52.000
The number of the first woman who called is no longer in use.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.200
- How is that possible?
- She may have canceled her phone plan.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.170
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.120
Kasuhara, it's me.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.120
Kaneshita-san called back.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.020
There's been another fire.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.800
The address is 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.250
It broke out inside a deserted building.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.790
A deserted building at 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.800
And I was right.
[Dispatch]

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.750
The man I was chasing was the arsonist.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.360
- What?
- Building fire.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.210
It seems he planned all his stunts in this building too.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.030
There are loads of flammables right by the fire.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.170
I'll attempt to extinguish the fire, but get the police and firefighters hereâ€”

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.860
Kaneshita-san?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.440
Hello?

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.750
It was you, wasn't it?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.730
You're the one behind these fires.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.630
Did he...

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.620
He may be confronting the man he was tailing.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.670
Keep listening to their conversation.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.290
Yes, Ma'am.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.480
Answer me.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.270
I don't know who the hell you are,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.030
but I'm just burning heaps of trash.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.520
No one has died, so what's the big issue?

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.270
It's not a matter of casualties!

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.570
Yogo-kun, contact the police.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.550
- Request that they go there immediately.
- Right.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.830
- Have an ambulance accompany them as well.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.610
Let me go!

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.030
Hey, look. The fire's only going to spread, you know?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.220
Hey, wait!

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.470
Kaneshita-san, are you all right?

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.340
Kaneshita-san?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.180
What is this sound?

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.920
[Muted]

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.180
It's the sound of someone running.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.640
Is he running after the culprit?

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.550
He just got on a bicycle!

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.500
"A bicycle"?

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.860
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.260
Fire. Fire!

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.170
The abandoned building behind my place is smoking!

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.330
A fire in an abandoned building. Could I get your address please?

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.180
R-Right. It's 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.040
No one has lived there for a decade, though.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.640
"2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward," yes?

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.780
We've already dispatched a squad to deal with this fire.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.970
- Please stay away from the fire, andâ€”
- W-Wait!

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.120
Someone just came out.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.460
Does anyone have a fire extinguisher?

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.360
Lad, are you okay?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.020
Yes, but do you have a fire extinguisher?

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.730
"A fire extinguisher"? I'll go grab the one from my place!

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.980
Please, thank you. A fire truck is already headed this way.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.500
You heard the man. I'll hang up now!

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.390
That was Kaneshita-san's voice, right?

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.420
I agree. So who's on the call with Kasurhara-san?

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.070
Kasuhara-san,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.700
did you hear Kaneshita's voice from your end as well?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.330
No. I hear only the sound of someone biking.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.350
Then what we're hearing now is...

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.180
The sound of the perpetrator running away.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.530
[119]

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.620
Kaneshita-san must have planted his phone on him.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.790
Hey, look. The fire's only going to spread, you know?

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.210
[119]

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.720
What a stunt Kaneshita-san pulled off!

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.300
But our systems can't track a phone via GPS.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.050
Maybe he thought Kasuhara-san could track down the perpetrator through sound alone.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.070

The fire has already been extinguished,

He is unharmed and requires no paramedic aid.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.980
Suspect Hasegawa Yota, 27, was arrested for setting fire

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.710
to several abandoned buildings and homes.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.940
He has also confessed to setting the fires in Yokohama,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.280
stating he was "only messing around and doing it for fun."

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.540
Police will investigate any further offenses he may have committed.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:35.280
It seems Detective Minowa-san's theory was on point after all!

I won't deny that,

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.860

- On to our next headline.
- Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

Is Kaneshita-san testifying to the police again?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.590
Yes. He'll return once he's done.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.360
I can't believe crazy people like that exist.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.880
I mean, setting fires "for fun"? That's just insane.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.600
Is everything all right?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.860
Yes, it's just...

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:16.280
I actually... crossed paths with the perpetrator the other day.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.490
And if I recall correctly...

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.310
I know. I'll definitely do it in a couple days.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.750
He was speaking to someone over the phone.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.520
Does that mean he has an accomplice?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.740
That reminds me. What happened to the first woman who called?

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.190
Did we ever figure that out?

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:45.900
No, but Team Leader said she'd file a report about her to the police.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.510
It ended earlier than expected, so I'm headed straight to the Bureau.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.840
See you later.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.080

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.880
I saw the news and couldn't help but be curious.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.050
I didn't think I'd actually run into you though.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.750
Sorry.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.630
Why are you apologizing, Shiomi?

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.760
If anything, I'm the one who should apologize.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:34.120
It was my fault you had to quit being a firefighter two years ago.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.000
I've been worrying about you, but I've never even reached out.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.200
I'm sorry.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.140
Please, raise your head.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:56.110
It was never your fault, Kaneshita-san.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.620
To tell you the truth...

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:09.390
Even before the accident, my hands wouldn't stop shaking whenever I was dispatched.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.930
Central, Mihama Ward.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.190
I was scared of fires.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.980
But my grandfather and father were both firefighters.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.130
I could never tell them flames terrified me.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.690
So, when the accident happened,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.710
I was relieved to finally have a reason to quit in style.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.590
I'm... sorry.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.980
Like I said, there's no need for you to apologize.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.950
But when I made that call the other day,

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:55.090
as a former firefighter, I should've helped extinguish that fire, and yet...

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.530
I couldn't help but be terrified.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.260
I'll leave the rest to you folks.

I see.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.070
The other day, one of my old firefighting mates

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.450
told me you had left to become a dispatcher.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.040
And it got me thinking.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.410
What if you were still hung up on what happened to me?

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.330
But I didn't have courage to confirm with you in person.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.540
Shiomi?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:41:01.120
If you're bothered by what happened to me, you don't need to be.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.290
You had nothing to do with my choice.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.040
Actually, I work at a nursing home right now.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.420
It suits me, I guess. It's been fun working there.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:19.130
So, if you ever want to head back out as a firefighter,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.980
I hope you do so whenever you feel ready.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:27.850
I'll be rooting for you, as a citizen living out there.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.650

However, we cannot catch stray cats.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.610
I'd suggest inquiring with your local town hall instead.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:14.190
But your staff caught the culprit of those fires, didn't he?

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.450
I'm sure catching a stray is easier than that.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:21.870
Well, that was... a special exception.
