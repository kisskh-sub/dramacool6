00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.640
My daughter is going into anaphylactic shock.

I need to get her to the hospital right now!

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.440
- Got it.
- Was it a food allergy?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.930
- Where are you?
- It's a restaurant in Chinatown.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.120
The name is... "Ryuenkan."

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.010
Ryuenkan in Chinatown, right?

Right.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.140
Got it. Was the anaphylactic shock triggered by food?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.210
She has a peanut allergy.
[Anaphylatic, Peanut]

- How old is she?
- Sixteen.

- Is she conscious?
- Yeah.

B-But her body is turning red, and... and she's breathing heavily.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.280
If food triggered the shock, ask if they have an EpiPen.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.780
Right. Do you have an EpiPen?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.050
I left it at the hotel.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.900
Okay. Just hold on.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.790
The shock is affecting her skin and breathing.

- They have no EpiPen.
- Copy that.

We suspect an arsonist is behind the recent fire

that broke out in an empty home in Kanagawa Ward.

That makes a number of cases now.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.600
The police are asking for our cooperation,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920

Yes, it's been persisting for a while now.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.370
I'm home and it just keeps roaring, like a ventilation fan.

I can't even get any proper sleep.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.860
Perhaps the fan is from a neighboring unit.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660
No, it only sounds like a fan.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.770
I think it's technically called an infrasound.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.240
Anyway, I wish other people could hear it, but...

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.650

- No, no.

were you even listening to a word I said?

Yes, I intended to be listening.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.310
Then why would you suggest an ambulance?

I thought bringing a former firefighter along

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.810
would help me understand the incident better.

With roads as narrow as this,

About how old do you reckon the person was?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.230
He was certainly young; that I can tell you.

No, there's no nameplate.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.500
When reporting a fire, giving the exact location is the most important thing.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.650
And this person knew that.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.210
The Taki-sans are to the front.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.090
Maybe he works for a fire department himself.

Right.

The person who called is used to dealing with fires.

He's possibly someone who works for a fire department, I believe.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:36.250
But if that were the case, why did he hang up when asked to extinguish the fire?

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.660
He didn't want to extinguish the fire.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.700
That's the only reason I can think of.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.740
In other words, the guy who called first is our arsonist.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.870
He's used to calling and reporting fires because he has repeatedly done the same thing.

Of course, that's only a theory of mine.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.920
I guess Detective Minowa-san's theory was incorrect.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.550
Say, where's Kaneshita-san today?

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.180
I heard he took a paid day off.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.470
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.030
Fire, fire!

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.900
"Fire"? What's on fire, Ma'am?
[Emergency]

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.440
A house! A whole house is on fire!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.830
- Do you see any flames or smoke?
- Yes.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.380
There's so much fire everywhere!

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.740
I understand. Please tell us where to send our firefighters.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.160
This is 3-26-5 Misatocho, Nishi Ward.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.070
"3-26-5 Misatocho, Nishi Ward"?

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.930
Yes.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.450
If there were a fourth fire...

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.970
- Misatocho, in the Nishi Ward?
- Specifically, in District 3.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.750
Is it your home on fire?

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.300
No, I only happened to pass by. Please hurry!

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.570
Understood.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.760
[Dispatch]

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.500
Niijima-san, 3-26-5 was another empty home.
[Property for Sale]

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.730
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.840
- Hello?
- Our firefighters are on their way.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.440
Could you assist us with extinguishing the fire?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.900
Of course not! That's why I'm calling you.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.110
I understand.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.790
- In that case, please wait from a distance, and...
- Excuse me.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.620
- Yes?
- This may not be relevant,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.540
but I saw a suspicious man come out of this place before the fire erupted.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.530
"A suspicious man"?

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.700
Yes. Should I call the police as well?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.460
Please do. We'll be sure to inform the police on our end as well.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.920
Okay. Then please hurry.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.580
Before you go, may I get your name—

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.420
Niijima-san, contact the police. I'll update the firefighters on the situation.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.940
Right.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.660
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.020
Kasuhara, is that you?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.890
Kaneshita-san?

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.430
Why are you calling?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.940
More importantly, there's a fire! Prepare for the address.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.090
Go ahead.
[Emergency]

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.110
It's 3-24-13 Misatocho, Nishi Ward. The fire is by a house.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.940
It's 3-24-13 Misatocho, Nishi Ward?

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.250
Another fire in District 3 of Misato.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.750
Some trash is in flames on the property.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.180
With the amount of mail here, I'd guess this is another empty house.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.620
I understand.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.490
We also got a report of a fire at 3-26-5 in Misatocho.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.770
Just to confirm, your address is 3-24-13, yes?

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.800
- Yes, I'm certain.
- Okay, I'll send a squad your way.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.020
[Dispatch]

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:07.740
Sir, we've sent all nearby squads to the fire at 3-26-5.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.450
- It may take a while for someone to arrive.
- Got it.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:15.670
Minowa-kun, there's been a fire at 3-24-13 Misatocho, also in Nishi Ward.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.960
Convey that information to your squads as well.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.020
Roger that.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.000
I'll call again when I've managed to extinguish the fire a bit.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.410
Yes, Sir.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.060
Fire! There's a fire!

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.850
Does anyone have an extinguisher on hand?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.530
Fire! Does anyone have an extinguisher?

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.880
Damn it.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.550
We haven't heard back from Kaneshita yet, right?

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.910
No, Ma'am.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.460
Excuse me!

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.600
Here.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.980
Is it extinguished?

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.180
Yes, but thank you.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.760
That must've been quite the flame...

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.320
South Squad to Yokohama Fire. Come in.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.340
We hear you, South.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.520
We've arrived at the empty home at 3-26-5 Misatocho.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.910
However, we see no fire and no evidence of any burning either.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.280
We'll continue investigating the area,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.270
but we request you check back with the caller.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.210
Copy that, South.
[Calling]

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.190
Niijima-san... You're already on it.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.760
I can't get through to her.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.150
Was it a false report?

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.820
She may have gotten the address wrong.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.670
- Call her back a couple more times.
- I got it.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.510
- Yokohama Fire Bureau, this is Hodogaya Squad.
- Hodogaya, go ahead.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.850
We've arrived at the empty home at 3-24-13 Misatocho.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.570
There is evidence of a fire here that has already been extinguished.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:28.030
However, we haven't managed to make contact with Dispatcher Kaneshita.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.210
If you hear from him, please send word to us as well.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.020
- Copy that, Hodogaya.
- Kasuhara-san, call Kaneshita.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.520
Yes, Ma'am.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.840
Yes?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.620
Kaneshita-san, where are you right now?

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.400
I'm about 100 meters north of the intersection

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.450
in District 3 of Wakabadai, along Courthouse Street.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.510
What brought you there?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.180
I saw someone suspicious near the fire's location.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.760
What?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.250
He could be the arsonist.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.040
Wait, then you're tailing this suspicious person?

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.200
Yeah.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.160
Why would you do such a thing?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.100
Kasuhara, you said so yourself.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.720
We must do all we can to prevent the fires we can, right?

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.230
Well, I agree with you.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.400
[Interject]

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.530
Kaneshita, stop.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.460
- You're a dispatcher, not a—
- I can't waste an emergency line. I'll disconnect.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.680
Unbelievable.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.930
[Telephone Number]

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.830
This number is not currently in use.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:52.000
The number of the first woman who called is no longer in use.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.200
- How is that possible?
- She may have canceled her phone plan.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.170
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.120
Kasuhara, it's me.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.120
Kaneshita-san called back.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.020
There's been another fire.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.800
The address is 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.250
It broke out inside a deserted building.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.790
A deserted building at 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.800
And I was right.
[Dispatch]

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.750
The man I was chasing was the arsonist.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.360
- What?
- Building fire.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.210
It seems he planned all his stunts in this building too.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.030
There are loads of flammables right by the fire.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.170
I'll attempt to extinguish the fire, but get the police and firefighters here—

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.860
Kaneshita-san?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.440
Hello?

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.750
It was you, wasn't it?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.730
You're the one behind these fires.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.630
Did he...

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.620
He may be confronting the man he was tailing.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.670
Keep listening to their conversation.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.290
Yes, Ma'am.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.480
Answer me.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.270
I don't know who the hell you are,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.030
but I'm just burning heaps of trash.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.520
No one has died, so what's the big issue?

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.270
It's not a matter of casualties!

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.570
Yogo-kun, contact the police.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.550
- Request that they go there immediately.
- Right.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.830
- Have an ambulance accompany them as well.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.610
Let me go!

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.030
Hey, look. The fire's only going to spread, you know?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.220
Hey, wait!

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.470
Kaneshita-san, are you all right?

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.340
Kaneshita-san?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.180
What is this sound?

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.920
[Muted]

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.180
It's the sound of someone running.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.640
Is he running after the culprit?

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.550
He just got on a bicycle!

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.500
"A bicycle"?

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.860
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.260
Fire. Fire!

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.170
The abandoned building behind my place is smoking!

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.330
A fire in an abandoned building. Could I get your address please?

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.180
R-Right. It's 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.040
No one has lived there for a decade, though.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.640
"2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi Ward," yes?

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.780
We've already dispatched a squad to deal with this fire.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.970
- Please stay away from the fire, and—
- W-Wait!

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.120
Someone just came out.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.460
Does anyone have a fire extinguisher?

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.360
Lad, are you okay?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.020
Yes, but do you have a fire extinguisher?

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.730
"A fire extinguisher"? I'll go grab the one from my place!

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.980
Please, thank you. A fire truck is already headed this way.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.500
You heard the man. I'll hang up now!

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.390
That was Kaneshita-san's voice, right?

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.420
I agree. So who's on the call with Kasurhara-san?

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.070
Kasuhara-san,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.700
did you hear Kaneshita's voice from your end as well?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.330
No. I hear only the sound of someone biking.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.350
Then what we're hearing now is...

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.180
The sound of the perpetrator running away.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.530
[119]

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.620
Kaneshita-san must have planted his phone on him.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.790
Hey, look. The fire's only going to spread, you know?

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.210
[119]

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.720
What a stunt Kaneshita-san pulled off!

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.300
But our systems can't track a phone via GPS.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.050
Maybe he thought Kasuhara-san could track down the perpetrator through sound alone.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.070
Kasuhara-san, keep listening. Inform us if you notice anything.

Yes, that jingle is playing on loop.

He is unharmed and requires no paramedic aid.

Suspect Hasegawa Yota, 27, was arrested for setting fire

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.710
to several abandoned buildings and homes.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.940
He has also confessed to setting the fires in Yokohama,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.280
stating he was "only messing around and doing it for fun."

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.540
Police will investigate any further offenses he may have committed.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:35.280
It seems Detective Minowa-san's theory was on point after all!

I won't deny that,

Is Kaneshita-san testifying to the police again?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.590
Yes. He'll return once he's done.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.360
I can't believe crazy people like that exist.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.880
I mean, setting fires "for fun"? That's just insane.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.600
Is everything all right?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.860
Yes, it's just...

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:16.280
I actually... crossed paths with the perpetrator the other day.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.490
And if I recall correctly...

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.310
I know. I'll definitely do it in a couple days.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.750
He was speaking to someone over the phone.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.520
Does that mean he has an accomplice?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.740
That reminds me. What happened to the first woman who called?

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.190
Did we ever figure that out?

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:45.900
No, but Team Leader said she'd file a report about her to the police.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.510
It ended earlier than expected, so I'm headed straight to the Bureau.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.840
See you later.

I saw the news and couldn't help but be curious.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.050
I didn't think I'd actually run into you though.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.750
Sorry.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.630
Why are you apologizing, Shiomi?

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.760
If anything, I'm the one who should apologize.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:34.120
It was my fault you had to quit being a firefighter two years ago.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.000
I've been worrying about you, but I've never even reached out.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.200
I'm sorry.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.140
Please, raise your head.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:56.110
It was never your fault, Kaneshita-san.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.620
To tell you the truth...

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:09.390
Even before the accident, my hands wouldn't stop shaking whenever I was dispatched.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.930
Central, Mihama Ward.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.190
I was scared of fires.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.980
But my grandfather and father were both firefighters.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.130
I could never tell them flames terrified me.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.690
So, when the accident happened,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.710
I was relieved to finally have a reason to quit in style.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.590
I'm... sorry.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.980
Like I said, there's no need for you to apologize.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.950
But when I made that call the other day,

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:55.090
as a former firefighter, I should've helped extinguish that fire, and yet...

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.530
I couldn't help but be terrified.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.260

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.070
The other day, one of my old firefighting mates

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.450
told me you had left to become a dispatcher.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.040
And it got me thinking.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.410
What if you were still hung up on what happened to me?

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.330
But I didn't have courage to confirm with you in person.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.540
Shiomi?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:41:01.120
If you're bothered by what happened to me, you don't need to be.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.290
You had nothing to do with my choice.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.040
Actually, I work at a nursing home right now.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.420
It suits me, I guess. It's been fun working there.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:19.130
So, if you ever want to head back out as a firefighter,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.980
I hope you do so whenever you feel ready.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:27.850
I'll be rooting for you, as a citizen living out there.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.650

However, we cannot catch stray cats.

I'd suggest inquiring with your local town hall instead.

But your staff caught the culprit of those fires, didn't he?

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.450
I'm sure catching a stray is easier than that.
