Soma-kun's talks on low-body temperature.

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:09.533
In England, there's a saying that goes, "Cold hands, warm heart."

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:13.600
It means that if your hands are cold, you're probably a warm person.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.400
The custom of shaking hands started around there too.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.992
People like me with cold hands tend to hold back from shaking hands

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:28.336
because we don't want to transmit the cold.

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:33.633
But even with cold hands, if you communicate with a warm heart,

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.666
it'll warm things and break the ice naturally.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:43.700

- Right.
- Let's do our best.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.400
Back to what you were saying, you changed jobs to this one, Takamine-san?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.534
No, Hata-chan! You were headhunted to be exact, right?

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:34.400
They actually reached out to me, but I was seeking a step up.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.867
- Wow. That's so cool!
- Oh, you're amazing!

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:38.834
- That's impressive since you're so young!
- I'm so jealous!

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:41.867
- Got any advice for me?
- What do you mean?

00:14:41.867 --> 00:14:43.734
- The meat is cooked.
- Thanks!

00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:45.134
Thank you!

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.467
Eat up. This one's almost done.

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:50.200
Awesome.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.634
The chief isn't here?

00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:57.000
His son had a baseball game. You could have missed, too.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.201
Not at all. This is way more refreshing than the usual desk job!

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:06.667
And I can see Uehara-san and Hata-chan having fun.

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:08.667
Oh, good.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.734
I'll go order more drinks.

00:15:12.734 --> 00:15:15.867
- Really? I'll have another highball.
- Okay.

00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:18.734
- Takamine-san?
- The same.

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:21.100
- Plum wine with soda water.
- Got it.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.849
- I'll go.
- It's fine; you eat up.

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:29.634
- Thanks!
- No problem.

00:15:32.967 --> 00:15:34.515
Want some?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.000
Yes, please.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.334
Those look almost done.

00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:41.667
- Looks so delicious!
- Looks good!

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:44.134
I want that sausage.

00:15:44.134 --> 00:15:46.800
- Beer, highball, and fizzy plum wine.
- That's right.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.534
Some napkins too, please.

00:15:48.534 --> 00:15:51.034
- Okay, one moment.
- Thank you.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.640
Hey, Ogata.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.534
Takamine-kun?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.772
- Soma-kun, have you even touched anything yet?
- Open wide.

00:16:01.772 --> 00:16:03.500
- I will...
- I knew you would do that.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:09.334
Hey, how about we do that thing... the Frisbee.

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:11.034
- Yes!
- Heck, yes!

00:16:11.034 --> 00:16:12.772
- Let's all do it together.
- Yes, let's.

00:16:12.772 --> 00:16:14.474
- Let's do it.
- I want to do it.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.169
It's like dodgeball.

00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:18.759
Frisbee, I mean.

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:21.986
Like dodgeball, you throw the Frisbee. Don't you know?

00:16:21.986 --> 00:16:24.151
I feel like playing dodgeball, too.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.519
"Dodgeball"?

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.239
Dodge-bee?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.930
I want us to have a good work relationship

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.080
so I just wanted to clear the air.

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:40.367
So I'll ask frankly...

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.767
Well...

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:48.000
Back in high school, did I do something?

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.000
It bothered me for ages.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.667
One day, you just started avoiding me.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.989
If I did something...

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.736
I want to apologize, though it's too late.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.934
I didn't know he felt that way.

00:17:12.934 --> 00:17:16.380
I could just smile and let it slide,

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:22.600
but it's time to say goodbye to these pent-up feelings.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.450
Back then,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:36.730
you were mocking my figure with your friend.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.700
I was shocked to hear that.

00:17:42.234 --> 00:17:46.134
I didn't want to get hurt so I ran away.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.934
- I'm sorry I avoided you.
- Don't!

00:17:54.934 --> 00:17:58.500
I'm sorry, too.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.734
It was likely because my friends mocked our friendship.

00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:07.111
I didn't want to get teased.

00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:09.711
So that's why...

00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:13.270
I play just Frisbee.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.120
So let's play Frisbee.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.167
My careless words hurt you.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.280
I'm so sorry.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.167
No, I shouldn't have avoided you like that.

00:18:40.167 --> 00:18:42.100
I guess, we're even.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.734
Gosh, I'm glad that's all out now.

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:55.480
I'm glad, too.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.200
Oh, right.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.967
Since we're back to being friends, can I have your number?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.667
Sure, of course.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.027
Here.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.337
I sent you a sticker.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.234
I can't believe you sent me such things. It's cute.

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:31.434
It's how I really feel.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.134
Kotori-san!

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:41.283
Soma-kun?

00:19:41.283 --> 00:19:44.700
Did he just call me Kotori-san?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.643
What are you doing?

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.067
Wh-What's up with this vibe?

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.034
We went to high school together.

00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:04.034
We just got excited discussing olden days.

00:20:04.034 --> 00:20:05.480
Right?

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:09.067
What? Oh yes.

00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:13.267
Soma-san, I hear you're a great engineer.

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:17.567
I anticipate working with you.

00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:23.650
You have cold hands.

00:20:24.434 --> 00:20:26.500
Not a problem.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.767
I'll go back to everyone else then.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.367
Soma-kun?

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.667
It's him, isn't it?

00:20:51.867 --> 00:20:58.270
About your painful memory, is he the one who hurt you?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.567
Soma-kun acts differently somehow.

00:21:03.567 --> 00:21:05.734
Well...

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:08.960
Yes.

00:21:09.734 --> 00:21:13.134
So why did you give him your number?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.867
Are you okay?

00:21:17.334 --> 00:21:24.167
I don't care how long ago or why it happened.

00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:32.567
I'll never forgive anyone who hurts you, Kotori-san.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.634
No, no, it's not like that!

00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:43.900
We found out misunderstandings were on both sides.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.067
It's all good now.

00:21:48.234 --> 00:21:49.767
Really?

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.500
Yes.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.367
Apparently, it was bothering him, too.

00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:56.834
And he apologized for it.

00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:01.000
I'm glad I opened up to you.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.067
It made it easier to talk to him.

00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:07.867
I didn't do anything.

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:12.734
You're always the one saving me, Soma-kun.

00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:16.267
Let me treat you to something delicious in return.

00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:21.600
