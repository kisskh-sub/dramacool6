"Desire the Series"

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.600
(Episode 13)

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:39.337
By the way, Mr. Sheng.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:41.573
Your father's medicine this month.

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:45.843
Hua Yong.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:47.979
Are you threatening me?

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:53.918
I mean.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.753
Your father's medicine this month

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:57.489
I've had someone sent to the hospital.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.289
Wait for Mr. Sheng to be free when.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.059
Let's go see uncle together, okay?

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:04.034
Let's talk about it later.

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:29.020
Damn, took the money but didn't do the job.

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:31.856
Are you trying to disappear from the earth?

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:41.031
Second Master.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.534
The flow of funds of the
charity fund since its inception.

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.495
Please cooperate and
provide as soon as possible.

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.874
Damn, the money that's already been spent.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:51.709
Must settle accounts later.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.213
Isn't it just a house that collapsed?

00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:57.148
Is it necessary to be so serious?

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:01.886
It would be great if Sheng Shaoyou died.

00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:07.058
If he dies, there won't be so much trouble.

00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:33.852
My View of Things.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.754
Everything is colored by me.

00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:38.422
No need to thanks.

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:40.225
If you meet someone who bullies you again.

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.751
Stop standing there like an idiot.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.204
If you can't beat them, run away.

00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:44.996
At least you can protect yourself.

00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:10.821
How's the investigation going?

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.089
Already recruited.

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:13.123
It's a murder for hire.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.926
The level is not very good.

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:17.729
It took a little trickery to
expose the mastermind.

00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.496
You guessed it right.

00:04:19.898 --> 00:04:22.167
The mastermind is indeed
from the Sheng family.

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:26.036
Oh?

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.971
Really?

00:04:29.774 --> 00:04:32.510
Keep an eye on this mouse
that wants to eat at the table.

00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.011
Um.

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:36.166
How do you deal with these two people?

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:40.752
Just find a reason to send it in.

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:44.255
Dog that bites.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.723
Once they go in, can't come out anymore

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.426
I understand.

00:04:53.698 --> 00:04:55.466
This year in the field of innovative drugs.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.902
We have completed
eleven major transactions.

00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:00.936
There were six cases where the
amount was disclosed to the public.

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:03.741
In global development
and commercialization.

00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:06.009
In the future, we will try our best to.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.446
Cooperate with overseas
companies with R&D advantages

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:12.182
but.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.552
In the production of radiation enhancers.

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.423
Clinical supply and
initial commercial supply.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.258
We must take the lead in flourishing.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.259
Yes, Mr. Sheng.

00:05:22.594 --> 00:05:24.261
All our transactions this year.

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.807
Neither of them has given up the
leading position in production and supply.

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.498
Only at the level of
clinical outcome analysis

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:29.810
accepted the external cooperation.

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:31.602
In the future, we will conduct research.

00:05:31.603 --> 00:05:34.363
Open up more opportunities for
external communication and cooperation.

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:48.685
Chen Pinming.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.021
Give me an iced Americano.

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:01.432
Give me boiled water.

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:05.503
Why haven't you left yet?

00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:08.605
Where is Chen Pinming?

00:06:09.474 --> 00:06:12.143
Secretary Chen went to
the lab to get the report.

00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:21.852
Mr. Sheng.

00:06:22.553 --> 00:06:24.489
Both hypnotic gas and
hydride are poisonous.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.490
Although I have confirmed with the doctor

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:27.625
it won't be any complications.

00:06:27.892 --> 00:06:29.227
But you just

00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:30.495
can't be that tired.

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.032
How could it really be hydride?

00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:36.768
If it's really poisonous,
can I still sit here?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.170
You won't say anything else like

00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:42.140
permanent marks or something stupid, right?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.643
An advanced alpha is indeed stronger
than ordinary Alphas in all aspects.

00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:49.447
It is also possible to use permanent marking to
make your partner's physique stronger.

00:06:49.647 --> 00:06:50.647
But Mr. Hua.

00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:52.750
I am also an S-level Alpha.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:55.420
How have you marked me?

00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:58.507
It's common sense to take a
rest when you're tired, right?

00:06:58.656 --> 00:06:59.656
Mr. Sheng.

00:06:59.824 --> 00:07:01.626
You can't keep on drinking coffee.

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:04.513
The nights you stay up now
will have to be repaid in the future.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.664
My future?

00:07:07.498 --> 00:07:09.734
Mr. Hua, please don't worry about it.

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:13.171
I don't mean anything else.

00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.772
I just care about you.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.411
Okay, I'll care for you too

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.179
Mr. Hua spent so much effort.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.180
Telling so many lies.

00:07:23.414 --> 00:07:25.083
What do you want from me?

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:26.551
If you just want to play.

00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.086
You should have had enough fun.

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.579
The goal has been achieved, right?

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:31.923
Is there so much free time at X Holdings?

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:34.125
Mr. Hua is actually in charge.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:36.594
Yet you still have the time to
meddle in other people's business.

00:07:39.964 --> 00:07:40.964
For me.

00:07:41.332 --> 00:07:42.633
There's no one like Mr. Sheng.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.669
Mr. Sheng's affairs
are not trivial matters.

00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:45.802
Enough.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.717
Stop beating around the bush with me.

00:07:48.106 --> 00:07:49.307
What do you want?

00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:51.743
Can I stay with you and be your secretary?

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:54.645
Mr. Hua wants to
deign to be my secretary.

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:56.179
Um.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.250
Chen Pinming is loyal.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.585
But not alert enough.

00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:04.988
Not to mention that he can't
stay with you 24 hours a day.

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.890
Why do I need him to stay
by my side 24 hours a day?

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:08.593
If not then who will protect you?

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:09.594
I am an S-level Alpha

00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:11.155
and I still need someone to protect me?

00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:14.164
Um

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.959
Mr. Sheng is soft-hearted.

00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:20.079
You may make enemies
without even knowing it.

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:23.107
What's more, you're easy to deceive.

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:26.744
I'm easy to deceive?

00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:29.747
I didn't mean that.

00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:33.084
I'm just still scared of
the kidnapping incident.

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:36.154
I'm really worried about you being alone.

00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:39.023
Who are you to me?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.025
It's your turn to be worried.

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:49.901
Who am I to you?

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:51.335
Mr. Sheng.

00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:53.203
What do you think?

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:57.675
You fooled me for so long.

00:08:57.676 --> 00:08:58.743
That's enough fun, right?

00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:05.382
Fun?

00:09:06.584 --> 00:09:08.352
I will always be serious about Mr. Sheng.

00:09:09.353 --> 00:09:11.521
I'm worried about you, I
want to protect you

00:09:11.522 --> 00:09:13.291
I will be responsible for you all my life.

00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:18.629
Please give me another chance.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.765
I will repay you with my whole life.

00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:22.466
Please.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.004
I don't need it.

00:10:10.648 --> 00:10:12.049
What do you want to do?

00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:13.651
Isn't that obvious enough?

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:14.952
I want to pursue you

00:10:15.086 --> 00:10:16.220
I'll say it again

00:10:16.354 --> 00:10:17.588
I don't like Alphas.

00:10:17.822 --> 00:10:18.523
Um

00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:19.323
I know.

00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:20.424
What do you know?!

00:10:31.569 --> 00:10:32.569
Mr. Sheng.

00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:34.739
I'm not an Alpha.

00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:37.308
You are not an Alpha.

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:38.609
What are you then?

00:10:40.645 --> 00:10:41.645
Enigma.

00:10:42.647 --> 00:10:44.649
Why don't you say you are Shuke Beta?

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.051
What is Shuke Beta?

00:10:48.052 --> 00:10:50.054
Is he a well-known person
in your JIANGHU area?

00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:52.290
Sorry Mr. Sheng

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.591
I am from Country P.

00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:56.594
Maybe I'm not so familiar
with the people in JIANGHU.

00:10:56.627 --> 00:10:57.795
But I can learn.

00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:05.303
It was my fault for lying before.

00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:06.370
But I really can't think of

00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:08.506
any other way to spend time with you.

00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:15.746
Can you forgive me this time?

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.748
I will never lie to you again.

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:20.785
What do you like about me?

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:23.387
Everything except that you're a player.

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:24.487
You…

00:11:25.623 --> 00:11:26.891
You dare say that?

00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:31.796
Well.

00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:33.196
Hua Yong.

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:35.166
Then I'll give you another chance

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:37.068
And I'll only ask you one time.

00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:38.769
If you lie to me again.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.071
Then get out of here.

00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:41.772
Never show up in front of me again.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.340
OK.

00:11:43.608 --> 00:11:44.608
Ask.

00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:49.013
Was it an accident that you
bumped into me in the hospital?

00:11:50.247 --> 00:11:51.247
No.

00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:57.021
You really have a sister.
at HECI Hospital?

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:58.488
No.

00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:01.192
You made the sister up.

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.097
Who paid for my surgery?

00:12:07.632 --> 00:12:09.166
That's Secretary Gao's sister.

00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:10.266
Gao Tu?

00:12:12.703 --> 00:12:13.703
Hua Yong.

00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:15.972
We are strangers.

00:12:15.973 --> 00:12:17.207
Your identity is fake.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:18.142
The job is fake.

00:12:18.143 --> 00:12:19.510
And also your sister is fake.

00:12:19.744 --> 00:12:22.513
What about you is actually real?

00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:25.116
Loving you is the truth.

00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:28.486
Mr. Sheng.

00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:30.388
My name is Hua Yong, from Country P

00:12:30.588 --> 00:12:31.722
23 years old.

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:34.058
Born on January 11, Capricorn.

00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:35.591
Both of my parents have passed away

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.428
I am the youngest son of my father's line.

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:39.263
Currently working at X Holdings.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.831
Now on vacation.

00:12:40.898 --> 00:12:41.965
Height 1.83 meters.

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.267
Weight 65 kg.

00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:44.635
Hobbies…

00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:49.873
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

00:12:49.874 --> 00:12:51.742
I don't have any hobbies.

00:12:52.543 --> 00:12:53.711
I only like you.

00:12:56.847 --> 00:12:58.681
Have you known me for a long time?

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:02.219
From when?

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:03.854
At a banquet in Country P.

00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:04.988
Country P.

00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:12.730
In the past, other than forums and exhibitions
I've never attended a gathering in Country P.

00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:14.498
How did you...

00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:15.499
Fifteen years ago.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:19.403
Your father took you to a
conference in Country P.

00:13:20.304 --> 00:13:21.872
The JIANGHU Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:23.107 --> 00:13:24.308
How old were you?

00:13:26.844 --> 00:13:28.779
You've liked me since elementary school?

00:13:29.847 --> 00:13:34.051
You left X Holdings and came
all the way to JIANGHU to cheat people.

00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:36.353
Hua Yong, are you a casanova?

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:41.858
Am I some kind panacea, my
body granting you immortality?

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:43.485
Do you think this is reasonable?

00:13:43.794 --> 00:13:44.795
It is.

00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:47.765
I was divided on the day I met Mr. Sheng.

00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:49.366
I was born for you.

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:52.369
I admit.

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:53.737
At the beginning.

00:13:53.738 --> 00:13:55.072
It was just out of curiosity.

00:13:55.673 --> 00:13:57.775
Why is Mr. Sheng different from others?

00:13:58.175 --> 00:13:59.410
In this world.

00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:01.579
Most people speak better than they sing.

00:14:01.912 --> 00:14:03.314
The mouth is righteous.

00:14:03.714 --> 00:14:05.282
In private, people is ruthless.

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:07.343
They do whatever it takes
for the sake of profit.

00:14:09.854 --> 00:14:11.422
But Mr. Sheng is different.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.625
Mr. Sheng has always been very gentle.

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:33.244
Hello, young master.

00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:35.218
Have you been to JIANGHU again?

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.180
Um.

00:14:37.414 --> 00:14:39.126
The head of the family will
return to Country P tomorrow.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
It's likely that everyone will return home.

00:14:41.619 --> 00:14:43.586
You must come back before that happens.

00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:45.381
So that we don't get into trouble.

00:14:48.893 --> 00:14:49.893
Steward Chang.

00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:52.830
No one will know if I'll
return to Country P or not.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.230
Sorry.

00:14:54.532 --> 00:14:55.765
Tomorrow morning before 8 o'clock.

00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:56.901
You must come back.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:58.635
Otherwise

00:14:58.702 --> 00:14:59.836
I'm afraid I won't be able to

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:01.472
let you leave on your own in the future.

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:05.141
Got it.

00:15:21.525 --> 00:15:22.525
Big Brother.

00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:23.693
Don't.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.590
You and I are not born
from the same mother.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.101
Brother, please help me this time.

00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:33.703
Dad would kill me if he knew.

00:15:33.704 --> 00:15:34.704
Sheng Shaoqing.

00:15:35.306 --> 00:15:36.386
How many times has it been now?

00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:39.188
Even though you know that dad will beat you
to death, you still go gambling?

00:15:40.377 --> 00:15:42.412
Brother, I swear

00:15:42.413 --> 00:15:44.548
I will never do it again.

00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:46.584
Please help me this time.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.418
I won't dare tell my mother .

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.154
She'll go crazy if she finds out.

00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:52.121
Can you help me this time?

00:15:52.122 --> 00:15:53.023
I won't go there again.

00:15:53.024 --> 00:15:54.424
You'll never dare to do that again.

00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:56.594
You said the same thing last time.

00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:01.174
I...

00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:04.001
At your big age, you're running off to gamble?

00:16:07.872 --> 00:16:09.305
You're not studying now.

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:10.866
What are you going to do in the future?

00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:13.576
Brother, I really know I was wrong.

00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:15.546
Please help me one last time.

00:16:15.913 --> 00:16:16.913
Please.

00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:22.686
Your coffee, sir.

00:16:23.454 --> 00:16:24.121
Thanks.

00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:25.121
You're welcome.

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:30.494
How can I help you?

00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:32.563
What did the gentleman order?

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.665
An Italian latte.

00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:36.133
The same please.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.300
OK

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:39.669
Thanks.

00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:43.873
How much did you lose?

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:45.175
Eight...

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.377
Eight hundred thousand?

00:16:47.144 --> 00:16:48.645
Brother, don't be angry.

00:16:48.646 --> 00:16:50.780
I want to win.

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.682
Just

00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:53.816
I just had bad luck.

00:16:53.817 --> 00:16:56.220
You, a high school student,
lost 800,000 in a few days.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.887
I'm sorry, bro.

00:16:57.888 --> 00:17:00.324
I'll never go to that kind of place again.

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:01.859
Please help me.

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:03.893
I really can't let dad know about this.

00:17:03.894 --> 00:17:04.927
You know.

00:17:04.928 --> 00:17:06.539
My mother has always been in poor health.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.431
She really will be mad at me.

00:17:08.432 --> 00:17:09.432
Okay, okay.

00:17:09.867 --> 00:17:10.935
Stop crying.

00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:16.373
I have classes later on.

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:18.467
You have to go back to class, too.

00:17:20.244 --> 00:17:23.012
I'll go back to class now.

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:24.715
I'll never go to that kind of place again.

00:17:29.687 --> 00:17:31.522
Then this time...

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:33.290
I will handle it.

00:17:34.224 --> 00:17:35.259
Go back to class.

00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:38.862
Okay, okay, I'll go back now.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:43.167
The seventh time.

00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:49.184
How comes the legitimate heir of a major
family always is soft toward the bastard child?

00:19:11.989 --> 00:19:12.989
Thirteenth Young Master.

00:19:14.324 --> 00:19:15.702
We're going back to the house now?

00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:17.427
Just got some news from the house

00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:18.629
that said you don't have to go.

00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:22.491
Didn't father come back?

00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:26.636
The master has returned.

00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:28.864
But I just came to pass on the message.

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:30.306
He said that many old friends

00:19:30.307 --> 00:19:31.909
were present at today's family banquet.

00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:33.777
So we only invited

00:19:33.844 --> 00:19:36.084
the young masters and young
ladies working in the group.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.115
You don't have to go.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.065
Householder, it's me.

00:20:30.434 --> 00:20:31.434
Come in.

00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:39.576
The fourth master of the family is here.

00:20:43.914 --> 00:20:44.648
Master.

00:20:44.649 --> 00:20:45.816
Don't call me master.

00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:49.486
Although my father gave me
control of BEICHAO Holdings,

00:20:50.254 --> 00:20:52.923
But I never felt I had a
relationship with that family.

00:20:55.526 --> 00:20:56.526
Sorry.

00:20:57.928 --> 00:20:58.928
Boss.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:05.454
Fourth Master has arrived. He said
he needed to see you about something.

00:21:07.137 --> 00:21:07.638
The Fourth Master.

00:21:07.638 --> 00:21:08.238
Get out of the way.

00:21:08.239 --> 00:21:09.372
The boss is busy, you can't go in.

00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:10.874
Where's Hua Yong? I want to see him.

00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:12.009
Get lost.

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.009
The Fourth Master.

00:21:14.678 --> 00:21:15.812
Sorry,

00:21:16.046 --> 00:21:17.046
You can't in.

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:19.883
Kid.

00:21:20.048 --> 00:21:22.019
Where do you get off showing off here?

00:21:22.753 --> 00:21:25.189
When I was fighting with my father.

00:21:25.389 --> 00:21:26.924
You were still playing in the mud here.

00:21:32.362 --> 00:21:33.497
Let him in.

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.267
You guys go out first.

00:21:39.369 --> 00:21:40.369
Yes.

00:21:46.543 --> 00:21:49.780
I made an appointment with you
for two days but I couldn't see you

00:21:50.113 --> 00:21:51.949
I thought you were busy.

00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:53.817
What national affairs are you dealing with?

00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:56.220
Just painting?

00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:58.622
My father's funeral just ended.

00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:02.025
You changed the name of
BEICHAO Holdings immediately.

00:22:02.893 --> 00:22:04.528
Do you want to rebel?

00:22:05.696 --> 00:22:06.696
Brother.

00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:10.133
I remember my father's will.

00:22:10.968 --> 00:22:13.570
I am the only heir to the group's shares.

00:22:14.271 --> 00:22:15.505
It was just a name change.

00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.176
What does it have to do with you?

00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:18.821
Don't fucking mention the will to me.

00:22:19.142 --> 00:22:21.143
Who doesn't know that will

00:22:21.144 --> 00:22:22.646
was manipulated by you?

00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:28.685
All the notary publics and lawyers
worked with you to help you commit perjury.

00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:32.089
Where is the evidence?

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:33.155
Evidence!

00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:37.327
If I had evidence, would
you be fucking sitting there?

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:41.064
So you don't have any then.

00:22:51.475 --> 00:22:52.475
Brother.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.611
You know.

00:22:55.579 --> 00:22:58.715
I hate people who speak
nonsense without evidence.

00:23:08.191 --> 00:23:09.191
Thirteen

00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:12.262
this.

00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:15.332
It's your sweetheart?

00:23:19.303 --> 00:23:21.138
Looks adorable.

00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:24.574
No wonder our little bro likes him.

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:26.509
Give it back to me.

00:23:29.379 --> 00:23:30.747
I'll say it again.

00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.050
Give it back to me.

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:34.551
Give it back to you?

00:23:36.687 --> 00:23:37.821
OK

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600
Here you go.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.888
Do you want to keep your left hand?

00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:14.324
Or right hand?

00:24:30.073 --> 00:24:31.874
Shen Wenlang, the only
person who can be called a friend.

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:33.343
He is often said to be indifferent.

00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:35.545
But Hua Yong disagrees.

00:24:36.513 --> 00:24:39.349
He doesn't understand why people
should be enthusiastic towards others.

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.985
Father, uncles, brothers and sisters.

00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:44.221
Everyone is cunning.

00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:45.988
Deceiving superiors and subordinates.

00:24:45.989 --> 00:24:47.223
Bully the weak but fear the strong.

00:24:47.224 --> 00:24:48.658
Really despicable.

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:51.361
Thats how "close relatives" are.

00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:53.230
Not to mention others.

00:24:54.464 --> 00:24:55.565
As he grew up.

00:24:55.766 --> 00:24:57.633
Hua Yong has met so many people.

00:24:57.634 --> 00:25:00.904
There are many people who
say one thing but do another.

00:25:01.872 --> 00:25:03.907
But then there's Sheng Shaoyou.

00:25:04.908 --> 00:25:07.344
Warm and bright.

00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:10.747
Like the sun hanging high in the blue sky.

00:25:12.048 --> 00:25:14.451
He made Hua Yong, who disdained romance,

00:25:14.684 --> 00:25:16.953
have the urge to be a
star for the first time.

00:25:19.222 --> 00:25:21.424
As long as he can get
close enough to that Alpha.

00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:25.529
He can endure the wind
and cold at high altitudes.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.901
You mean.

00:25:31.568 --> 00:25:33.768
You've been secretly in
love with me for fifteen years?

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:35.304
Yeah.

00:25:35.705 --> 00:25:36.907
You found someone to follow me.

00:25:38.141 --> 00:25:39.142
Also secretly filmed.

00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:40.709
I didn't find anyone.

00:25:41.044 --> 00:25:42.212
I took all the photos myself.

00:25:43.246 --> 00:25:45.015
I don't want others to spy on Mr. Sheng.

00:25:46.183 --> 00:25:47.951
Hua Yong. Are you a fanboy of me?

00:25:48.618 --> 00:25:49.618
Yes.

00:25:51.454 --> 00:25:53.323
The kind that only likes Mr. Sheng.

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:13.844
Mr. Sheng is here.

00:26:58.088 --> 00:26:59.608
What are you doing sleeping in my bed?

00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.261
Mr. Sheng, I can't
sleep well in my bed

00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:06.263
I got used to sleep here every day.

00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:07.963
I won't be able to sleep if I change it.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:14.870
Hua Yong.

00:27:15.372 --> 00:27:16.372
Answer me.

00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:18.775
What happened between you and Shen Wenlang?

00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:24.948
What does Mr. Sheng mean?

00:27:27.651 --> 00:27:29.219
What else could I mean?

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.355
What happened to the injury

00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:34.424
when you came back from Shen Wenlang?

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.861
I did that myself.

00:27:46.569 --> 00:27:49.306
Every rut period will have
mate seeking syndrome

00:27:49.406 --> 00:27:51.942
I found an excuse to leave
because I was afraid of hurting you.

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:53.542
Mate seeking syndrome?

00:27:53.743 --> 00:27:54.743
Um.

00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:58.415
When I see you, I can't
help but want to touch you

00:27:58.648 --> 00:28:00.250
I'll go crazy if I can't see you.

00:28:01.017 --> 00:28:02.218
Because I like you so much.

00:28:08.692 --> 00:28:11.261
Mr. Sheng, it's my fault for lying to you.

00:28:11.928 --> 00:28:13.968
But there is really nothing
between me and Wenlang.

00:28:14.064 --> 00:28:15.632
Don't be jealous of him anymore.

00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:18.634
Who is jealous?

00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:23.573
Smells good.

00:28:29.546 --> 00:28:30.947
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:28:31.414 --> 00:28:33.016
Or do you want me to play along?

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:47.530
You are also a part of HS Group.

00:28:48.098 --> 00:28:49.098
Um.

00:28:49.232 --> 00:28:50.734
H is for Hua Yong.

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.702
S stands for Mr. Sheng.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.740
Does Shen Wenlang know about this?

00:28:57.607 --> 00:28:59.407
It doesn't matter
whether he knows it or not.

00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:01.244
Wenlang is a traitor.

00:29:01.745 --> 00:29:03.889
I provided all the money for
his initial business start-up.

00:29:03.913 --> 00:29:06.282
So I have the final say in HS.

00:29:10.653 --> 00:29:12.333
Have you known each other for a long time?

00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:16.893
When I first met Wen Lang,
he had just lost his father.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.362
Only fourteen years old,
not much older than me.

00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:21.297
Fourteen years old?

00:29:21.765 --> 00:29:23.405
You two are really childhood sweethearts.

00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:29.139
My mother and Wenlang's Omega
father Ying Yi are family friends.

00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.174
When I was young, I lived in Country P.

00:29:31.474 --> 00:29:33.209
Uncle Ying Yi took care of me the most.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.613
When he left, he asked me to
take good care of Wen Lang.

00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:39.782
When he left?

00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:41.016
Yeah.

00:29:42.886 --> 00:29:45.989
Uncle Ying Yi is the youngest
general in the Country P‘s military.

00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:47.723
His Alpha Shen Yu

00:29:47.724 --> 00:29:50.226
is the only heir to a famous
business family in Country P.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.061
Rumor has it that the two are married
only for political and business reasons,

00:29:52.062 --> 00:29:53.062
there's no emotions there.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.065
Ten years ago,

00:29:55.231 --> 00:29:57.551
The entire upper class of
country P was spreading the news.

00:29:58.168 --> 00:30:00.736
Uncle Ying Yi used special means.

00:30:00.737 --> 00:30:02.377
Only then did I get the permanent marker.

00:30:03.173 --> 00:30:04.808
Finally, due to political disagreements

00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:06.943
he died at the hands of his Alpha.

00:30:09.012 --> 00:30:10.612
It turned out to be a family misfortune.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.515
No wonder Shen Wenlang is a psychopath

00:30:13.018 --> 00:30:14.485
and that he hates Omegas so much.

00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:17.854
Because of Admiral Ying Yi.

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.135
Wenlang had a falling out with his family.

00:30:21.091 --> 00:30:24.193
He found me when he started his
business and asked me to help him.

00:30:25.862 --> 00:30:27.063
You are amazing.

00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:29.031
So...

00:30:29.341 --> 00:30:31.443
making my pheromone scent into shampoo

00:30:31.468 --> 00:30:34.204
shower gel and a toilet
cleaner was all your idea?

00:30:34.337 --> 00:30:35.337
Yeah.

00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:39.909
Mr. Sheng smells so good.

00:30:40.376 --> 00:30:41.845
I want the whole world to know.

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:49.419
Mr. Sheng.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.987
You are my catnip.

00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:52.455
My Poppy

00:30:53.823 --> 00:30:54.823
making me addicted.

00:30:57.127 --> 00:30:58.694
This is how Mr. Hua pursues people?

00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:01.096
Dirty means and lies.

00:31:01.097 --> 00:31:02.899
Paried with middling lovey-dovey words?

00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:04.566
Then I will change

00:31:04.834 --> 00:31:06.779
I will tell you whatever
Mr. Sheng wants to hear.

00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:08.071
I can learn.

00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:10.372
As long as I can stay with Mr. Sheng

00:31:10.373 --> 00:31:11.407
I can learn anything.

00:31:13.743 --> 00:31:15.011
Can you learn anything?

00:31:15.812 --> 00:31:16.812
Mr. Hua.

00:31:17.247 --> 00:31:21.351
Being my secretary is different
from being the master of X Holdings.

00:31:22.552 --> 00:31:24.854
As a secretary, you have to listen to me

00:31:25.998 --> 00:31:27.065
I'll ask you go east

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.258
and you can't go west.

00:31:28.424 --> 00:31:29.424
OK.

00:31:29.526 --> 00:31:31.394
I'm very good at listening to Mr. Sheng.

00:31:31.528 --> 00:31:33.408
I will always stay by
your side to protect you.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.231
I need your protection?

00:31:36.566 --> 00:31:37.634
No

00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:39.102
I'm too weak.

00:31:39.402 --> 00:31:41.002
It's me who need Mr. Sheng's protection.

00:31:43.506 --> 00:31:44.674
I'm going to dry my hair.

00:31:53.249 --> 00:31:54.249
Mr. Sheng.

00:31:55.418 --> 00:31:56.686
I have no friends.

00:31:57.253 --> 00:31:58.454
No family either.

00:32:01.057 --> 00:32:02.125
All I have is you.

00:32:03.726 --> 00:32:05.195
You have to protect me well.

00:32:05.695 --> 00:32:07.297
Mr. Hua has no friends.

00:32:08.097 --> 00:32:09.866
What about Shen Wenlang and Chang Yu?

00:32:11.835 --> 00:32:13.937
They're just people I find benefits with.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.806
It's more like an
alliance than a friendship.

00:32:19.075 --> 00:32:20.075
Mr. Sheng.

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:24.047
I only have you.

00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.589
Can I kiss you?

00:32:33.223 --> 00:32:34.223
No.

00:32:52.008 --> 00:32:55.912
Going through labour independently
without soothing pheromones

00:32:56.145 --> 00:33:00.350
especially for those with pheromone
disorders will be very difficult.

00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:03.953
If there is no Alpha

00:33:04.387 --> 00:33:07.090
your entire pregnancy
will be very difficult.

00:33:07.257 --> 00:33:08.523
You have to take this seriously.

00:33:08.524 --> 00:33:11.226
I suggest you terminate
the pregnancy immediately.

00:33:11.227 --> 00:33:12.462
Give up this child.

00:33:15.565 --> 00:33:16.565
Doctor.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.903
Is there no other way?

00:33:24.107 --> 00:33:25.107
I heard

00:33:25.174 --> 00:33:28.411
there are artificial soothing pheromones.

00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:33.215
Or I can try to use the pheromones of other
Alphas with higher matching degree to...

00:33:33.216 --> 00:33:33.950
No.

00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:36.486
Artificial pheromones
have limited effectiveness.

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:39.422
As for the pheromones of other Alphas.

00:33:39.856 --> 00:33:41.658
Mr. Gao, are you sure?

00:33:42.292 --> 00:33:44.661
This would be a huge moral hazard.

00:33:45.028 --> 00:33:46.261
Pregnancy and childbirth

00:33:46.262 --> 00:33:47.463
are your private matter.

00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:51.434
There are some things
that doctors shouldn't say.

00:33:52.035 --> 00:33:53.503
But I really can't bear to see this.

00:33:53.836 --> 00:33:54.871
Be honest.

00:33:55.672 --> 00:33:57.407
The Alpha who made you pregnant

00:33:57.974 --> 00:33:59.342
is such a scumbag.

00:34:00.643 --> 00:34:01.643
He is not.

00:34:03.172 --> 00:34:04.722
It's my own fault.

00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:07.250
What's your problem?

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:10.037
Take a good look at this record yourself.

00:34:10.653 --> 00:34:11.821
Your Alpha

00:34:12.188 --> 00:34:14.748
let you use inhibitors beyond
the specification for a long time.

00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:16.391
He has a problem.

00:34:16.392 --> 00:34:18.594
And there is obvious
disgust towards Omegas.

00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:22.431
Doctor.

00:34:27.003 --> 00:34:28.504
It's not him.

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:31.273
The inhibitor is my own fault.

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:33.042
Even if it's your own fault.

00:34:33.309 --> 00:34:34.210
What about pregnancy?

00:34:34.211 --> 00:34:37.413
Pregnancy can't be something done alone.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.050
Saying he hates it but still
gets other people pregnant.

00:34:41.484 --> 00:34:42.618
Such a scumbag.

00:34:42.952 --> 00:34:44.554
Shouldn't he take some responsibility?

00:34:47.724 --> 00:34:48.724
Doctor.

00:34:49.726 --> 00:34:51.527
I know you're doing this for me.

00:34:52.462 --> 00:34:54.330
But I really want this baby.

00:34:55.832 --> 00:34:57.734
Is there really no other way?

00:34:57.967 --> 00:35:00.336
Patients with sex hormone disorders

00:35:00.703 --> 00:35:03.706
are more difficult
than a normal Omega.

00:35:03.707 --> 00:35:05.341
You have a deep understanding of this.

00:35:05.975 --> 00:35:07.577
Your early pregnancy reactions

00:35:07.744 --> 00:35:10.212
are more serious than most Omegas.

00:35:10.213 --> 00:35:13.149
Without pheromone soothing.

00:35:13.249 --> 00:35:15.585
it'll be hard to go
through pregnancy alone.

00:35:15.785 --> 00:35:16.785
In addition,

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:20.223
you can no longer use
any inhibitor products.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.290
Doctor.

00:35:23.326 --> 00:35:24.860
I didn't continue using

00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:26.562
the injectable or oral inhibitors.

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:31.934
But for work there's also
short-term use of non-toxic sprays.

00:35:32.502 --> 00:35:34.170
Will this affect the baby?

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.606
The side effects of this spray

00:35:36.672 --> 00:35:37.774
is a lot smaller indeed.

00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:39.976
But given your situation

00:35:40.209 --> 00:35:42.812
I still suggest you stop
using it immediately.

00:35:56.659 --> 00:35:57.659
Come in.

00:36:05.968 --> 00:36:07.136
What happened to Mr. Shen?

00:36:07.303 --> 00:36:08.781
What happened to the secretarial team?

00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:11.339
It's OK if there's something wrong with the way
documents are organized in the morning meeting.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.209
But why is it so hard to even make tea?

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:14.944
Sorry Mr. Shen.

00:36:15.044 --> 00:36:15.912
This Da Hong Pao

00:36:15.913 --> 00:36:18.593
I made it according to the instruction
manual left by Secretary Gao.

00:36:18.714 --> 00:36:20.583
Maybe I haven't fully mastered it yet.

00:36:21.017 --> 00:36:24.229
However, Secretary Gao has been working
overtime these days to coordinate the work.

00:36:24.253 --> 00:36:25.253
He is still downstairs.

00:36:25.254 --> 00:36:26.856
Maybe I should invite him up?

00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:27.889
Not necessary.

00:36:28.024 --> 00:36:28.858
Without him.

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:30.193
You can't even make tea.

00:36:30.726 --> 00:36:32.195
So why do I hire you guys?

00:36:32.528 --> 00:36:33.329
Sorry

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.664
I'll go make another batch right away.

00:36:35.364 --> 00:36:36.364
Wait.

00:36:37.157 --> 00:36:39.259
How is the job handover going for Gao Tu?

00:36:39.435 --> 00:36:42.003
Secretary Gao said there was an emergency
at home these days.

00:36:42.004 --> 00:36:43.482
It is really hard for
him to get distance.

00:36:43.506 --> 00:36:45.173
We are also speeding
up the handover of work.

00:36:45.174 --> 00:36:46.876
It should be finished in a few days.

00:36:47.243 --> 00:36:48.811
He is in such a hurry to leave.

00:36:48.978 --> 00:36:50.513
There are so many things to hand over.

00:36:51.047 --> 00:36:53.087
I heard that he had
gastroenteritis a few days ago.

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:54.149
Vomiting easily.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.686
Can the handover be
done well in this state?

00:36:57.687 --> 00:36:58.955
You all keep a close eye on me.

00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:00.155
Don't make any mistakes.

00:37:02.892 --> 00:37:03.793
If it really doesn't work out,

00:37:03.794 --> 00:37:05.861
just ask him to take a break
before coming back to handle the handover.

00:37:05.862 --> 00:37:07.363
Okay, I'll pay attention to him.

00:37:07.497 --> 00:37:08.531
But don't worry.

00:37:08.631 --> 00:37:10.233
Secretary Gao is also very careful.

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.300
We were still discussing it during the day.

00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:14.469
He compiled a list of
your likes and dislikes

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.681
and submitted to the Secretariat.

00:37:15.705 --> 00:37:18.174
Even your backup medicine
is clearly written down.

00:37:18.207 --> 00:37:20.376
Secretary Gao really cares about you.

00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:23.311
Although he had to leave
because of family matters.

00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:26.048
But it also shows that he values you.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.650
Really?

00:37:31.687 --> 00:37:33.289
The Secretariat gets off work at 5:30.

00:37:33.588 --> 00:37:35.900
Gao Tu usually works overtime
for one hour on his own initiative.

00:37:35.925 --> 00:37:38.927
If you take the elevator then,
you're likely to run into him.

00:37:39.128 --> 00:37:40.929
Even if we don't happen
to meet in the elevator.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.666
I can just wait in the lobby for
ten minutes and we'd also meet.

00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:49.939
Gao Tu has handled a
lot of things over the years.

00:37:50.339 --> 00:37:52.909
I'm worried, so I'll
go check it out myself.

00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:54.309
You can rest assured

00:37:55.311 --> 00:37:56.512
I'll hand it over.

00:37:59.048 --> 00:38:00.048
Mr. Shen.

00:38:01.284 --> 00:38:02.961
All confidential documents
that need to be transferred

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.786
were finished as soon as possible.

00:38:04.787 --> 00:38:06.355
And the section about your privacy

00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:08.309
including but not limited to home passwords

00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:11.527
receiving documents via personal mailbox,

00:38:12.261 --> 00:38:14.630
I will also hand over to the
new assistant and secretary.

00:38:16.065 --> 00:38:17.300
If you are still worried,

00:38:18.768 --> 00:38:20.808
I can sign an additional
confidentiality agreement.

00:38:21.604 --> 00:38:23.739
A lifelong contract.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.007
That's not what I meant.

00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:26.007
Mr. Shen.

00:38:27.243 --> 00:38:28.511
I came here to tell you.

00:38:29.445 --> 00:38:32.248
I have deleted all the
access cards for the lounge.

00:38:33.015 --> 00:38:34.517
I will also forward the

00:38:34.717 --> 00:38:36.118
password reset process to Mia.

00:38:37.286 --> 00:38:38.387
If there's nothing else,

00:38:39.488 --> 00:38:40.523
I'll head out now.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.190
Wait.

00:38:49.899 --> 00:38:50.899
Mr. Shen.

00:38:52.902 --> 00:38:53.970
Do you have anything else?

00:38:55.504 --> 00:38:56.504
Umm.

00:38:56.539 --> 00:38:57.607
Is Qing feeling better?

00:39:02.778 --> 00:39:03.778
Mr. Shen.

00:39:05.748 --> 00:39:07.828
The money you paid for
my sister's medical expenses,

00:39:08.584 --> 00:39:10.344
I will return it to you
as soon as possible.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.620
I'm sorry.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.581
Maybe it won't be so fast...

00:39:14.857 --> 00:39:16.058
It will take some time.

00:39:16.425 --> 00:39:17.460
That's not what I meant.

00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:26.602
Thank you so much

00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.139
for such a long time.

00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:41.183
I will pay back what you lent to me.

00:40:09.345 --> 00:40:11.423
This is the information that
Mr. Sheng will use this afternoon.

00:40:11.447 --> 00:40:12.748
Please send it yourself.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:23.570
Mr. Sheng should be taking a lunch break
in the lounge at this time.

00:40:25.461 --> 00:40:26.595
Thank you, Secretary Chen.

00:40:27.263 --> 00:40:28.263
You're welcome.

00:40:30.933 --> 00:40:31.933
Mr. Hua.

00:40:35.338 --> 00:40:37.378
As soon as I graduated, I
joined SHENGFANG Biology.

00:40:37.606 --> 00:40:39.918
It's rare for Mr. Sheng to be
so serious in a relationship.

00:40:39.942 --> 00:40:41.310
If you are sincere,

00:40:41.744 --> 00:40:43.245
I hope you can give him a home.

00:40:43.579 --> 00:40:44.579
I will.

00:40:45.414 --> 00:40:47.950
I will give Mr. Sheng whatever he wants.

00:40:49.418 --> 00:40:50.453
Don't lie to him anymore.

00:40:51.287 --> 00:40:52.822
He hates being lied to the most.

00:40:53.055 --> 00:40:56.191
You're the first after having lied so much.

00:40:56.392 --> 00:40:57.392
Yeah.

00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:59.128
Mr. Sheng likes me so much.

00:40:59.462 --> 00:41:00.462
Yeah.

00:41:00.763 --> 00:41:02.365
Anyone with eyes can see it.

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:05.767
But if you lie again.

00:41:05.768 --> 00:41:07.036
He's going to hate you.

00:41:07.536 --> 00:41:10.171
In a previous relationship,
an Omega was twenty-five minutes late

00:41:10.172 --> 00:41:12.332
he lied and said that hhe
was in a minor car accident.

00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:14.777
Later, Mr. Sheng
investigated and found out.

00:41:15.177 --> 00:41:16.779
I sent him away immediately.

00:41:17.413 --> 00:41:18.847
There are many more examples like this.

00:41:18.848 --> 00:41:20.088
Do you want to hear a few more?

00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:21.216
No.

00:41:24.053 --> 00:41:25.454
I won't lie to him again.

00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:49.745
Why are you here?

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.020
I came to deliver some
documents to Mr. Sheng.

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:54.469
And keep him company in bed.

00:41:57.653 --> 00:41:59.822
There are seventeen
secretaries in this department.

00:42:00.189 --> 00:42:02.056
If every one of them

00:42:02.057 --> 00:42:04.459
climbed into my bed just to deliver a file,

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.462
My lounge would've been packed ages ago.

00:42:07.463 --> 00:42:08.764
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.700
With me here, no one else
can even get through the door.

00:42:12.234 --> 00:42:13.135
No one but me

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:14.670
gets to share your bed.

00:42:33.889 --> 00:42:36.292
By the way, I heard from Secretary Chen.

00:42:36.425 --> 00:42:38.585
You're due for a follow-up
on your pheromone disorder.

00:42:41.897 --> 00:42:43.732
But you smell totally fine to me.

00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:46.044
Doesn't seem like
you've got anything wrong.

00:42:46.068 --> 00:42:46.669
Not sure.

00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:48.471
It did flare up a few times before.

00:42:49.205 --> 00:42:51.085
I was supposed to go
for a check-up last month.

00:42:51.273 --> 00:42:52.474
But I didn't have the time.

00:42:58.981 --> 00:43:00.382
Then I'll go with you tomorrow.

00:43:03.052 --> 00:43:05.087
Even if I think it was just a misdiagnosis.

00:43:05.621 --> 00:43:09.658
This kind of condition does need
support from a partner for treatment.

00:43:11.393 --> 00:43:12.393
Partner?

00:43:13.262 --> 00:43:14.296
Did I say you were?

00:43:14.697 --> 00:43:16.332
Why so eager to claim that title?

00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:21.570
Mr. Sheng's in high demand.

00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:24.073
It took a lot of effort to get close.

00:43:25.007 --> 00:43:26.208
Of course I'm in a hurry.

00:43:32.748 --> 00:43:33.948
To put it simply

00:43:33.949 --> 00:43:34.984
I need to know

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.987
if you've been sexually
active with a partner lately.

00:43:38.554 --> 00:43:39.554
I...

00:43:41.824 --> 00:43:42.824
He has.

00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:46.507
Congratulations, Mr. Sheng.

00:43:46.929 --> 00:43:49.965
Your pheromone imbalance
has completely resolved

00:43:50.232 --> 00:43:51.232
I'd suggest

00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:52.767
that during future rut periods.

00:43:52.768 --> 00:43:55.671
You need to continue
staying with that same partner.

00:43:56.105 --> 00:43:57.105
What?

00:43:57.406 --> 00:43:59.774
Your compatibility with that Omega

00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:01.577
is likely over 90%.

00:44:01.844 --> 00:44:04.113
Their soothing pheromones
work especially well for you.

00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:07.742
Being intimate helps
stabilize your condition.

00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:17.293
You're telling my Alpha to
sleep with another Omega?
