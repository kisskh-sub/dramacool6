The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

-=Episode 12=-

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.350
You are here

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.840
Welcome

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.690
good

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.940
Hello

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.790
-Thank you. -Welcome back, uncle.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.640
Jaeyeon, you really look handsome.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.770
Hello, uncle

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.140
But what do you want for dinner?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.890
Cai Yun is not happy because he saw the uncle

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.690
Is it because of dinner?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.470
Auntie just said pick the one you want to eat the most and have a meal together

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.340
Really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.240
But what about Komatsu...

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.540
It seems he doesn't know where Xiaosong is.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.090
Are you Komatsu?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.940
Are you Komatsu?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.090
Uncle, uncle didn't recognize me.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.690
You are really beautiful.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.140
Oh, you've grown so big.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.870
Dr. Cui

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.730
yes

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.350
The lost lamb has returned

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.390
It's the lost old sheep.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.890
Welcome back

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620
I'll watch closely like a sheepdog.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.190
- Got it? - I'll keep it in mind.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.420
-Hello. -Hello.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.320
Oh, Father

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.220
I heard the medals won't be delivered until 7 o'clock.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.720
The event starts at 6 o'clock

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.020
What should I do if I arrive at 7 o'clock?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.820
That is to say

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.020
This is another test for us.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.590
I'm a little dizzy from all the preparations.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.690
Talk later

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.990
Patient Kim Sun-joo's pain seems to be getting worse

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.750
- I'll go see the doctor.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.620
I'll go see patient Kim Sun-joo.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.420
Just change the painkiller

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.720
Ye-na, go help the nuns prepare for the event.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.920
Ah, okay

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620
Sorry, I'll take my leave now.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.350
Um

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.950
I'm so happy that you're back safe and healthy.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.350
Greetings, I'll take my time after work tomorrow.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.590
Have a good meal with the kids

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.590
It turns out this isn't my welcome party.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.550
Uncle, let's go eat.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.420
Okay, what do you want to eat?

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.050
Auntie just gave me a card

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.440
Let's go eat something delicious

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.450
Let's eat beef

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.850
Walk, walk, walk

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.520
What do you want to eat?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.350
Slightly increased the dosage of painkillers

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.390
It's okay now

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.650
But it might be hard in the early morning

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.920
I have an event today and will be staying in the hospital until late.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.550
Tell me then

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.250
Thank you, doctor.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.050
doctor

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.750
No hormone therapy is done here

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.850
Maybe radiofrequency heat therapy or something like that?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.440
right

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.120
Not a penny charged

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.390
Still treating with such care

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.650
Stop saying weird things.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.050
Bone scan, CT, MRI, etc.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.090
If a spinal fracture is suspected

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.720
X-rays can be taken

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.630
Those are not needed

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.550
Previous radiation therapy

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.920
Heat therapy and so on.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.290
Not suitable at all

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.890
No effect

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.390
I'm here

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.520
The doctor puts me at ease.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.050
I think it's great

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.750
Very comfortable

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.420
You can be given medication to reduce your risk of fractures.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.750
In addition, I will

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.420
Prepare a physical therapy program for pain relief

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.920
Excuse me

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.420
Sorry, I set it to vibrate.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.200
I'll give it to you before the weekend

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.650
Sorry, doctor.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.620
She felt she couldn't afford the medical bills.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.690
That's why I was transferred to this hospital.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.170
That's why I feel so sad.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.950
Because of treatment costs

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.150
It seems that I also borrowed high-interest loans

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.690
It's okay. I completely understand your daughter's feelings.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.550
thank you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.650
-=Maria Welfare Hospital Patrons' Night=-

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.050
The Lord has said

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.150
Share what you have with others

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.650
It is love

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.990
Thanks to everyone's hard work

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.470
And generously donated

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.800
Past year

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.340
Our Maria Welfare Hospital

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.710
To save so many patients

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.940
Thank you again to all the sponsors and volunteers today

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.800
Let's applaud and cheer each other on, okay?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.170
OK, thanks

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.520
Mother

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.200
Mom, are you okay?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.050
So I said I need better treatment.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.830
Mother

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.750
I'll find a way to raise more money.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.240
Let's go back to the previous hospital to continue treatment.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.300
Thank you today too. Please accept this.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.800
-OK, thanks

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.670
- A little thought. - Thank you.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.870
Thank you for joining us as a sponsor this year.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.340
Although it's late, congratulations on becoming the dean.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.600
Thanks

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.870
You are so busy

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.640
I still come to participate every year

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.330
We also provide sponsorship

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.070
Thanks to you, I am also doing good deeds.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.370
You want to see it once a year and see it with your own eyes, right?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.340
I've had similar experiences, so I understand.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.500
After Daxian was imprisoned for drug abuse

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.340
I'm the same

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.840
Using the excuse of eating

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.650
Confirm the situation with your own eyes

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.700
Dr. Yu Suzhen went to see a doctor

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.270
Mr. Zhao Zhenghao of the attic

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.400
Died

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.240
After I left

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.440
He's been drinking again.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.040
Yes

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.000
There's nothing wrong with the autopsy report.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.670
but

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.420
Be careful when visiting patients

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.940
Dr. Yu Suzhen, if a suspicious death occurs around you

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.470
It's dangerous, you know.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.780
How does it feel to go around in a circle?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.640
Are you relieved?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.440
doctor

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.470
My mother's condition worsened.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.870
Young-eun's sister

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.770
Is that Ji-hoon?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.800
elder sister

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.600
Our Zhixun

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.240
Oh my, our Ji-hoon has grown up so much.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.800
Are you doing well?

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.020
Um

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.680
I heard

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.800
You became a police officer

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.670
Yes

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.740
Awesome. Well done.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.820
To be able to grow so well

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.850
You must have suffered a lot alone these years.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.700
It's really amazing

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.470
If uncles and aunts see

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.850
How happy I should be

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.840
yes

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.870
You were sickly as a child.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.140
When going out to play

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.400
She always lies on Yingen's back and is carried back.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.570
But you are growing up healthy now

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.900
It's a blessing

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.920
When I was a child,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.100
Thanks to my sister for taking care of me

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.770
-Yeah. -Thank you.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.770
Thank you for what?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.300
Aunt

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.240
I'm sorry

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.040
After sending you to the orphanage

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.980
I couldn't take good care of you.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.000
It's okay

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.340
After I went to the welfare home

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.650
You've come to see me several times.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.970
I only feel grateful

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.770
You are here

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.200
Please get me some bottles of Pavolon.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.800
Don't tell my husband.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.170
Ah, could it be...

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.670
Is it because of insomnia?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.000
If that's the case, then Barfron is too dangerous.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.100
Why don't you call me over?

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.900
- I'm not dangerous. - Damn it.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.940
There are experiments to be done.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.050
It's a business need. Please help me get it.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.200
OK

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.940
Please go back

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.940
What subjects should be chosen for the experiment?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.720
What to choose?

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.590
What to choose?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.270
What to choose?

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.520
Ah, hello

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.970
That's it

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.370
This brace supports the spine very comfortably

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.500
But pushing too hard could cause injury.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.840
Now the length is adjusted

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.450
Just move gently and comfortably.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.690
-Thank you. -Yes.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.870
but

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.870
Are you always alone in the ward?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.800
My daughter

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.290
I'm busy raising money and don't have time to come.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.020
She wants me to get better treatment.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.000
Do you want to go back to the previous hospital?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.940
I definitely don't want to go there

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.500
You don't know how much it hurts

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.150
It's clearly a life-saving treatment

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.740
I don't know why it hurts so much.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.100
It's torture.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.800
OK, I understand.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.100
You take a rest

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.250
OK

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.000
Thank you

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.440
The patient

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.420
Um

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.570
If convenient

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.340
Can you accompany me for a walk in the park in front?

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.430
What

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.770
no

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.640
Is there a park in front?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.770
Yes, the park in front

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.100
It's breathtakingly beautiful when the flowers bloom

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.720
But no flowers now

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.950
I would like to

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.740
But you are so busy

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.770
Do you have time?

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.200
That's why I ask you

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.370
The director of this hospital is my friend.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.270
But too mean and stingy

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.990
No time for me to rest

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.340
So I wanted to use the patient as an excuse to go to the park in front

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.120
Be lazy

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.200
Then I'm fine too.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.500
Are you off work now?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.580
Yes, I worked the night shift last night.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.300
Thanks for your hard work

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.670
- Take care. - Thank you.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.450
By the way, my aunt is not in the ward now.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.470
What happened?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.740
No, Dr. Choi Dae-hyun took her

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.500
Went for a walk in the park in front

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.870
Ah, okay

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.240
Doctor Cui seems to see that she is bored all day long.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.940
I took her out.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.300
I should have been the one accompanying you

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.500
Thank you

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.870
But Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.770
Is it the male doctor in the white coat?

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.340
Yes, that's him.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.100
Thank you. Go back soon.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.570
-Okay, bye. -Okay.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.370
-=Dr. Choi Dae-hyun=-

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.550
-=Dr. Choi Dae-hyun: Police Assisted in the Baflon Murder Case=-

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.720
-=Real names of key figures in the Bafron murder case revealed=-

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.870
-There are also reeds. -When the flowers bloom here

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.790
It's really beautiful

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.070
It would be nice to see it again.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.700
It's not uncomfortable now, right?

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.970
- Do you want to go back? - It's okay.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.770
-Are you okay? -It's okay.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.420
very nice

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.980
The pine trees are also very green

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.930
The director of this hospital

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.400
Still didn't accept my sincerity

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.800
good

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.430
-Okay. -Thank you.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.940
Your daughter came really early today

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.770
I wish you guys a good time then.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.310
Next time, please let me take a break.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.840
-Thank you. -It's okay.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.000
-Mom -Yeah

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.850
Don't follow that doctor out.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.980
I heard he killed someone.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.710
His targets are sick elderly patients

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.440
What are you talking about?

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.700
He's a good person.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.770
I heard he helps people with euthanasia.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.110
Because of this, he killed someone and was even imprisoned.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.230
I'm telling the truth

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.900
Do you want me to find the report and show it to you?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.000
And photos?

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.010
What

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.300
If you don't believe me, you can ask Zhixun.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.160
He's a policeman, he knows better than anyone else.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.260
oh

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.080
It seems that the hospital will be very noisy during this period because of me.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.970
How long can I keep it secret?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.440
I figured this was going to get out anyway.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.520
Be sure to tell the patient or guardian

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.720
Ask for their forgiveness

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.980
I think they'd be scared too.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.060
If it were me, I would be surprised too.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.440
I like it here

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.020
If I go to the same hospital again,

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.990
I might as well go home.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.230
What kind of treatment is that?

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.640
If I have to go to treatment, I won't go anywhere.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.430
I might as well just die here.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.640
If you want to leave, go on your own.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.310
I know you are afraid that I will owe more debts and you are worried about the money.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.400
So stop talking.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.670
If you keep doing this, I'll become shabby.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.750
I'm so incompetent at my age.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.730
No money to treat my mother

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.860
My life is so empty and sad

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.870
So stop doing this.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.810
Zhixun will drive to pick us up tomorrow morning

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.830
If you don't want to go to the previous hospital

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.790
I'll ask for a better hospital.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.810
Let's go to another hospital.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.740
Auntie might change hospitals

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.830
Finally made this decision

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.090
My sister asked me

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.170
Is it true that Choi Dae-hyun

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.350
Spent time in prison

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.180
Stand in your daughter's shoes

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.370
If I knew that doctors were connected to euthanasia

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.020
It must be hard for her to accept

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.150
But they're all excuses

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.190
My sister from the beginning

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.030
I want to be transferred to a hospital that can provide more treatment.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.630
And Choi Dae-hyun is just her excuse

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.760
Please help me with the discharge procedures tomorrow.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.410
good

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.960
I can go by myself

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.380
Aren't you going back to get your luggage?

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.850
Not much

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.540
You wait for me up ahead. I'll get ready myself.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.790
I'll go with you

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.410
I'll help you with your luggage

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.630
Thank you, Ji-hoon

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.270
Why doesn't it work?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.650
Just come in with shoes on.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.280
The floor is cold

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.600
If you stay here for too long, your feet will get so cold they hurt.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.830
I'll pack my luggage right away

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.100
What do you want to take?

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.680
- No need. - This one?

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.370
Are you surprised to see the conditions we live in?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.640
This house doesn't feel like a home, it feels more like a warehouse

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.920
Have you been staying in the hospital?

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.230
The luggage is constantly decreasing. I don't live here much.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.500
Almost all of them live in the hospital

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.670
How did my uncle die?

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.240
Cerebral hemorrhage

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.760
He suddenly fainted and passed away without saying a word.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.510
So we didn't receive a penny of the money we were supposed to receive.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.880
So many people came to ask for the money they owed

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.120
Then the restaurant closed

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.930
Later my mother cleaned the building

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.630
I don't pick jobs. I do everything.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.690
In this case, even my aunt got sick.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.700
It must be very hard for you to be alone

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.610
Nothing hard

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.000
I couldn't do anything for my mother.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.190
This makes me feel sorry

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.390
so

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.990
I will do everything I can to get my mother treatment.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.510
My mother is so pitiful

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.590
I want her to live at least one more day.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.510
What

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.760
What's this

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.580
You just sit down

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.960
Doctor, thank you for this time.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.900
I'm really happy here

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.620
We didn't do anything for you.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:07.210
You've all been very nice to me.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.860
No need to accept the painful treatment that I have suffered enough

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.290
This makes me very happy

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.570
Is treatment painful?

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.450
Yes, the thought of using oneself to walk into

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.210
That boring place is painful enough.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.110
But after all, that's what the child wants.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.300
I still have to go

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.740
Do you want to talk to your daughter?

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.370
Although it is not appropriate to say such words in front of the Virgin Mary

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.000
But I want to decide for myself

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.520
My last journey, okay?

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.570
mom

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.950
mom

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.420
-=Yu Suzhen=-

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.820
What's the matter?

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.700
Kim Sun-joo disappeared in the hospital

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.380
Hey, brother

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.620
The road surveillance near Xizhen East Convenience Store captured

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.470
Old lady in hospital gown

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.810
Looks like Kim Sun Joo

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.540
It's still dark now. We have to wait a long time for the bus to come.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.520
Come with me

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.030
I don't want to go there

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.670
What will happen if I go?

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.070
Sister is waiting for you

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.340
I have no confidence

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.970
Go there again to receive painful treatment

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.830
Zhixun

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.490
Auntie has a wish

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.500
Give me

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.490
Yingen

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.170
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:32.920
mom

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.190
Trust me again

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.260
I will make sure you get treatment and live longer.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.140
What I can do

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.210
I'm not refusing treatment because I don't trust you.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.880
Otherwise why

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.450
The debt you owe now

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.230
Even if I can't finish it in my lifetime

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.900
Then I can't abandon you.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.950
How can not accepting treatment be considered abandoning me?

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:28.930
What is this thing?

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.030
Do you want to wait for me to die and die with me?

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.050
Now in debt to pay medical bills

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.180
When I die, do you want to die with me?

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.390
mom

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.680
us…

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.310
We have to live together

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.870
Let's die together.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.370
I can't live without you

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.770
I don't want to live anymore

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.750
Yingen

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.750
Let me go now

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.030
mom

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.280
I won't send you away

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.280
I can't just send you away like this.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.130
I'm in so much pain

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.760
It hurts so much now

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.420
It will definitely hurt more later

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.600
I'm so scared

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.930
Even at this age, I'm still afraid.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.630
So scared

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.880
What kind of treatment is this?

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.100
That will give you cancer.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.160
I'd rather die.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.180
I didn't know you were in so much pain, mom.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.780
I didn't know you were so scared

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.910
Sorry, Mom

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.880
But I now

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.660
I don't want to receive treatment anymore

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.630
I just want to die

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.210
Enjoy looking at my daughter's face

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.180
yes

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.960
Before

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.930
We're both busy making money.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.680
I couldn't even look at the other person's face properly.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.780
Yes or no

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:06.960
yes

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.260
You know me before

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.910
Undergoing such painful treatment

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.010
How did you manage to hold on?

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.810
After treatment

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.280
night

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.230
Our daughter will come to see me

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.980
I want to see your face

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.930
so

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.560
So I can stick to it

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.860
I now

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.610
I want to take a good look at my daughter's face

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.110
Then die

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.030
I don't want to anymore

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.330
Taking that treatment again

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.960
Don't want to

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.710
Mother

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.010
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.560
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.660
Mother

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.010
Sorry, doctor.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.180
I changed my mind.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.960
I want my mother

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.830
Stayed in this hospital

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.680
Thank you for trusting us and letting her be treated here.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.510
that...

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.860
I jumped to conclusions and said bad things about you.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.380
sorry

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.760
No, I should have explained my situation to you in advance.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.710
sorry

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.860
Thank you for helping me find my mother.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.510
Won't

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.630
Well done, sister.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.080
Let's meet here more often

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.410
Please give your aunt a good ride.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.210
OK

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.460
Mother

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.930
- What? - Do you want to contact the aunts?

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.930
What

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.880
The last place you worked

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.010
Aren't you close friends with the aunties who clean the building?

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.460
Sometimes he'll call me.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.960
If you can, that's fine.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.080
I want to see them too.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.430
Then I'll contact you.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.510
Mother

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.810
Um

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.880
Tell me if you have anything you want to do

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.430
If you want to eat something, just tell me

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.260
I want to do these things for you

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.360
What's delicious?

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.780
Go to the park in front

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.960
Taking a walk

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.610
Let's chat more

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.780
Let's just live like this

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.280
We do everything we want to do with a smile

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.560
good

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.060
It's great here.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.860
-Yeah. -It's great.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.160
- When did you come? - Spring

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.480
- At that time? - Yeah

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.230
How nice it would be to come when it blooms

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.080
- There. - Yeah.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.560
- There are a lot of reeds there. - Really?

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.910
- So happy. - Are you happy?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.030
I'm very happy to be with you

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.760
I am also very happy with my mother

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.730
OK

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.910
good

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.810
It's great that everyone is so healthy.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.710
-Yeah. -That's right.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.210
I miss you so much, sister.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.080
Is Captain Jin also fond of finding faults recently?

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.680
-She shows off her grandson every day. -He's so big now.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.160
-She did it on purpose. -She's so beautiful.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.230
So cute

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.180
This is the degree of pain

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.560
From 1 to 10

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.530
Make an annotation

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.460
Please tell me how many hours apart

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.560
What level of pain will occur

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.780
No, it's always changing

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.230
When my heart is very determined

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.660
About 5

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.660
When it rains

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.680
Or when you're worried

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.630
There are 10

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.060
but

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.360
Recently

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.430
It's all in this state

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.830
You must be feeling very uncomfortable

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.860
But enduring like this is truly remarkable.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.330
Thanks

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.980
Always changing

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.530
When my heart is very determined

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.610
About 5

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.710
What

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.010
Did you say anything?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.760
Hey

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.960
Where is this...

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.390
She's so old.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.870
Maybe I just suddenly forgot.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.370
She has a bad cervical spine. I only care about this.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.740
The earlier you discover

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.270
There are more ways to stop the deterioration

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.970
Let’s pay more attention.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.370
good

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.140
Thanks to you, she has been sleeping well recently.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:16.840
Your mother

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.120
Did you sleep longer?

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.140
Yes

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.670
The pain seems to have eased a lot

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.690
My body seems to have recovered a little

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.740
I can walk better than before

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.490
Hurry up, kids, we have to go over there.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.670
sorry

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.020
Mother

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.890
Mother

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.820
Mother

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.770
In cognitive screening exams

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.490
Abnormal symptoms have occurred

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.570
Although imaging examinations are still needed

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.540
Looking for a clearer reason

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.570
But I'm sure there's cognitive impairment.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.470
Suddenly I can't recognize anyone.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.870
No matter what, it's Alzheimer's

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.690
It's going much faster than expected.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.790
She had been taking various medications

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.420
There must be something that makes the condition worsen faster.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:14.990
Are you okay?

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.890
oh

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:17.190
Zhixun

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.920
Zhixun

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.790
Help Auntie

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.240
Didn't you promise me then?

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.620
Help me euthanize

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.240
What did you say?

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:30.690
What euthanasia?

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.240
Please talk to the doctor here for me.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.340
Let them kill me

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.190
It's not easy to adjust the proportions properly.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.770
It's harder than I thought to let someone pass away without pain.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.420
Is that why my brother is so obsessed with that woman?

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.840
Did you agree to euthanize the patient?

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.490
I don't

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.640
Did she ask you for help?

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.470
Yes

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.170
That night

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.340
Auntie has a wish

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.020
Let me

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.790
Perform euthanasia

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.270
What do you mean?

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.620
Dr. Cui from Maria Hospital

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.240
It's not about euthanasia.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.570
Was he just arrested?

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.790
He knows how to do it, right?

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:49.690
that

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.790
I want to die like this

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.190
So please ask him for my help.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.420
That's murder. It's a crime.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.670
Just consider it as helping me

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:05.320
Please help me just this once, Ji-hoon.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.720
OK

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.370
I am in so much pain

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.470
I don't want to live anymore

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.990
If I knew what my aunt thought,

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.170
What about my sister?

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.540
What should I do with my sister?

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.220
-Young-eun.. -For my sister

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.420
You have to cheer up too.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.140
We Yingen

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.840
In debt

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.920
I thought that after I died, I would die too.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.740
I want to die without telling Young-eun

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.870
Let her not feel guilty

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.740
I can't say this to my sister.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.120
I will tell my sister

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.820
Don't over-treat

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.890
Please give up this idea.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.540
I'll pretend I haven't heard of it.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.120
Auntie wants euthanasia

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:06.870
But why didn't you tell me

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.820
I didn't mean to help her.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.090
And I think after she came here

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.990
Maybe changed my mind

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.280
but

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.040
After the onset of dementia, I started saying this.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.460
You will quickly lose your memory

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:26.520
Shouldn't

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.370
Do you want to euthanize her?

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.240
don’t worry

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.940
I definitely won't help her.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.410
Please organize your respective responsibilities and send them to me.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.150
good

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.660
What's wrong

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.640
Ouch, why are you looking at me like that?

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.090
nothing

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.800
I just like looking at you

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.740
I like it so much, I want to see more

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.650
Um

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:14.450
Mother

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.360
I will remember it

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:25.970
Remember how much my mother loves me

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.000
What a good person

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.740
Did mom really ask you to do this?

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.980
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.550
Let's help her do it.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.390
Don't you think they look like Lee Yoon Hee and Xiao Song?

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.460
That's what I thought when I first saw it.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.290
If Lee Yoon Hee hadn't died, she would have continued to raise Xiao Song.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.820
I should live like them.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.440
You can't solve all the pain in the world.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.230
They are mother and daughter

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.050
I've never done what I wanted to do in my life.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:45.870
Always busy with work

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.720
I never used the money I earned well.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.260
Mom got sick

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.880
My daughter can only take care of me

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.420
At least let her go last.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.990
Be more comfortable

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.320
You suffered so much because of euthanasia.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.210
So absolutely not

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.970
I've been thinking a lot during this time.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.150
About what I did

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.390
and its weight

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:24.540
There must be

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.750
Patients requiring euthanasia

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.170
I will look for pain relief treatment again.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.220
Euthanasia is not the only answer

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:35.440
I know

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.730
Young-eun will be alone soon, even for her.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.080
Please think about it again.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.080
Sending my mother away in pain

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.530
It might make her more miserable.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.920
There is no way to confirm the patient's wishes now.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.530
So absolutely no euthanasia.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.760
But the pain...

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.430
This hospital is run to save lives.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.640
so

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.640
If you want to say something like that, don't come here starting tomorrow.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:46.370
-=Silence in the room=-

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.100
I'm going to the general hospital today.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.580
Blood tests and MRIs

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.090
Even if I want to deny it

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.080
The results will be out today.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:08.410
I couldn't raise the medical expenses in time.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.840
So I missed several surgeries.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.290
If you receive treatment promptly

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.610
It should be very different from the current situation

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.310
I know you tried your best

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.270
We have only suffered

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.160
Only felt the pain

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:41.780
Dr. Yu

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.740
Help us

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.790
That's right

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.910
I now

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.560
I'm asking you to perform euthanasia.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.950
We don't do that kind of treatment.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.140
besides

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.090
Patients whose will cannot be confirmed

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.070
Euthanasia is unacceptable anywhere.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.040
So you have to live in that kind of pain.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:32.190
I will look for pain relief treatment.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:35.150
Dr. Yu

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.790
Please help my mother

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.920
I'm sincere

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.570
Please don't ignore my mother.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.520
Dr. Yu

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.530
Help us

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.280
Please help us

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.280
How are you doing?

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.130
That's right

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.780
I'm going straight to the point.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.060
The mixing ratio is harder than I thought.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.540
Have you practiced?

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.730
No, Bafron can make people die painlessly.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.960
This is all lies. This is all fake.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:43.240
If the ratio is not right, it will be very painful when you die.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.260
Who did you test it on?

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.190
Don't worry, I didn't use it on anyone.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.520
So you just work with me.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:58.190
I am different from my brother. I can really scale up.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.080
Don't appear in front of me again

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.510
I will never do what you want

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.380
What a shame. I will definitely do it.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.220
If you don't help me, there's nothing I can do.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.430
The client will die in pain

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:22.190
That's right

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.190
besides

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.510
This is a gift

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.370
I'll give you a chance, think about it carefully.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.270
I have to go home quickly

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.380
My Yingen must be waiting for me

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.390
Go home

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.800
I have to go home quickly.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.840
Yingen is scared when she is alone at home

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:25.580
-=Ward A=-

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.060
DOA

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.110
-=Emergency Ward=-

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.080
Died upon arrival

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.530
Yingen

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.460
-=University Hospital=-

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.770
-=Severely ill emergency patients=-

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:21.840
Dr. Yu

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.300
Are you feeling unwell?

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.520
Um, why didn't I see my Yingen?

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.560
You don't know where my Yingen is, right?

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:38.870
Sorry, I didn't see it.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:47.060
No, my memory is sometimes confused.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.140
but

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.020
But occasionally

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.810
I dream that my Yingen was hit by a car

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.470
My dream is too real

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.820
I wake up crying when I sleep

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.560
Is my Yingen okay?

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.450
She should be fine.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.470
Because I can't see the children,

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.770
I feel very uneasy

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:29.040
Doctor, please help me find Ying'en.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.470
Could it be

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:43.980
That's not a dream

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.660
no

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.080
Our Yingen

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:49.690
Was there an accident?

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:51.130
Are you injured?

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:53.000
Was it injured?

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.050
Isn't he in the hospital now?

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.570
Where

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:58.010
ah

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.680
sorry

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:06.270
Our Yingen

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.570
Is there something unexpected?

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.810
ah

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.160
what to do

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:16.930
what to do

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.640
What should I do? My daughter

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.850
Where is she

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.140
No

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.090
Not my child

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.560
Where is she

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.530
What should I do? It's so pitiful.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.850
What should I do? My daughter

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.480
Oh, what should I do?

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.450
Let me go

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.530
I want to go too.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.200
Please let me go with her.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.330
Please send me to my daughter.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.990
Why am I still alive?

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.850
Just to see her.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.140
I can't survive this.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.530
Let me go

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:50.510
Please

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.990
Send me to my daughter.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:56.900
Send me to my daughter.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.210
I can't survive this.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.480
When my memory briefly returned yesterday

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.090
She realized that Ying'en was no longer alive.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.290
Although I lost my memory soon after

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.990
After losing her daughter, she no longer wanted to live.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.200
She wanted me to arrange euthanasia for her.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.300
My sister also asked me the same thing.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.510
At that time I thought

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:29.670
Just a momentary emotion

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.130
But it seems not

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:35.720
I want to ask you

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.230
Take good care of my mother

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.870
you

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.210
Talk to that doctor.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.350
Let Mom

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:52.150
peacefully

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.650
Leave

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:57.740
Because of my greed

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:00.600
Mom in pain

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.000
One received treatment without any effect

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.100
She will know nothing in the future

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.950
Memories will also be forgotten

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:17.450
I can't let her die in pain.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:19.790
sister

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:21.820
Please

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.250
Please help my mother.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.470
So far, for whatever reason

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:49.290
I thought I could never give up on life.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.030
But now I don’t understand

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:55.590
only

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.220
I hope Auntie can

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.060
A little calmer

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.400
I'll come back after get off work.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.230
At that time we looked at each other and talked

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.400
It seems like I've encountered some difficulties.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:01.950
That grandma is really pitiful.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:03.770
It seems like dementia

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.840
You didn't even know your own daughter was dead, right?

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.330
-Who are you? -Me?

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.370
I am my brother's sister

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.330
Gu Guangzhe

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.230
You are very familiar with my brother, right?

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.540
Come work with me again.

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:28.220
Before that, I want to see your strength.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.160
So I have a suggestion for you

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.160
No, I won't agree to any suggestion.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.410
that is

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.550
Help me kill my husband.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.800
Is your husband seriously ill?

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.890
No, his problem is that he is too healthy.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.830
Because of excess energy, I always do useless things

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.130
Does it look like Lee Yoon Hee and Komatsu?

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:07.450
Let me die

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.930
Mom is sick

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.190
My mom

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:11.420
It's always been hard

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.570
My daughter has been taking care of me.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.350
She has been suffering

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.930
Don't ignore my mom.

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.950
Please help my mom.

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:23.040
I

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:25.040
The last journey of life

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.360
Can't

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:30.610
Is it up to me to decide?

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:32.530
At least the last journey of life

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:34.410
It's time to leave peacefully, isn't it?

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:35.810
I hope Auntie can

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:37.770
A little more peaceful

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:39.600
Do you need that more?

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.010
Able to properly arrange the last journey of life

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.600
Make people peaceful

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.210
What about the medical skills that left?

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.100
Please send me to my daughter.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.460
Why am I still alive?

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.540
Just to see her.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:00.810
I can't survive this.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.130
Let me go

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.250
Definitely

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.650
Patients requiring euthanasia

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.750
So to kill healthy people

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.980
Do you want me to euthanize him?

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:44.720
Is that not okay?

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.690
It seems you have never killed a healthy person.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:14.090
-=Treatment Room=-

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:27.870
Yu Suzhen

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.970
Please help me

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:16.320
-=Thank you for watching Death Doctor Mary=-
