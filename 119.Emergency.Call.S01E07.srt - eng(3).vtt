It's because I wanted to assuage her guilt, even just a little.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.450
Sure, she may have impulsively hurt her sister.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.360
But that girl called with the intent to save her.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.560
She should be made aware of that.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.720
It's better than assuming you were powerless in the situation.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.990
Now, whether her younger sister actually forgives her is a different story, though.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.210
I'm sure they'll be okay.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.910
I have an elder sister myself, so I understand.

I feel there are plenty of things I can do

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.650
and challenges I haven't tried yet in this work.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.280
Such as qualifying as a paramedic?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.410
Yes. I thought I'd start there.

I've always had high aspirations.

I see.

So why were you looking at medical books?

I suppose it was getting old.

Your next one should be a gas stove.

Yes, I suppose enough time has passed by now.

From what?

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.300
- That fire. You still remember it, right?
- I do.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.480
You and Konatsu were both young when it happened,

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.990
so we assumed any flame would remind you of it.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.360
That's why we avoided things that visibly used fire.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.130
Which is also why we never had candles for your birthdays.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.150
So that's why.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.960
I suppose we parents were being a bit too cautious.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.240
Come to think of it, you two never pressed us about the fire either.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.810
Next thing we knew, you were saying you wanted to be a dispatcher.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.300
I suppose life always has its surprises.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:16:02.180
It seems we were quick to assume that fire scared you.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.410
You're right. I guess it wasn't just a scary memory for me.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.060
But to Onee-chan...

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.280
maybe that's all it was.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.610
What?

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.120
I think Onee-chan's aphonia was triggered

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.250
because I made her recall that fire.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.050
[Aphonia]

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.960
Actually, she stopped speaking

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.140
only after I said I wanted to become a dispatcher.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.070
Doesn't that mean...

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.540
it was... all my fault?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.140
That's probably why she's avoiding me, too.

No, that's not...

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.960
For now, how about we eat?

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.010

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.720
[I didn't realize there was so much greenery in Yokohama.]

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.980
Right?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.510
And I'm sure your illustrations will make my article all the more appealing.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.830
I'm going to head back to the office. What about you?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.970
[I'm going to walk a bit farther along.]

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.920
Got it.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.560
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.240
More like a rescue than a medical emergency.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.730
What seems to be the matter?

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.240
I was installing all-terrain tires for winter

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.470
when the jack collapsed.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.890
My leg is stuck under my car.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.900
And it's still stuck, yes?

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.790
- Yes.
- Understood.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.660
Please tell us where to send the ambulance.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.680
[Receive call]

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.160
Kaneshita from Yokohama Fire Bureau Command speaking.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.200
This is Mukai from 110 requesting a search and rescue.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.490
An 11-year-old boy has been reported missing by his father

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.650
in Sasanodai Forest, Isogo Ward.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.510
Search for an 11-year-old boy. Copy that.
[Lost? 11, male]

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.530
Where is the father currently?

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.180
He called from Hinode Park, also located in Sasanodai Forest.
[Exclusive use]

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.840
"Hinode Park." Understood.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.750
We'll send a rescue squad right away.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.250
It's all forest around there.
[Sasanodai Forest Area]

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.310
I hope he didn't wander far.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.560
Could we get further details?

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.950
Yes. The missing boy is named Sakurai Ryota-kun, who is 11 years old.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.020
He was hiking with his parents, but after arguing with his mother,
[Sakurai Ryota]

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.000
he wandered ahead of both his parents on the hiking trail.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.750
When the parents arrived at Hinode Park, he couldn't be found.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.930
They searched the area for an hour to no avail.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.030
- Have you asked them what Ryota-kun wore today?
- Yes.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.470
He was wearing a brown jacket, navy pants, and an orange backpack.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.490
- Copy that.
- We've told the family you may need to hear from them.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.440
May I give you their number?
[Backpack, Orange]

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.640
Please do.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.570
- This is Yokohama Fire Bureau.
- This is Captain Iida of Central Rescue Squad.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.330
We've searched within an 800-meter radius around Hinode Park

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.350
but haven't found the boy.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.100
Requesting back-up to aid with the search.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.080
We'll send in another firefighting team and a paramedic team.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.370
We have only an hour until sunset.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.410
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.120
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:10.150
Are you perhaps unable to speak now?

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.070
If yes, please tap the phone once.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.680
You can't speak. Understood.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.840
In that case...

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.140
[Phone number: 090-332-414]

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.410
What?

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.500
I've even memorized your number
[Kasuhara Konatsu: 090-332-414]

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.240
so I'll know it's you at any time.
[Phone number: 090-332-414]

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.240
Onee-chan, is that you?

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.920
If yes, then please tap the phone once.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.460
Onee-chan...

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.180
This is no time to be surprised.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.870
If it's a fire, tap the phone once. Three times if it's a medical emergency.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.300
She needs an ambulance...

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.540
I'm going to ask you several questions now.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.320
Tap once for yes, okay?

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.710
Are you the one who needs an ambulance?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.840
It's someone else?

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.510
Is this person conscious?

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.740
Are they breathing?

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.040
So they're breathing and conscious.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.410
Are they hurt?

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.760
Are they bleeding?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.280
They're not bleeding?

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.110
Which means it's possibly a sprain or broken bone.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.720
Now, I'll ask about where you are.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.750
Onee-chan, are you around Mt. Okamine?

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.500
Were you in the middle of a hike?

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.830
Okay.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.010
Do you know where you are along the trail?

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.640
She has her location turned off.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.070
She doesn't know.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.200
Kasuhara, send her a link to "Video 119."

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.890
That'll turn her GPS on, and we'll get more information from a video.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.120
Yes, Sir.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.750
Onee-chan, I'm going to send you a URL.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.180
Accessing it will connect us to your phone's camera.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.670
If that works for you, could I get a response?

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.490
I just sent it.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.340
Follow the instructions on the page once you click the URL, okay?

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.810
I'll end this call and be ready to switch over.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.410
Does your sister have pen and paper on hand?

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.390
I think she does.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.610
Then she can communicate by writing over video.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.360
You're right.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.300

Onee-chan, we see you.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.510
We were able to narrow down your location; we'll send a squad your way.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.100
She's quite far off the trail.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.860
- I'm calling a chopper, too.
- Please do.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:28.280
Onee-chan, can you show us who is hurt?

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.630
Isn't that...

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:40.120
Brown jacket, navy pants, and an orange backpack?

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.160
It's the lost boy.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.160
I see now. Mt. Okamine is connected to Sasanodai Forest.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.180
Should I contact the squads currently searching for the boy?

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.570
Kasuhara-san, could you ask her for the boy's name just in case?

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.110
Yes, Ma'am.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.140
Onee-chan, can you ask that boy for his name?

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.130
[What's your name?]

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.380
[Sakurai Ryota]

Sakurai Ryota-kun? Got it.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.440
To all squads currently searching in Sasanodai Forest:
[Sakurai Ryota]

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.740
the missing 11-year-old boy is with a woman

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.060
who has called for help from Mt. Okamine.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.160
I will call with further details, over.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.960
Copy that.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.800
The squad we sent out from Sakae

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.350
is still 2 kilometers from Mt. Okamine.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.240
Your squad from Central might reach them first.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.980
I wonder if he slipped and hurt his leg.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.620
Onee-chan, you're not hurt, are you?

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.460
Kasuhara, get her to show us the boy's face.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.810
Yes, Sir.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.660
Onee-chan, could you show us Ryota-kun's face?

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.540
This is...

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.170
He's showing the first signs of hypothermia.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.330
If his body temperature gets any lower, worst-case scenario...

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.960
His heart could stop.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.510
Onee-chan? Hello? Are you there?

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:27.360
[What should I do to help?]

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.610
[I want to help save this boy.]

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.290
Okay. Let's save him together.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.190
We can't let his temperature get any lower than it already is.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.200
If you have any jackets he could wear, bundle him up.
[Symptoms of hypothermia]

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.600
A picnic blanket would also do the trick.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.750
Share any warm drinks you might have as well.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.950
And if you have any hand warmers,

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.760
place them on his neck, ankle, and armpits.
[Initial Response]

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.570
Rescue squads, this is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.570
The 11-year-old boy is beginning to suffer from hypothermia.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.830
We are currently attempting to keep him warm.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.950
This is Central. Copy that.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.830
We are 400 meters from their location.

This is Yokohama Fire Bureau. Copy that.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.490
- Keep moving!
- Yes, Sir!

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.910
They're almost there.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.650
The rescue squad is about 15 minutes out.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.420
Are we getting interference?

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.950
Hopefully that didn't mess with her GPS.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.710
I'm worried about the weather as well.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.590
Rain clouds are approaching their location.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.340
I suspect rain in the next 20 minutes or so.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.900
Onee-chan, it might start raining soon.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:52.380
Try to move him somewhere he can be dry and out of the rain.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.910
[Ryota-kun looks drowsy.]

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.310

[Ryota-kun looks drowsy.]

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.020
Kasuhara-san, shaking him is more dangerous.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.020
Tell her to let him lie down.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.650
Onee-chan, don't force him to wake up.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.330
Have him lie down as is.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.210
He'll be okay.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.800
The rescue team will arrive soon.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.050
- And the rain?
- Could start any minute now.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.750
- Yokohama Fire Bureau.
- Yokohama Fire Bureau, this is Central.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.920
We've arrived at the designated location,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.240
but we see no individuals within a 50-meter radius.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.510
Their GPS signals are getting messed up.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.030
We will expand our radius and continue our search.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.760
Both individuals needing rescue cannot speak, correct?

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.330
Yes.

Kasuhara-san!

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.850
Rain?

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.210
Onee-chan?

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.860
She's trying to climb up.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.250
Onee-chan, are you okay? Hello?

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:55.560
Can you hear me?

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.570
Onee-chan?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.400
Onee-chan?

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.620
Is anyone there? We've come to help!

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.550
Please make any sort of noise if you're there!

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.270
We've come to help!

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.310
Is anyone there?

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.470
Kasuhara-san!

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.320
They're right here!

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.360
- Both individuals needing rescue are right here!
- Kasuhara Konatsu-san!

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.920
Sakurai Ryota-san!

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.350
They're right here!

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.050
Kasuhara Konatsu-san!

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.650
Both individuals in need of rescue are right here!

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:17.020
I promise I'll be there to help you, no matter what.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.290
I just wanted you to know it'll be okay, and I'm here for you.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.740
Onee-chan, let's leave!

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.480
What do I do? What do I do?

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.720
Onee-chan.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.480
We...

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.830
We're right...

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.720
W-We're right here.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.670
Onee-chan...

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.890
We're right here.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.910
We're right here!

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.250
Please help us!

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.910
We're...

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.580
We're here.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.260
We...

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.340
Onee-chan, you'll be okay. I promise.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.940
Your voice.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.260
Your voice will reach them!

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.770
We're right here!

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.560
Help us!

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.030
We're right here!

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.750
- Both individuals needing resuce have been found!
- Roger that!

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.480
- Are you all right?
- Ma'am, are you okay?

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.880
We have eyes on both individuals. Proceeding with the rescue.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.420
Ma'am, are you unharmed?

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.580
Please help Ryota-kun first.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.760
Bring the blanket!

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.620
Onee-chan.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.390
I'll end this call now, okay?

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.110
Yuki.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.610
Thank you.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:40.000
♫ If only I had been able to forget ♫

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:48.000
♫ Is it still so painful because I don't have the courage to escape? ♫

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.810
I'm glad everything worked out.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.730
Ryota-kun regained consciousness while being transported, too.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.570
Things would've been precarious if not for Kasuhara-san's sister.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.170
She apparently rushed down to save him unconsciously

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.750
when she noticed him off the trail.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.830
I guess the sisters are alike in that respect.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.820
♫ You are calling out to me ♫

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.440
Onee-chan! How are you feeling?

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.170
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:27.290
She twisted her ankle, but the doctor said she's fine otherwise.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.980
I see.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.980
Thank God.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.990
Onee-chan, I'm sorry about the other day.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.080
I said I'd rescue you without letting you get a word in.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:53.030
I didn't even realize the real reason you lost your voice... until now.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.920
I'm so, so sorry.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.460
It was never your fault, Yuki.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.770
Because...

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:16.000
That fire was my fault.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.220
[Preview]

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.820
I'm sorry I never told you all.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.610
Thanks to you, we were rescued, Onee-chan.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.700
- Sir, what is this?
- It's exactly what it says it is.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.950
Dojima-san, you promised me back then.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.820
You told me we would be okay.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.220
Dispatch Class-1.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.920
Dispatching the following squads:

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.830
SR Rescue Unit 2, SR Crane Unit.
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.730
The dispatch order system at Command is down.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:41.840
What's with that "Legend" nickname anyway?

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.950
Rumor has it Dojima-san was an expert at giving verbal dispatch orders.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.560
Apparently, his tone alone could indicate how grave the situation was.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.980
That day was Yuki's birthday, right?

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.720
The second car seems squashed. I think people are stuck inside.
