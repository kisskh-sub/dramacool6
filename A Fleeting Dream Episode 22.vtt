00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.999
Who's that?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.959
(Missing Person Notice)

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.720
A missing person notice?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.880
The Pei family posted
two notices at once.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760
Something serious must have happened.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.259
(Pei Xueshan, female, 23 years old,
generous rewards)

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.740

gravely ill, generous rewards)

(Pei Residence)

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.239
What do you think
Miss Lian is suffering from?

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.159
So many doctors have come
these past few days,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.720
but none have been able to cure her.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.719
Who knows?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840
Miss Xueshan is missing too.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.159
The Pei family has been having

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.720
nothing but trouble lately.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.280
Miss Lian,
my medical skills aren't enough

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.719
to cure your illness.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.200
You and Mr. Pei should seek
someone more competent.

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:02.719
Thank you.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:04.559
See him out.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.639
Yes, sir.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.680
Any updates?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.439
Our men have searched
the docks and bus stations

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.120
but haven't found Pei Xueshan yet.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.758
Many saw the notices and claimed

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.038
they saw her around the city.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.119
Seems like
she's still somewhere in Hu City.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.599
Looks like she's waiting
for me to die from poison.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.919
We can't wait.
We're running out of time.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.639
Wen Yuan, I'm coming with you
this afternoon. We'll find her together.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.480
No.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.759
You're still weak.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:32.999
You stay home.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.358
Wen Yuan, let's go.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.479
Yuze! Pei Yuze!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.440
Second Master, what's wrong?

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.038
I'm fine. Let's continue the search.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.239
No, Second Master.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.760
You must return and rest.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.639
Search that area.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.560
You two, follow me.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.999
Pei Yuze! Pei Yuze! Wake up!

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.280
Someone! Anyone! Help!

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:25.119
Help!

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.060
(Pei Residence)

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640
Another funeral at the Pei Residence.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.160
- What's going on with the Pei family?
- I wonder what's going on.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.700
(Tablet of Beloved Husband Pei Yuze)

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.900
(Memorial)

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.840
Miss Lian, you haven't eaten all day.
You should inside and rest for a bit.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.920
If the Second Master
saw you like this, he'd worry.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.519
Envoy, I just received news.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.759
Pei Yuze has died from poisoning.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.400
Pei Xueshan.

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.759
You'd better reclaim control
of the Pei family this time.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.720
Don't delay the general's plans.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.160
Rest assured.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.959
I won't let him down this time.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.318
Remember your promise.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.118
We plan to take action
one week from now.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.159
Before that,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.000
the Hu City Commander must die.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.359
And please keep your word

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.679
that once this is done,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.680
you must help me become chairwoman
of the Southeast Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.020
(Pei Residence)

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.540
(Memorial)

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.880
Uncle Yuze,
you've always been frail and sickly.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.280
Now, you're finally free.

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:54.679
I'm here to see you off.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.639
Uncles.

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.719
Uncle Yuze passed before
he could officially become family head.

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:10.559
He left so suddenly.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.120
Have we chosen the new family head yet?

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.239
He left too soon.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.079
The Pei family is now leaderless,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.640
and we don't know what to do.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.079
I think Miss Xueshan

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.319
would be a suitable candidate.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.599
What did you say?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.879
How could the Pei family
have a woman as head?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.959
Times have changed.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.198
What's wrong with a woman
leading the family?

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.199
That's right.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.359
Third Granduncle, why don't you name

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.080
someone more capable than me?

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:38.079
The Pei family's...

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.360
No matter who you recommend,

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:43.318
I have ways to make them disappear.

00:08:43.319 --> 00:08:44.399
You...

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:48.359
I, Pei Xueshan,
am capable and ambitious.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:52.319
If I become the head of the Pei family,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.759
I'll make the Pei family
a leading commercial empire

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.079
across the Southeast,
and even the whole country!

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.559
Uncles,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.079
you should know

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.238
whom to choose by now.

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:05.399
I support Miss Xueshan.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.439
I do too.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.318
You...

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:08.839
Then, it's settled.

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:11.239
Not so fast.

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.079
Miss Xinruo.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:22.519
Lian Xinruo, you're not even married
to Uncle Yuze yet.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.999
What right does an outsider have
to interfere in the Pei family?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.318
Ten years ago, you poisoned Yuze,

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:29.919
and now you collude with the Japanese

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.400
and used Jiang Yao to poison me.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.680
There isn't a single thing you did
that wasn't unforgivable.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.600
But it doesn't matter.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.599
Since you dared come back,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.240
you won't leave.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:40.439
You've said a lot,
but do you have proof?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.280
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.280
Give me the antidote.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.839
What antidote?
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.599
Don't be fooled by Jiang Yao.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.999
He was once devoted to you,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.638
but you cast him aside.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:55.559
Then, you got involved with Uncle Yuze

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.320
and made yourself his elder.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.238
He poisoned you
out of love turned to hate.

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:04.119
It has nothing to do with me.

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:07.919
What do you want?

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.678
Answer my questions.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.158
Don't try anything.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.399
If you refuse,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.680
I'll slash your face

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:20.198
until it's nothing but scars.

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:23.718
Lian Xinruo, if you dare hurt me
in front of all these people,

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:25.119
you won't get away with it!

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.159
So what if I hand it over?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.879
Pei Yuze is already dead.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.319
Who told you he's dead?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.840
Wen Yuan, bring him out.

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:42.159
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.120
Lian Xinruo, you tricked me!

00:10:58.719 --> 00:10:59.759
Wen Yuan!

00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:02.359
Wen Yuan, are you all right?

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:03.759
Where is he?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.839
Wen Yuan! Help!

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.039
Someone!

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:13.959
Miss Xinruo!

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.480
Miss Xinruo.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.959
Get him to the hospital, now!

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.320
Call the doctor!

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:28.879
Did you see the Second Master?

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.198
Miss Lian, Mr. Jiang took
the Second Master away.

00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:32.759
Which direction did they go?

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920
That way.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.940
(Rui'anxiang Ginseng & Herbs Shop)

00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:41.759
Look at these hands.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.520
They obviously belong to a spoiled
rich kid who's never done a day's work.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.039
Now look at mine.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.480
When I was born,

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:59.439
my father was just a poor bookkeeper.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.080
We lived in a cramped attic

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:07.159
down a narrow lane.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.160
For Chinese New Year,

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:12.319
we couldn't even afford new clothes.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.920
The neighborhood kids laughed

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.120
and insulted us.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:22.679
Later, my father earned
Mr. Lian's recognition

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.680
and we moved into the Lian Residence.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.919
Our lives improved.

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:32.879
That was the happiest time of my life.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:36.439
I never dreamed

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.720
Xinruo would agree to marry me.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.520
After I graduated,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.158
Xinruo was going to be my wife,

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:51.919
and I would become
the future head of the Lian family.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.680
But then my father died.

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.759
Xinruo disappeared.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.680
I lost everything again.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.640
No.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.999
I've already lost Xinruo.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.360
I won't go back to that dark,
damp, tiny attic ever again.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.480
I'm going to climb higher.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.359
I'm going to rise above them all.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.679
Since I got engaged to Xueshan,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.080
I've been walking on eggshells
around the Pei family,

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:23.879
enduring mockery and scorn.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.520
I was on the verge of success.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.120
But it's all because of you!

00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:32.239
All of a sudden, you came back.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.519
You didn't just steal Xinruo from me.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.760
You took everything
that rightfully belonged to me.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.960
The Pei family has all
deceived me, used me!

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.280
You all deserve to die!

00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:54.079
If Xinruo saw you like this,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.120
she'd be heartbroken.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.559
You good-for-nothing fool.

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:10.039
Xinruo should only have feelings for me!

00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.359
I'm the only one she should love!

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.959
Look.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.300
(Tablet of Beloved Wife Lian Xinruo)

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.640
I've prepared everything.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.160
Jiang Yao.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.120
You've lost your mind.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.319
Once Xinruo dies,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.120
I'll join her.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.600
We'll be buried together.

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:48.359
We'll never be apart again.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.400
And you...

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.300
(Tablets of Beloved Wife Lian Xinruo
and Beloved Husband Jiang Yao)

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:09.999
You filthy thing.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.760
You don't deserve Xinruo.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.479
I'll carve off every inch of your body

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.840
that touched her

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.839
and feed it

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.119
to the dogs.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.479
Tell me, how should I kill you

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.080
so Xinruo hates me just a little more?

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:36.919
Coward, do it if you dare!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Yuze!

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.800
I'm here to save you.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:50.359
Xinruo, open your eyes!

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.320
He's our enemy!

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.080
Let us go.

00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.199
Xinruo,

00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:58.318
the Pei family are all liars.

00:15:58.319 --> 00:15:59.519
He'll hurt you.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.880
Come with me. I'll take you away.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.480
We'll leave Hu City together, okay?

00:16:05.359 --> 00:16:07.039
Come to your senses.

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:14.199
