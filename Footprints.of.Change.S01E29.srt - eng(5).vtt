[Episode 29]

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.460
Why didn't you invite your boyfriend in?

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.479
He just came to bring me the keys.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.789
I left in a hurry and forgot to take them.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.830
Beichuan has night classes
at school tonight.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.870
He's quite funny.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.060
He seems very attached to you.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.120
I need to talk to him about this
when I get back.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.310
That was too rude.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.110
How could he come here directly?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.850
What book did you say
you wanted to show me?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.630
I'll go get it.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.040
Is Shan Huajing home?

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.150
Search warrant.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.840
Who is it?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.860
Ms. Shan.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.600
Which one of you is Shan Huajing?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.840
I am.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.710
Ms. Shan,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.300
if there's nothing else, I'll get going.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.360
Wait.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.120
What's your relationship
with Shan Huajing?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.680
Why are you in her home?

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.630
We went to the same school.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.350
She's my senior.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.520
I just came to chat with her.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.900
What's in your bag?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.840
Open it.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.270
You can go now.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.740
Why are you crying?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.150
I'm not feeling well.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.000
Then go home and rest.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.970
We need to talk to Shan Huajing.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.250
Okay.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.000
Section Chief Shan,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.070
I just need a quick word with Xining.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.740
Xiang Beichuan, what are you doing here?

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.390
I'm asking you.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.680
Are you crazy?

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.120
Jie.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.710
Well,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.740
Ms. Shan is in trouble. Did you know?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.680
Okay.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.440
I'll let you know once I book the flight.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.200
Alright, thank you.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.260
I'm hanging up now.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.190
This batch of goods
has a strict time limit.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.920
Sea freight takes 40 days.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.190
If we wait another 30 days to send it out,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.820
it'll miss the sales window.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.960
Could you please

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.790
help us

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.270
talk to your supervisor?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.150
Shan Huajing's case
hasn't been cleared yet.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.960
All our business dealings related to her

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.510
are temporarily frozen.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680
Sorry about that.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.480
Okay, thank you.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.670
Thank you.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.050
Have you eaten?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.510
Yes, I have.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.600
You should go to work now.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.400
Don't be late.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.670
Are you...

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.330
I'm fine.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.880
I'm alright.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.200
Beichuan.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.450
What is it, Mr. Guo?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.240
Congratulations on your new book.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.280
Although it's your first work,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.440
I can see

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.670
you have great literary talent.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.550
Your writing is smooth,
and your ideas are profound.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.270
I've read so many novels,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.000
but yours is the only one

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.130
worth reading repeatedly—

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.530
it keeps me captivated.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.690
Mr. Guo, you flatter me.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.790
Guys, come out!

Weren't you all asking for his autograph?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.120
Line up and get it one by one.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.750
Hurry!

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.390
Okay.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.720
Professor Xiang, congratulations.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.630
Your work is really excellent.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.440
Could you sign this for me?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:36.890
Thank you.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.770

Please return to the classroom now.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.710
I'll see you in class.

have a wish for you:

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.490
May you keep writing tirelessly,
dedicating yourself fully,

pouring your sweat onto both the podium
and the literary world.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.940
Thank you.

Thank you.

Here's the money you lent me before.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.390
No need. Keep it for yourself.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.570
I'll be away for a while.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.670
Take care of yourself.

Where are you going?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.240
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong—

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.200
I have friends in all these places.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.550
I'll leave you a phone number later.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.750
If anything urgent comes up,

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.810
just give me a call.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.890
Okay. I'll be going then.

Thank you.

Professor Xiang, I really admire you.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.810
Thank you.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.750
Jerk,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.270
isn't this your paper?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.460
This jerk's paper got published.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.930
Sir, I'll take ten copies.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.120
Why so many?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.390
Can you even read them all?

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.780
I'm giving them to others as gifts.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.300

You're not vain?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.150
You don't want to be famous?

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.190
To be honest,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.050
fame doesn't matter much

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.100

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.670
My main task

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.360
is to turn my observations into papers

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.540
that readers can engage with,
and that's enough.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.450
I'm vain.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.220
I'm proud that your book got published.

Jiuling,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.200
you were right.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.240
I'm really not cut out for business.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.350
I've already closed down this company,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.390
and the equipment in the factory
has all been mortgaged to the bank.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.930
So what are you planning to do next?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440
I'll just accept my fate

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.900
and go back to my old trade—

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.380
the textile industry.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.480
I'll open a small factory

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.500
and focus only on production.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.090
Then in the future,
when we get stock from you,

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.670
you'll have to give us a discount.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.630
Of course.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.830
You can't make a profit from us.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.270
I'll give you factory price.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:03.800
Alright.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.670

You should rent

This won't do.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:22.960
Right.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.160
Once you get that small factory running,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.810
Xiang Beichuan!

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.640
I've missed you so much!

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.030
Did you miss me?

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:44.960
I didn't.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.780
You're lying.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.480
Why would I lie to you?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.740
Why didn't you miss me?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.290
Why should I miss you?

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.480
I went to the old house looking for you.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.850
Why did you move out?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:55.640
Yes.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.860
I moved out.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.400
Why are you looking for me?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
To date you.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.230
I've made money.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.060
I've made lots and lots of money.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.210
Come on. Let's go to the mall.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.380
The outfit you're wearing
is the one I bought you before.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.450
I'll get you a new one,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.210
a designer brand,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.410
and pair it with a bag.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.870
Tonight, we'll go out to eat

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.480
at the best restaurant in Shanghai.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.880
Order whatever you want.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.450
Let's go.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.610

[Fuxing Restaurant]

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.060
Mr. Yan.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.440
Come, have a seat.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.030
How's the jet lag?

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.510
Not so good.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.180
Have you seen Xiang Beichuan?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.820
Yes, I have.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.370
How did it go?

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.610
Pretty well.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200
Pretty well, huh?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.480
I ordered

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.640
sweet and sour spare ribs

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.750
and smoked fish for you.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.350
They're all your favorites.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.900
The taste hasn't changed.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.580
They haven't changed their chef?

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.780
It's still Chef Liu.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.240
Mr. Yan, I heard

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.680
you're still working at the old house.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.960
You're such an accomplished entrepreneur—

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.760
why didn't you move
to a top-tier office building?

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.200
I quite like the old house

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.270
because

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.970
it holds so many wonderful memories.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.830
How about you?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.750
Where are you working
now that you're back?

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.310
I had Jiuling renew the lease

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.570
on Mr. Lu's old office.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.190
One reason is convenience;

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.690
another is that

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.960
I started my business here before,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.540
and now that I'm back,
I want to start fresh here again.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.270
Looks like we're both sentimental people.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.600
We're still neighbors.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.480
We'll have to help each other out at work.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.080
Don't worry. If there's anything I can do,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.160
just let me know.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.030
During this past year,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.360
have you been in touch with Beichuan much?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.940
He and his senior
opened a cultural company.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.460
I wonder how it turned out.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.950
I haven't kept in touch
with Beichuan much.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.550
I invite you to dinner,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.160
and you don't ask how I'm doing

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.580
but keep asking about Xiang Beichuan.
That's not appropriate.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.840
I was just about to ask.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.030
How have you been?

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.010
Not good.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.350
I've been single all this time.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.590
That can't be true.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.720
You're so handsome

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.550
and charming,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.230
surrounded by beautiful women.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.290
You're the least likely to be single.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.610
I've been single in spirit all this time.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.320
It's just that
I've had a lot of social events.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.480
Alright,
it's been a year since we last met.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.200
We've caught up enough.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.210
Are you hungry?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.200
Waitress.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.770
Hurry up with the dishes.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.570
Alright, sir.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:19.850
Li.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.750
Mr. Yan.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.370
Xining is back.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.510
Take good care of her.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.040
Alright.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.400
Split it between you two.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.310
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.240
Enjoy your meal.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.020
You really deserve your name.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.500
This is the new

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.460
clothing export company I set up
after coming back.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.350
Take a look

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.540
and see
if you're interested in collaborating.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.790
Whatever your first deal is

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:53.850
after coming back,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.360
I'll fully support you.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.150
I'll toast you with tea.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.750
Just have some wine—why tea?

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.840
I can't. I'll be driving later.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.690
Fine,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:06.930
tea it is.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.720
Beichuan.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.310
I'm here.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.320
If you're thirsty,
pour yourself some water.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.870
Why are you living here?

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.160
I'm seeking inspiration among mortals.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.360
What are you talking about?

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.240
Mortals?

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.030
Are there immortals?

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.200
You're classifying people

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.900
into different ranks.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.280
I need to criticize you for that.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.480
You have a point.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.800
There's quiet within the noise,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.610
and noise within the quiet—

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.200
it's good for your writing.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.880
But

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.040
living here

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.590
means no girls will come by.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.590
If you ever get a girlfriend,

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.450
how could you live here like this?

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.830
Who says a man

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.560
must have a woman by his side?

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.030
And who says a woman

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.300
must have a man?

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.030
You're not going to say
you like me next, are you?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.360
Get lost.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.260
I saw Ye Xining today.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.740
She's back.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.180
How did she react when she saw you?

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.570
She ran over to me from far away

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.790
and gave me a hug.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.350
That's great!

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.110
It means she still loves you.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.550
I don't know.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.140
I still don't understand

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.710
why she was so determined

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.350
to break up with me a year ago.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.030
You're driving me crazy
with this attitude.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.230
Do you still love her?

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.060
Of course not.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.680
Bro,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.670
you're quite something.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.790
I've been hesitant to tell you this,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.440
but from the very beginning,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.840
I felt you two
weren't right for each other.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.020
Why?

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.040
Why?

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.210
It's a feeling I can't explain.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.980
You two need to figure it out yourselves.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.860
I have a cousin

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.140
who teaches at a university.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.730
I think you should meet her.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.510
Really.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.640
I think she's someone

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.240
who could live with you
in a partition room.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.110
Just think—

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.590
in summer,

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.510
you ride your little bike with her

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.350
to go grocery shopping

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.400
or watch a movie.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.710
She'd feel so happy.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.900
She's not that materialistic.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.540
Do you think

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.880
the differences between women

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.920
can be that big?

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.880
Of course.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.680
What about between men?

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.040
It's the same.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.920
I don't think so.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.270
Xiang Beichuan...

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.000
This little house is just a storage now.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.750
Nobody lives here.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.310
I made some money and moved out.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.240
You're going to live here
now that you're back?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.830
Yes.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.530
You'll live here?

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:19.330
Alright then.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.720
I'll clean it up for you tomorrow.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.830
Then you can move in.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.450
Okay.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.160
Now that you're back from Europe,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.310
who's handling the shipments?

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.880
I hired two people over there

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880
to handle our shipments.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880
Will that work?

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.630
They're very professional.
There's no problem.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.160
Xining,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.510
tell me the truth.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.950
Why did you really

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.080
come back this time?

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.110
If it's for work,

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.030
you didn't need to come back at all.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.230
So it must be for love.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.360
You came back for Beichuan.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.290
I didn't come back for him.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.440
Xining,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.270
I read a book the other day,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.170
and it said some really good things.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.570
It said that

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.120
a woman shouldn't imagine a man
as perfect,

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.570
because he can't be perfect in real life.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.490
That would just put too much pressure
on him.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.240
For a woman,

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.920
if she loves too intensely,

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.550
she becomes too sensitive.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.960
Even the tiniest crack

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.200
gets magnified by her.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.550
And what about men?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.960
It's the same.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.030
Think about it—

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.640
if a man treats you like a goddess—

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.410
but you're not actually a goddess

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.070
and have so many flaws—

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.680
doesn't that make you exhausted
and under a lot of pressure?

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.030
And his love

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.480
will also be intense.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.580
Then he'll become very sensitive.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.310
Then

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.200
even the tiniest crack

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.740
will get magnified by him as well.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.510
So are you saying

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.060
men and women

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.520
shouldn't love too intensely?

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.270
No.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.510
Then what are you saying?

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.640
Love is about managing

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.620
and exercising restraint.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.110
Mr. Guo,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.970
I believe this is my class.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.070
Professor Xiang.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.160
Come here.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.160
Beichuan,

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.750
about the apartment,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.860
I've always been grateful to you.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.960
Today,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.200
they insisted I substitute for you.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.740
I said I wouldn't come,

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200
but everyone in our department

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.790
insisted.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.830
They said only my teaching skills

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.640
are on the same level as yours.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.510
Mr. Guo,

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.700
you're substituting for me?

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.400
I know about

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.140
that thing of yours.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.000
Others might think

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.450
it's kind of shady,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.110
but to me,

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.660
you're very brave

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.310
when it comes to love.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.130
I've always thought
you're a truly genuine person.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.270
What thing?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.340
How come I don't even know about this
myself?

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.400
Love in Partition Room.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.330
Love in Partition Room?

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.930
Professor Xiang,
could you come out for a moment?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.480
It's been a pleasure working with you.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.550
Thank you.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.750
I hope we can work together again.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.590
Sure thing.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.310
Take care, Mr. Liu.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.030
Alright.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.720
Take care.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.680
How is it?

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.880
How's the booth?

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:04.720
Look.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.850
Ours is a step higher than the others'.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.510
Normally, that would make it 5,000 yuan
more expensive,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:13.020
but I got it without adding a cent.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.070
It was mainly because
your products are good.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.480
The brand you represent is great.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.590
That's why our products sell well.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.350
That's why they gave us the best spot.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.960
Right?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.590
Alright, Jiuling.

We're going to do better and better.

Right now,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.480
I'm going to build my own brand.

I'll work with you from now on.

Of course. We make such a great team.

I need to get back to class.

Beichuan,

you're a young teacher
I personally selected.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.710
I have

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.010
high expectations for you.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.650
And now you're resigning?

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.400
You're not Yan Jun.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:40.560
You don't know how to do business.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.389
Jobs are hard to find these days.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.400
If you resign,

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.270
how will you survive?

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.070
Mr. Zhong,

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.969
I think what you said about me is right.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.030
I am indeed sometimes too rigid.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.630
And as you said,

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.880
as a teacher,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.960
it's not enough to just know my subject—

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.290
I should also know
how to deal with people.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.030
But to be honest,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.860
I don't really want to learn that,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.350
and I don't want to be too sophisticated.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.460
Can you forgive me?

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.240
Don't worry.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.550
I'll submit a formal resignation

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.360
to the department later,

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.790

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.770
What are you doing here?

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.030
We're good friends of Professor Xiang.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.360
We called you here today

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.150
to figure out how to handle
this situation.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.800
How's Professor Xiang doing?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.000
I called the school.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.920
He's already resigned.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.710
How could this happen?

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.480
Didn't you know

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.550
this would happen

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.280
when you were writing
that so-called novel?

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.630
I was writing a novel.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.920
Novels are purely fictional.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.730
Who would actually take it
as being about themselves?

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.250
But you mixed real people's looks, jobs,

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.340
and personalities

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.190
with fictional plots.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.670
It's impossible not to make people think
it's about a specific person.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.130
And you included all of us.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.480
Yes.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.080
You even wrote that I'm like a horny dog.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.740
We barely know each other.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.190
I didn't write about you.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.150
You're the one reading yourself into it.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.680
It has nothing to do with me.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.760
Tong Tong,

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.570
we've consulted a lawyer.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.900
If a lot of people believe

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.670
your novel is about a specific person,

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.190
and that person suffers
negative consequences

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.590
because of your work,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.000
they could sue you

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.080
for defamation.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.760
I don't know these things.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.800
I thought that as long as
I put at the beginning of the novel,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.210
"This story is purely fictional;

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.110
please don't read yourself into it,"
it would be fine.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.710
Besides,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.670
Professor Xiang is such a good person.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.320
How could I possibly harm him?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.360
Professor Xiang

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.910
has now resigned because of you.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.690
Back when you were selling shirts
in the school dorm,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.960
Professor Xiang
used his school apartment quota

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.820
to protect you,

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.800
so you didn't get punished by the school.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.880
What did you say?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.880
You can check with the school
if it's true or not.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.080
What you need to do now

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.150
is write a formal statement

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:57.110
clarifying that the story's main character
isn't Xiang Beichuan.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.040
That way, even though he resigned,

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.670
he won't be too embarrassed

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.150
when he meets his old colleagues

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.610
or students in the future.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.000
I know.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.280
I'll do it.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.960
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.960
Don't act like you're the only one
who cares about him.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.350
What are you here for?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.880
Professor Xiang...

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.710
I'm sorry.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.030
I don't accept your apology.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.050
You can go back to class now.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.580
I've already been disciplined
by the school.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.460
Professor Xiang,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.670
here's...

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.670
here's all my royalties.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.580
I'm giving it all to you.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.800
It's all because of me

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.320
that you lost your job.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.580
Take it, just to get by.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.670
Stop following me.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.190
Do you really have to keep ruining me

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.790
over and over
until I'm completely disgraced?

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.000
I don't.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.280
Xiang Bei...

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.570
Stop following me.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.230
Tong Tong,

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.390
are you really going to destroy

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.060
the last bit of student-teacher bond

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.980
we have left?

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:37.630
I...

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.590
As a girl,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.490
I hope you can show some self-respect.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:44.760
Alright.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.560
Can we still be friends?

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.920
Are you out of your mind?

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.620
No!
