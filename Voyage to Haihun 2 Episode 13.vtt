=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 13=

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.370
Is it true that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.340
every male of Heaven Rank

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.120
is paired with a lady of Earth Rank?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
I've said before.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.720
It is the duty of Earth Rank women.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.080
- Rogue!
- Sorry.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.230
Come on.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.710
Can't you see I'm bestowing blessings?

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.810
Wang Heng.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.400
It's so late.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.760
What are you doing with that basin?

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.190
I went to wash up.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.030
You went alone?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.120
Of course.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.960
Let me tell you this.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.960
A young lady must be careful
when away from home.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.520
There are many with ill intentions.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.500
I'll walk you back to your room.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.640
Shouldn't you be warning
the ill-doers instead?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.830
They should watch out for me.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.290
Not all villains rely on force.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.130
This place is dangerous.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.700
If you breathe in poison
grinding the sacred herb,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.000
you might end up doing
something you'd regret.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.520
What exactly would I do?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.160
In Chang'an, I let you be.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.630
But now, we're working here.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.470
I'm your superior.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.990
You must follow my lead.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.310
Let's go.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.360
Lan'er.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.080
Wang said he doesn't like me,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.850
so he never saw me as family.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.100
That's why he kept his distance.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.030
He should. It's so late.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.550
I never let her get close.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.940
So, this is the regret you spoke of.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.730
I was only trying
to save you from regret.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.260
(Jingkou Village)

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.320
Wang Heng.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.540
I heard you united
Heaven and Earth last night.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.960
Such joyous news!

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710
What do you mean?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.620
You're Heaven, and she's Earth.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.920
Last night, she willingly served you.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.030
That's uniting Heaven and Earth.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.630
It brings endless vitality.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.740
What nonsense.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.440
No need to act shy.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.040
It's a blessing for a new family member.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.910
She might even share
in your good fortune

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.870
and attend the Blessing Ceremony.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.880
This Earth Rank family member.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.690
I've been watching you for days.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.520
You're as cold as winter frost.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.510
Rarely speaking a word.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.500
If you go on like this,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.380
how will you fit into the family?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.680
Or receive Mistress's blessing?

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.870
How about this?

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.240
Why not accept my blessing?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.870
Didn't you bestow one last night?

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.760
Hey.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.190
Have you heard that greater power
means greater duty?

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.200
Come on, let's go.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.480
Wang.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.650
Lan'er, stop trailing me.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.360
Please, after you.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.280
What's the matter?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.870
Starting today,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.760
your task is to record
the numbers they choose.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.640
Oh, right.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.150
What does the blessing mean?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
If you're bestowed,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.100
you'll regret it.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.180
Disgusting.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.230
Yes, truly disgusting.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.220
But don't worry.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.920
I'll keep you safe.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.090
No one will dare touch you.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.640
Who'd dare get close to me?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.190
Exactly, no one dares get near you.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.120
But if you strike at those villains,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.600
won't our entire cover be blown?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.860
Don't worry.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.050
I know my limits.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.610
Limits should be set by the leader,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.340
which, in this case, is me.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.480
You

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.580
just stay within three steps of me.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.320
Wang.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.230
Congratulations to you.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.260
So early.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.120
Of course.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.450
I must work hard

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.110
to reach Heaven Rank asap

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.000
so as to meet Mistress

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.380
and receive her blessing.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.020
Did you note it down for me?

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.780
I did.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.720
Horse Wang.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.830
Your shoulder is bleeding.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.170
You should rest a while.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.830
I must keep going.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.680
I have to toil.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.360
My sins weigh heavily.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.870
I must earn the blessing quota.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.470
Only then can I meet Mistress soon

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.360
and gain her blessing.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.780
Alright, back to work.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.270
All family members, off to work!

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.240
Come on, time to work.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.160
Time to work.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.010
Move, move.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.060
Mark more for Horse Wang.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.920
Hurry, hurry.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.170
Keep up.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.040
Go.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.440
- Why not go with them?
- Keep up.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.190
I'll just watch you from here.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.510
Don't we have someone for Mortal Rank?

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.230
Yeah.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.480
Family, gather up.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.600
Mortal Rank family.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.630
It's so good to see you all.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.430
Come on, line up.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.710
Form a line, come on, please.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.750
Here, this is yours.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.720
Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.480
This one's for you.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.550
Thank you.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.060
Thank you.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.670
Hold it tight.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.600
Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.910
This is yours.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.800
Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.380
Always at Mistress's service.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.720
It's true; it's real gold biscuits!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.600
Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.400
Always at Mistress's service.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.410
Come on.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.320
This is yours.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.140
Dear family.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.000
We will deliver these gold biscuits

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.030
into your family's hands.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.470
- We...
- Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.960
It's a real gold biscuit.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.090
We'll also tell them
you're doing well here.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.250
Thanks to Mistress.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.780
I believe each of us will be bestowed

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.360
with Mistress's blessing.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.130
Everyone will receive

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.010
Mistress's trust.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.560
Aren't you new here?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.670
You don't have one.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.480
I didn't expect it to be true.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.610
I can finally take a wife.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.710
Heng.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.220
Everyone here has gone mad.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.440
Completely mad.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.360
Even Lan'er has lost her senses.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.500
She wants to serve me
instead of looking for her parents,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.660
calling it a blessing.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.230
Utterly insane.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.640
Well, you are a Heaven Rank man.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.920
Alright, alright.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.640
The way they're behaving

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.640
is no different from those workers
building your mausoleum.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.150
You know what?

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.870
Those workers worked faster and better.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.840
Tell me.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.340
Do they really need to go this far
for some gold?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.110
All mortals suffer, Marquis.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.170
Anyway, the gold is clearly unusual.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.720
Except for you,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.050
who could have so much gold?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.010
You think this gold came from me?

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.160
Yeah.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.750
What's your plan?

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.230
Let's wait.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.660
Lan'er's gone mad.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.650
What about Senior?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.710
De Jiu.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.480
Isn't this going too far?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.750
I know you.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.160
I don't want you to make a mistake.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.790
I admit I'm no match for you.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.590
Since I can't receive Wang's blessing,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.610
I'll have another family member
give me one.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.030
That should work, right?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.030
Why are you still stopping me?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.290
Because you'll regret it.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.430
This is something I chose willingly.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.760
Why would I regret it?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.390
What does Mistress possess

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.000
to make you so fearless?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.840
How dare you!

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.550
Mistress's abilities

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.290
are not for you to speak lightly of.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.730
You are a woman, too.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.430
You should understand
her painstaking efforts best.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.830
On her own,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.210
she's brought many people
hope and a better life.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.460
To receive her blessing

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.110
is a fortune in life.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.720
Don't stand in my way.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.790
Fortunes in life

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.730
need no dependence.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.640
We women have our own choices, too.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.940
This is a waste of breath.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.880
This is all I can do.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.960
This time, I can't help you.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.620
Impressive skills, Senior.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.630
Good night.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.000
I heard everything you said.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.360
You were right.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.700
And you acted even better.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.980
Why not send her back?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.340
Consider it to bestow a blessing.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.460
It will fulfill her goodwill.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.530
I should keep a proper distance.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.480
You do it.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.990
Are you tired?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.400
Let me walk you back.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.540
Get some rest early.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.870
I have nowhere to go.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.430
I'll just find somewhere
to get by for the night.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.580
Why?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.610
An Earth Rank girl
chosen by a Heaven Rank

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.140
can no longer return.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.360
Then

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.500
where are you staying?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.900
What do you think?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.330
This Heaven Rank family member.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.680
I'll show you the way.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.470
I've made up the bed.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.460
Get some rest early.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.340
Please.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.220
Well...

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.560
The bedding's just been changed.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.050
It's spotless.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.350
And the water.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.120
I just boiled the hot water.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.820
I added a bit of cool water to it.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.190
Now, the temperature's just right.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.300
You can use it right away.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.580
What about you?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.480
Me?

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.200
I'll just find somewhere
to get by for the night.
