00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.079
Listen.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.120
If you possess me while I sleep,

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.480
I will kill myself.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.280
You're overestimating
yourself, aren't you?

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.079
Your filthy body,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.159
I refuse to enter it again.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.000
I've never met anyone as foolish as you.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.960
Voluntarily seeking punishment?

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.800
Once you recover,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.879
we'll go retrieve my body
from the Divine Sword.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.960
This time, the Night Deity
nearly took the Divine Sword.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.560
We must strengthen our defenses.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.759
300 years have passed.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.159
The Night Deity has fully resurrected.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.520
Re-sealing the Night Deity
is now urgent.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.639
We urgently need to select

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.659
a new Divine Sword Master
from our disciples.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.479
All elders and disciples
under my authority

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.479
may register for the contest.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.680
Father, Master,

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.800
I'll participate.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.000
Good.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.319
Sign up.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.400
What?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.400
Sign up.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.400
Be the Sword Master
and get the Divine Sword.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.819
I know.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.039
My lord,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.759
I want to register.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.219
She's signing up too?

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:32.979
Then I'll register too.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.360
You're...?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.039
Bai Xiaoying
isn't even a junior disciple.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.960
She's merely a mortal cleaner

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.719
from the Yunxiu Pavilion.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.000
Oh.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.680
Since she's from the Yunxiu Pavilion,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.240
Yunya,

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.759
what do you think?

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.080
Just now, you said cultivation level

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.919
and status

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.879
didn't affect.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.879
I believe

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:59.719
this rule stands.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.439
I trust your judgment.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.039
People from the Yunxiu Pavilion
show commendable courage.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.879
You may participate.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.319
Junior disciples
at the Divine Sword Trial Assembly

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.740
are already ridiculous.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.360
Now even cleaning servants?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.079
She's overreaching herself.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.160
Exactly!

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.920
With such weak spiritual power,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.240
why bother competing?

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.240
No matter.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.240
Just a practice target for us.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.839
I'll help you get the Divine Sword

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.959
to regain my body.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.360
Okay.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.079
But remember.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.800
When I get the Divine Sword,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.839
it means your death.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.019
I've tolerated you long enough.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:56.139
Who do you think you are?

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.860
Provoking me repeatedly?

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:00.699
Kill me,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.379
and you'll never regain your body.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.779
How dare you threaten me?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.319
What if I killed your mother?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.519
I'll kill you next.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.839
I'll kill your master,

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.839
your sect,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.560
and everyone who defies me.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.319
How dare you mess with me?

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.079
You hate me, don't you?

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.920
And you fear me too.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.120
Demonic energy...

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.720
Why give me demonic energy?

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.360
To make you stronger

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.040
and make you a demon.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.279
Your talent is exceptionally poor.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.519
Forget rapid cultivation progress.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.600
You can't even fly.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.300
Without me,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.959
you'll remain a lowly weakling
with minimal spiritual power for life.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.079
You're turning me into a demon?

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.439
You should say,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.439
"This is an honor."

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.579
Kill me if you want.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:33.959
Don't insult me.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.839
I love seeing you become

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.420
the wicked demon you despise.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.579
Very soon,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.959
you'll lose control

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.540
and become like me.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.079
No way.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.980
What happened?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.980
I can conjure water.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.060
I have an immortal root!

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.379
That's just my demonic energy

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.060
disguised as your immortal root.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.259
But you've truly mastered it poorly.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.379
Let me teach you.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.740
What?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.300
Stop it!

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.279
Now, you know what to do.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.720
Don't defy me.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.600
I might still consider
sparing your pathetic life.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.220
Bai Xiaoying, what are you doing?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.600
Xiaoying?

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.699
Is it an intruder from the Night Clan?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.860
Go inform the Master.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:53.740
Xiaoying.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.779
Are you there?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.240
Sorry.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.720
I was practicing.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360
My cultivation has grown.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.000
I accidentally lost control.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.279
Come on.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.160
You don't have an immortal root.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:06.000
How could you perform spells?

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.720
There's something else.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.040
It seems I should report this
to the Master and elders.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.620
No, no!

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.300
Please don't!

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.279
Yunqu.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.720
To be honest,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.920
I've developed an immortal root.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.519
Look.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.059
I can't control it well yet.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.820
I was afraid you'd laugh at me.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.279
Xiaoying.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.940
You have an immortal root now?

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.259
Yes.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.519
Thank God.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.039
When the Divine Sword awakened,

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.100
I happened to be practicing.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.940
It activated my meridians

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.100
and immortal root.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.740
I feel my cultivation
increasing every day.

00:08:58.139 --> 00:08:58.940
But...

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.000
you know how it is, Yunqu.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.600
I barely qualified
for the Divine Sword Trial Assembly.

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:05.740
Now, I have this immortal root.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.600
If I somehow win against them,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.360
it could boost everyone's morale.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.379
Exactly!

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.559
And those moves
Xiaoying just demonstrated

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.580
show genuine improvement.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:18.779
Maybe this time,

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:21.220
we can truly humiliate
those senior disciples.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:22.240
Yes.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:23.919
Okay.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.100
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.620
But don't cause such disturbances again.

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:30.139
Practice well.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:30.700
Yes.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.059
Or the elders will come
to punish you themselves.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.860
I knew you were the best, Yunqu.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.580
We'll leave.

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:36.179
Alright.

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:36.600
Go.

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:41.299
I'm relieved you're okay, Xiaoying.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.820
You practice so hard.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.480
I won't hold you back.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.419
I'll practice even harder.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.960
Keep it up.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:49.360
You too.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.299
With your pitiful cultivation,
you want to get the Sword?

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.820
How ridiculous.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:04.779
What's worse

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.879
is that I need trash
like you to regain my body.

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:11.580
(Look at your disgusting face.)

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:13.460
(If I were stronger,)

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.419
(I'd carve you into pieces right now.)

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:20.340
To attain divine understanding,

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.659
separate one's form.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:29.000
Then one sees
their three souls and seven spirits.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.139
(I can't kill him, separate us)

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.220
(or contain him.)

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:33.759
(Bound beside me.)

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:34.740
(I can't report it.)

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.539
(I can't give up now.)

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:38.700
(I need to find a way to give a hint.)

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.100
Elder Kongming,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.860
I have a question.

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:44.700
Go ahead.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.840
I've heard souls can
separate from bodies.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.600
How long can they survive separation?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.580
Common folk die instantly
when their souls depart.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:02.980
Powerful cultivators
use soul-severing techniques

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:06.580
to move souls freely.

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:11.120
But this requires
tremendous spiritual energy.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Otherwise, they perish from exhaustion.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:19.039
(So that's how it is.)

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.360
(Ye Chenyuan's weakened cultivation)

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.299
(is to sustain his body.)

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.120
Then

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.759
what about the Night Deity?

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:32.200
If his soul separates from his body

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.440
and is bound to an immortal,

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:37.200
would he die of exhaustion?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.019
Of course he would.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.299
No matter how powerful he is,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.200
he was still banished
by the Divine Sword.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:47.200
How could he retain such power?

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:50.440
If he does this in the Nine Heavens,

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:53.879
I'll scatter his soul to the winds.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.639
But what if because of
some magical artifact...?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.519
Because of what?

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.379
Stop arguing!

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.919
Such baseless speculation is pointless.

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:05.779
Sit down.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.759
How dare you look down on me?

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.600
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.179
Three souls and seven spirits.

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:15.720
Who?

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.559
Who hit me?

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.220
You're arrogant.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.480
This is just minor punishment.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.279
Bai Xiaoying!

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.120
It's you!

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.159
Not me.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:31.799
Halt!

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.759
If not for Yunya's sake,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.799
a cleaner like you
wouldn't even be allowed here.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.159
And you remain this insolent!

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.200
Go reflect on your actions outside.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.799
(It's scorching today.)

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:55.159
(I'm adding this to his tab.)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.600
(Ye Chenyuan, don't touch me!)

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.940
You made me stay in this dull place.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.799
Of course I'd find some fun.

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:11.080
(I'll kill you.)

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.480
(Just wait. I will definitely kill you.)

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.299
Weren't you trying to kill me?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.179
You gave that old man a hint

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.159
that I'm here

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.039
by your side.

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:22.080
Too bad he's too dimwitted

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.399
to grasp your meaning.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.399
You're just reaping what you sowed.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.519
(In broad daylight,)

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.600
(you...)

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.139
No one can see me anyway.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:44.519
You treat me badly,

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.279
but I still give you energy.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.879
Shouldn't you thank me?

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.360
(Master!)

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.200
(Master!)

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.980
(Quickly undo the spell on me!)

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.159
You've been mischievous
and punished again.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.240
Since it's Elder Kongming's meaning,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.799
I can't lift this halt spell.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.240
I can't do it,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:10.799
but...

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.220
Alright.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.059
You'll feel comfortable.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:26.580
(Luckily, I have my master.)

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:29.139
(Otherwise, I couldn't go on.)

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.019
If you utter another word,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.779
I'll kill him.

00:14:37.539 --> 00:14:38.139
(Why?)

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.299
(What did Master do to you?)

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:42.460
(Or you hate to see people)

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.419
(treat me well?)

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.460
(You're serious?)

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.740
(Fine, I agree.)

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:50.340
(I'll obey you.)

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.940
(I'll do whatever you command.)

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.779
(Just don't harm him.)

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.580
So touching.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.639
If he knew you served the Night Deity,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.559
would he still treat you kindly?

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:04.460
(No matter.)

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.720
(All faults are mine.)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.039
(As long as you're happy)

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
(and forgive me,)

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.240
(I'll keep my promise.)

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:20.580
The Divine Sword
Trial Assembly is coming.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.960
The Night Deity may strike anytime.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.899
Remain vigilant.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.139
I know.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.419
I've sent disciples to monitor the moves

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.059
of the Night Clan.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.620
Okay.

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:34.600
Yunya,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.000
you're my ideal candidate
for the Sword Master.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:42.440
The trial is held for you.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.740
I will prevail through fair competition.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:47.559
I won't disappoint you.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:48.320
Okay.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.980
The prelims start tomorrow.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:54.100
Though your cultivation is pitiful now,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
in a trial like seizing immortal herbs,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.320
surprise tactics

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:00.960
ensure victory.

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.240
Seizing herbs?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.080
How do you know?

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:07.980
I'm warning you.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960
Don't try any tricks.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.080
If you fail tomorrow,

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:14.460
I will kill you

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:16.539
and your master.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.299
May I ask you

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:30.399
what surprise tactics I should use?

00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:40.940
All spells actually

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:43.460
follow the same fundamental principles.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.720
Channel natural energies

00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:47.659
and make them your own.

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:55.220
Your turn.

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:22.779
I've never seen such an idiot.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.240
Sorry about that.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.200
Though I've trained
diligently these years,

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:30.900
my cultivation remains stagnant.

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:33.859
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:51.960
Continue.

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:53.940
If you fail again,

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:56.599
don't blame my limited patience.

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:25.960
That's more like it.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.960
Worthy of my painstaking guidance.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.680
(Exactly.)

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.779
(After absorbing demonic energy,)

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.200
(my senses sharpened,)

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:38.400
(and energy gathering became easier.)

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.920
(The power flowing through me)

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:43.059
(is what I despise most.)

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:46.140
(One day,)

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:48.099
(I'll use the power you gave me)

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.279
(to kill you.)

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.339
The Trial Assembly officially begins.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.500
Compete in assigned groups.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.539
In one incense time,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.220
seize the lily of the valley
from the desk,

00:19:03.819 --> 00:19:05.220
and you'll be the victor.

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:06.839
First round.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.819
Bai Xiaoying versus Chu Qi.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.480
Xiaoying.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.200
Go, Xiaoying.

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:19.859
You can do this! I trust you.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.900
Go ahead.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.980
You really showed up.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.099
Let's see how you will
humiliate yourself later.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.799
If you lose this trial,

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:36.640
I'll kill you.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.140
You lowly cleaner

00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:40.980
didn't get enough beating last time?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.900
Back for more?

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.599
Please go easy on me.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.759
Don't count on it.

00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:11.519
This flower isn't for you.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Dumb as a hog.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.880
Stop dodging! Attack!

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:28.079
How can you retreat?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.460
You coward want to avenge your mother?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.140
Shut your mouth!

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:42.839
How could Bai Xiaoying improve so much?

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:46.880
Quit standing there!

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:47.819
Now!

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:48.980
Do it now!

00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:58.299
Bai Xiaoying

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.380
of the Yunxiu Pavilion wins.

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:01.859
You advance.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.859
- Xiaoying!
- Xiaoying!

00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:08.859
- You're amazing! You won!
- Impressive!

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:10.079
Oh, my God.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.640
- Seriously?
- How could she?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.160
She's just a lowly cleaner.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.220
It really happened.

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:17.460
Most absurd thing I've ever seen.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.140
Outrageous.

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:20.779
Performing poorly

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:22.380
yet celebrating now?

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:24.160
You're incredible.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.400
Practice harder later.

00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:27.200
You're so skilled.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.680
- We'll train harder.
- Right!

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:30.960
Yunya.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.559
During the prelims,

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:35.759
your cleaning disciple Bai Xiaoying

00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:37.819
caught my attention.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.579
She lacks immortal roots,

00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:40.819
with mediocre talent

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.980
and no past achievements.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.420
How did her cultivation
improve so suddenly?

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:50.859
Though rootless,

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:52.059
her determination

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.559
made her my disciple.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.059
After joining,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.019
while handling the chores,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.099
she studied diligently.

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:01.400
So her performance

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:02.440
didn't surprise me.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
You once said

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.279
some seemingly ordinary people

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.400
gained sudden enlightenment

00:22:08.519 --> 00:22:09.400
through cultivation

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:10.319
and then soared.

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.440
I believe this is her case.

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:14.160
I see.

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:17.599
That requires her
to properly harness this potential.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:19.559
Only then can she be used by us.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.519
Otherwise, she'll easily fall prey
to that power's backlash.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:26.740
All efforts would then be wasted.

00:22:31.839 --> 00:22:33.359
I'll teach her and lead her

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.000
onto the righteous path.

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:36.759
Very well.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.720
Bai Xiaoying.

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:03.319
Why did you come here?

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.799
If you withdraw
from the trial competition,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.559
all these will be yours.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.839
Please take them back.

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:18.920
I have no need.

00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:20.539
What do you mean?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.079
I want to kill the Night Deity.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.319
Bai Xiaoying!

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.279
Stop your glib tongue!

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.839
Don't push your luck.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.619
This is a notice,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.599
not a request.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.279
If you refuse to comply,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.880
we'll beat you into it.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.599
Have I offended you, Senior Wanyan?

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.200
Why always treat me this way?

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.099
You've mocked me repeatedly.

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:51.799
You still pretend innocence here.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:52.960
Beat her!

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.019
Disobey Senior Wanyan?

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.680
This is for your glibness!

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:05.819
Disobey Senior Wanyan?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.579
Want to avoid the beatings?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.279
Beg me for demonic energy.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.279
Though I detest you too,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.619
their noise is unbearable.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.380
(If you transfer
demonic energy to me now)

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.059
(and they discover it,)

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.740
(they'll not only
disqualify me from the trials,)

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.539
(but also might even expel me
from the Nine Heavens.)

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:24.900
(I refuse!)

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:26.180
Since you refuse,

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.220
endure it.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.980
Stop!

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:37.599
- What are you doing?
- Master.

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:38.720
- Master.
- Master.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.420
Xiaoying.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.519
Master!

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.319
Bai Xiaoying provoked us first!

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.119
They only...

00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:48.759
Let's go back.

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:54.140
Be careful.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.680
Get down.

00:24:59.119 --> 00:24:59.720
What?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.480
Xiaoying? What's wrong?

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.160
Don't make me repeat it.

00:25:07.579 --> 00:25:09.180
(I can't let him harm Master here.)

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.759
I'm fine.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.559
Be careful.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.660
Slowly.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.000
Slow down.

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:22.900
Rourou can accompany me back.

00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:24.619
Some ointment will suffice.

00:25:25.779 --> 00:25:26.339
Alright.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.859
Get some rest then.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.140
Thank you, Master.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.799
Go ahead.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.460
Here.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.339
Be careful.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.000
Xiaoying.

00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:53.480
Rest well.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.680
Okay.

00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:06.440
Know why you suffer?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.180
Your mercy makes you weak

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.279
and unfit for greatness.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.160
The greatest misfortune
I've suffered was meeting you.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.480
Still defiant.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640
With all these injuries,

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:25.319
you can't compete tomorrow.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.940
Soon, you'll beg me to heal you.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.839
Beg me.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.079
Then I'll heal you.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.440
No need for your concern.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.799
My skin's thick enough.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.319
I can't bear your demonic energy.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.920
One last chance.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.759
Beg me now,

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:55.480
and I'll comply.

00:26:56.019 --> 00:26:57.400
No need.

00:27:02.299 --> 00:27:03.619
My patience wears thin.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.180
Will you beg

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700
or not?

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.700
I've changed my mind.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.599
Skipping tomorrow's trial suits me.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.279
You'll never reclaim your body,

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.680
nor plague the mortal realm.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.140
My plans

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.700
are beyond your influence.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.599
(It hurts.)

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:40.980
(Bai Xiaoying,)

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:44.660
(you must survive to seek vengeance.)

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:49.920
Please.

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:51.680
Spare me.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.980
The way you beg for mercy

00:28:03.299 --> 00:28:05.480
is much more pleasing
than your stubborn defiance.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.299
I was ungrateful.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.940
Please forgive me.

00:28:22.579 --> 00:28:24.740
May you heal me?

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:32.799
Your staring

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:33.940
only fills me with disgust.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.660
Close your eyes.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.720
You're right.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.480
It was my lack of wisdom.
