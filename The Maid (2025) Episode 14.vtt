00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:34.093
=Episode 14=

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.400
Your Highness,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.720
everyone in the Duke's Mansion

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.800
can confirm she's Shen Yuqing.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.400
From today onward,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.280
anyone who calls her Shen Yuqing

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.400
will be killed.

00:02:12.128 --> 00:02:14.144
(The Battle of Hexi)

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.800
Master,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.960
why would the mere mention
of the Battle of Hexi

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.600
make Pei Ji believe I'm Ye Xiyan?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.920
That was both

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.560
his darkest

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.000
and brightest moment.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.160
The beginning of his rise to power.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.320
And you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720
were the witness.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000
So

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.560
the key to this plan

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.360
lies in evoking Pei Ji's hatred
toward the Empress Dowager

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.640
and his desire to save a helpless woman
who lost everything.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.400
This plan

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.640
must be used when your life's at stake.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.600
But that's also
when you'll be most vulnerable.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.920
His rescue

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.280
will make you dependent on him.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.880
Remember this.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.960
Detachment is the most captivating.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.240
Never

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.480
fall for that man.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.280
Dare to target me?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.528
Good thing I was prepared.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.240
No.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.320
I earned these through blood.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680
I risked my life!

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.920
Discarding allies after use.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.240
Aren't you afraid you'll be...

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.560
Treating wooden beads as treasures?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.240
Watching you distrust each other

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.160
and destroy yourselves

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.040
makes my time

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.800
in Yangque Garden worthwhile.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.760
Pity we couldn't extract

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.480
Madam Su's secrets from him.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.480
My lady,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.000
what's this?

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.840
Mani Pearl,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.600
Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's
ritual implement.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.960
Few worship

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.640
Ksitigarbha at home.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.600
Yet there's a statue of Ksitigarbha

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.040
in the Duke's Mansion's chapel.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.425
(Qin Xiaoniang)

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:42.688
(Li Si)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.760
(Outside Duke's Mansion)

00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:56.160
(Yuran, Daughter of Duke's concubine)

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.480
Lady Yuran,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.480
Lady Xiyan

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.880
plans to confront the Duchess.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280
My lady.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.200
I've lived over fifty years

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.320
and never seen ghosts.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.280
Yet you all claim

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.840
to have witnessed ghosts.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.640
My kind aunt

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.200
raised me within these walls.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.280
My smiling aunt

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.280
watched as Yuanjin
trampled an orphan like me.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.080
My trembling aunt now fears

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.320
restless spirits

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.520
demanding justice.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.600
Ghosts fear fire.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.480
Guards.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.840
Loose arrows!

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.320
Light fires and shoot!

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.920
Just cheap tricks.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.000
Whether played by human or ghost,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.280
won't cause chaos in this mansion.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.680
My kind aunt

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.560
raised me within these walls.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.262
My smiling aunt

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:29.696
watched as Yuanjin
trampled an orphan like me.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.600
My trembling aunt now fears

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.440
restless spirits demanding justice.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.520
My lady,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.760
what should we do?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.840
Stay calm.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.760
Keep shooting!

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.720
Demanding justice...

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.600
My kind aunt

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.080
raised me within these walls.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.360
Loose!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:07:59.920
My lady!

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.200
Escort her inside.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.400
Quickly!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.080
It's the first time

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.360
I've seen her so panicked.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.440
Yuran,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.000
is Lady Xiyan really not our Qing?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.840
She bested Shen Yuanjin
at the ladies' banquet

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.760
and escaped Yangque Garden unscathed.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.840
Yuxiang,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.720
as long as she helps
overthrow the Duchess,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.120
her identity doesn't matter.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.400
Mother,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.680
Lin Jifu's ghost is haunting us.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.800
The rumors are spreading.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.000
What are we going to do now?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.880
Where's the bearing

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.720
of the Princess Consort in you now?

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.200
If you hadn't stooped so low

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.520
to commit adultery with a guard,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.040
how could you be in this predicament?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.640
Is this the time
to dredge up past grievances?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.320
You...

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.200
I've ordered this matter sealed.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.640
As long as it doesn't reach the palace,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.800
what does it matter

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.360
even if the whole world knows?

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.520
I wasted all my efforts on you.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.120
You're not even half as good
as Shen Yuqing.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.760
Copy the Sutra a hundred times.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.120
Let it temper your disposition.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.080
People from the Duke's Mansion

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.920
are arresting those
spreading the ballad.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.840
It might not reach the Empress Dowager.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.640
It's fine.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.320
I have ways
to inform the Empress Dowager.

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:47.577
(Imperial City Gate)

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.864
(My kind aunt)

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.000
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.680
Didn't the physician diagnose a chill?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.880
Why do you look so haggard?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.120
It's nothing.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.280
I've troubled you needlessly.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.800
Wouldn't want to infect you.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.560
After recovery,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.440
I'll visit to keep you company.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.920
Today, I came

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.000
for something else.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.640
Fu couldn't be raised under my care,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.480
nor did I bid her farewell.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.800
The rumors say

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.640
her resentful spirit lingers.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.080
Doubtlessly,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.280
she resents me.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.440
Today, I came

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.880
to see for myself.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.680
Your Grace,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.240
these are baseless claims.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.040
Pay them no heed.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.160
Your Grace,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.200
after Jifu's death,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.640
mother and I wept daily.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.240
This is clearly sabotage
through Fu's death.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.600
Your care for Fu

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.040
was evident to me.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
Yet sleepless nights compel me

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.760
to verify

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.560
whether it is treachery

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.520
or lingering resentment?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.160
This will help you

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.040
find closure.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.600
Search!

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.040
Leave no corner unchecked!

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.640
- Understood!
- Understood!

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.120
Your Grace,

00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:55.680
the entire mansion is searched.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.800
Nothing was found.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.240
The ballad says

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.520
"Burn incense, bow,
and keep what's beneath".

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.880
What does this mean?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.880
Why trust obvious lies?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.960
Open the shrine.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.280
Why hoard scriptures?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.760
Fu

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.760
was my life's work.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.880
I nurtured her

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.480
with great efforts.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.150
How could I not grieve?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.000
I copied sutras

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.600
every night.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.440
They soothe a mother's heart.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800
Her departure was too sudden.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.320
I let grief cloud my judgment.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.200
Ye Xiyan, Prince Regent's
noble concubine, requests audience.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.160
Why's she here?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.000
Admit her.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.760
Understood.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.960
Long live the Empress Dowager.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.000
I've recovered
the Duke's Mansion's lost treasure

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.880
and come to return it.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.640
We've lost nothing.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.840
Where is the pearl

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.680
in the Ksitigarbha's left-hand?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.640
No wonder the mansion

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.760
is plagued by hauntings.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.320
Ksitigarbha governs reincarnation.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.680
Could this

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.360
