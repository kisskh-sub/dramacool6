01:32.417 --> 01:35.909
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

01:37.875 --> 01:39.160
Anyone?

01:39.542 --> 01:41.498
"Was" means it has passed.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.664
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.537
But the difference is that "used to be"

01:46.792 --> 01:48.908
carries a sense of loss.

01:49.750 --> 01:50.990
Does everybody understand?

01:51.750 --> 01:53.456
Let's go over the tenses again.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.740
One, one, two, one!

02:51.125 --> 02:52.365
Score above 600!

02:52.542 --> 02:53.893
- Score above 600!
- Score above 600!

02:53.917 --> 02:56.893
- Get into the university of your dreams!
- Get into the university of your dreams!

02:56.917 --> 02:58.123
- Never quit!
- Never quit!

02:58.208 --> 02:59.488
- Never give up!
- Never give up!

02:59.542 --> 03:01.157
- Keep calm!
- Keep calm!

Academic excellence award
advanced class

03:31.500 --> 03:34.947
Countdown to national college
entrance exam: 60 days

04:02.500 --> 04:05.947
Grade twelve, science, class ten

04:55.750 --> 04:58.207
- Did she jump off the building?
- Is it her?

05:23.333 --> 05:24.493
Really? Why?

05:27.167 --> 05:29.328
Really?

05:37.875 --> 05:39.035
Stop taking photos!

05:39.583 --> 05:40.447
Put your phones away!

05:40.542 --> 05:41.952
Everyone, back to your classrooms!

05:47.708 --> 05:48.708
Okay

06:23.125 --> 06:24.285
Too much pressure?

06:27.292 --> 06:28.292
What happened?

06:35.333 --> 06:37.415
Self-discipline,
work hard, no regrets

06:43.583 --> 06:44.698
Why?

06:44.792 --> 06:45.998
Why else?

07:12.542 --> 07:16.615
Snooze for 5 minutes

07:47.958 --> 07:49.914
Grade 12

07:54.917 --> 07:56.248
Is chen nian here?

07:56.958 --> 07:57.958
Chen nian.

07:58.292 --> 07:59.372
The teacher asked for you.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.073
Relax.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.119
We just need to ask you a few questions.

08:07.583 --> 08:08.914
Did hu xiaodie

08:09.000 --> 08:10.490
say anything to you the day she died?

08:12.750 --> 08:13.956
Nothing.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.164
Are you sure?

08:17.750 --> 08:18.785
Take your time.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.410
Think about it.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.208
I heard you're taking
the college entrance exam this year.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.934
You enrolled in a remedial course

08:29.958 --> 08:31.698
to get into
a prestigious university, right?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.116
Her old school
wasn't academically up to par.

08:38.875 --> 08:42.868
Did hu xiaodie have
any close friends in school?

08:45.750 --> 08:47.411
Friends aren't necessary here.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.200
Do you mean you or her?

08:51.792 --> 08:52.827
Just me.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.365
I don't know about other people.

08:55.417 --> 08:56.998
Suicide is a serious matter.

08:57.417 --> 09:00.784
Did she appear emotionally disturbed
to you?

09:01.042 --> 09:02.998
Or did something happen to her?

09:04.667 --> 09:05.667
Chen nian.

09:06.292 --> 09:08.499
If you know something, tell us.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.574
The school board is highly concerned
about campus safety now.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.657
The school and teachers will protect you.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.125
Don't be afraid.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.581
Why did you do it?

09:22.208 --> 09:23.789
You said you barely knew her.

09:34.583 --> 09:35.698
It's time for class.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.662
They can't spare more time.
The exams are approaching.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.617
We need your cooperation
in this investigation.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.743
Hu xiaodie...

09:50.875 --> 09:52.866
Probably wouldn't want

09:53.167 --> 09:54.828
to be seen like that.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.990
Didn't you hear the bell?

11:15.958 --> 11:17.118
Rise.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.083
Salute.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.367
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.

11:23.875 --> 11:24.875
Sit.

11:27.542 --> 11:28.542
What's wrong?

11:32.750 --> 11:33.830
Who did this?

11:36.292 --> 11:37.577
The exam is almost here!

11:37.667 --> 11:38.827
There is no time for pranks!

11:41.375 --> 11:44.117
Also, try to get along
with your classmates.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.995
If you are being bullied,
you must tell me.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.364
Okay?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.414
- Hello, sir.
- Hold on.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.331
- Okay.
- I'll deal with your child later.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.414
I am your teacher.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.866
I care about your grades
as well as your life.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.160
Is your mom home yet?

12:03.333 --> 12:04.413
No.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.373
Okay, go back to class.

12:09.417 --> 12:12.033
Peking university,
tsinghua university

12:17.250 --> 12:20.617
The child will have her exam soon.
Someone must be home.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.369
- Zhou lei!
- I know you're in there!

12:36.458 --> 12:38.744
Stop hiding! Open the door!

12:38.917 --> 12:40.953
I know you're inside! Open up!

12:41.042 --> 12:41.872
Zhou lei!

12:41.958 --> 12:43.414
Open the door!

12:43.500 --> 12:46.867
- Zhou lei!
- Pay us back!

13:07.375 --> 13:09.115
Want stewed pork dumplings?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.991
What? Stewed pork dumplings?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.789
Stop pushing me.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.581
Chen nian is over there.

13:19.292 --> 13:20.657
Let's go over to her.

13:23.583 --> 13:25.539
Hi. We're coming in.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.953
Your ranking went up again this week.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.250
What?

13:35.542 --> 13:37.908
How did you manage to do so well?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.036
Want to join our study group?

13:42.542 --> 13:43.748
Why not?

13:43.833 --> 13:46.745
I want to ask you a few english questions.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.618
I don't have time.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.664
No time? Really?

13:50.750 --> 13:52.615
She just doesn't want
to waste time on you.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.948
Nonsense.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.657
Chen nian is not so petty.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.081
She's a nice person

13:57.167 --> 13:59.203
and she's good to her classmates.

13:59.542 --> 14:00.998
Isn't that right, chen nian?

14:01.958 --> 14:03.664
Let me take your picture.

14:14.417 --> 14:15.497
Chen nian!

14:40.375 --> 14:42.206
Hey, are you okay?

14:44.792 --> 14:45.656
Don't worry.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.456
We just want to show our appreciation.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.749
When you covered up xiaodie's body
the other day,

14:49.833 --> 14:51.573
I was so touched.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.948
But when you talked to the police,

14:57.042 --> 14:58.782
I wasn't so touched anymore.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.289
So what did you tell them?

15:26.042 --> 15:28.408
Mom, I've told you before.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.476
Don't open the curtains.
The creditors will show up.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.456
Where were you? You're back so late.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.250
Hey.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.744
Where did you find this?

15:38.375 --> 15:41.788
- I've been searching for it all day.
- Isn't the mask contraband?

15:42.167 --> 15:45.284
It won't perform miracles,
but it won't kill you.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.331
What actually happened?

15:49.417 --> 15:51.908
- Let's listen to the interviews.
- Mom!

15:52.750 --> 15:54.832
When the emergency...

16:01.167 --> 16:02.998
Delivery order

16:04.042 --> 16:05.157
are there a lot?

16:07.625 --> 16:08.660
Not really.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.995
So this is how hair turns grey overnight.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.324
Yet, you keep selling illegal goods.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.039
I'm a victim too.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.574
The area I picked isn't bad.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.490
When I get my cut,

16:24.583 --> 16:26.574
you'll get your college tuition.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.660
How are your studies?

16:29.125 --> 16:30.125
Good.

16:30.542 --> 16:32.422
My test scores this month
are among the top ten.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.831
I know I'm not a good mom.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.748
Be patient.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.912
Once you graduate from college,
we'll escape this hellhole.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.448
I know I owe you.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.289
Boys, help the girls.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.330
I don't know why you're laughing.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.698
I do hope you'll be happy
after the college entrance exam.

17:26.666 --> 17:27.577
Let me tell you.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.627
Being placed in the last row doesn't
determine your future social position,

17:31.583 --> 17:33.494
but you will have a hard life.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.120
If you want an easier life,
you better start working hard now.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.574
Some of you have scored consistently well,

17:39.792 --> 17:40.872
so they deserve praise.

17:40.958 --> 17:42.823
Wei lai, keep it up.

17:42.917 --> 17:43.997
Thank you, sir.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.289
Luo jun.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.494
I worry I'll be seeing you again
next year.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.874
- Now!
- Mess him up!

18:03.958 --> 18:06.244
- Come on!
- How dare you beat up my brother?

18:06.333 --> 18:08.665
You're telling me to go to hell?
You can go first!

18:08.750 --> 18:09.750
Bottle!

18:12.500 --> 18:13.410
Bastard!

18:13.500 --> 18:14.410
Get up!

18:14.500 --> 18:15.785
Weren't you so tough?

18:17.125 --> 18:19.491
Someone's getting beaten up by a gang...

18:20.042 --> 18:21.452
Come here!

18:25.917 --> 18:28.158
Hey, she called the police.

18:32.792 --> 18:33.792
Is he your boyfriend?

18:33.833 --> 18:35.289
Speak the hell up!

18:35.375 --> 18:36.956
- Speak up!
- No.

18:37.042 --> 18:38.657
Then why did you call the police?

18:38.750 --> 18:39.990
Crazy bitch!

18:41.250 --> 18:43.411
Give me your bag!

18:48.083 --> 18:49.198
Fifty yuan?

18:49.667 --> 18:50.747
Give me your phone.

18:51.167 --> 18:53.783
- I said, give me your phone!
- Hey!

18:55.208 --> 18:56.823
She's just a girl.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.456
I get it now.

19:00.542 --> 19:01.542
Get him.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.910
This bitch likes him.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.412
She has a crush on him and wants to help.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.286
Make her kiss this mad dog!

19:07.375 --> 19:08.581
Kiss him!

19:08.667 --> 19:09.952
Kiss him!

19:10.042 --> 19:11.828
- Do it!
- Hurry up!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.873
- Are you deaf?
- I'm letting you kiss him.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.916
- Didn't you hear me?
- Do you have a death wish?

19:18.083 --> 19:19.323
Hurry and kiss him!

19:19.458 --> 19:20.538
Kiss him!

19:20.750 --> 19:22.160
Do you want him to die?

19:22.583 --> 19:23.868
Still won't kiss him?

19:24.542 --> 19:25.827
Do it!

19:35.542 --> 19:36.542
She really did it!

19:36.583 --> 19:37.743
She kissed him!

19:38.167 --> 19:40.032
How dare you mess with my brother?

19:40.583 --> 19:42.619
- They kissed!
- Who are you?

19:49.292 --> 19:50.292
Brother!

19:50.417 --> 19:51.623
Brother, are you all right?

19:55.417 --> 19:57.032
This is not over!

21:06.708 --> 21:07.948
How much did they take?

21:10.083 --> 21:11.914
- Answer me.
- Fifty yuan.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.865
I don't have any change.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.250
Beishan!

21:23.042 --> 21:24.042
Give me your phone.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.539
I thought we're here for change.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.285
You have to buy something first.

21:29.375 --> 21:33.869
Mobile phone repair

21:36.500 --> 21:38.707
this will cost 200 yuan.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.331
- What?
- I'm not scamming you.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.533
It needs major repairs.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.490
The parts alone cost 150 yuan.

21:49.167 --> 21:50.167
Okay.

21:50.583 --> 21:51.583
Give me 50 yuan back.

21:51.917 --> 21:52.917
Fine.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.657
You're so cheap.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.390
If you don't want to pay the service fee,

21:56.625 --> 21:57.990
you can fix it yourself.

22:20.042 --> 22:22.909
- You can fix phones?
- I deal in stolen phone parts.

22:30.375 --> 22:31.956
You had it repaired before?

22:37.667 --> 22:39.307
Most of the original parts were replaced.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.831
You didn't watch the repair?

22:41.333 --> 22:42.693
They probably stole your data too.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.832
I don't have any important data.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.327
Fool.

22:49.417 --> 22:50.907
You're a perfect target.

22:52.792 --> 22:53.998
Look.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.081
If you pay me,

22:57.167 --> 22:58.498
I can protect you.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.539
You can't even protect yourself.

23:00.625 --> 23:01.785
How can you protect me?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.831
Getting beat up is nothing.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.369
I always get even in the end.

23:11.667 --> 23:12.907
Carry on fighting.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.290
I'm going to the best university
in the country,

23:15.542 --> 23:16.873
unlike you.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.660
How are we different?

23:24.125 --> 23:25.581
Don't you see?

23:26.417 --> 23:27.907
Either you bully others

23:28.542 --> 23:29.952
or you get bullied.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.539
So which kind are you?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.748
Is your house to the left or right?

23:53.667 --> 23:55.498
You don't have to escort me.

24:16.625 --> 24:17.831
What's your name?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.199
You can't tell me even
after we've kissed?

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
Hey!

24:35.042 --> 24:37.624
Police

24:37.792 --> 24:38.998
pull down your hood.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.331
- How did you get hurt?
- Is it a crime?

24:46.417 --> 24:47.702
Just answer the question.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.202
Show me your ID.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.740
Liar exposed!
Don't trust this crook

25:48.750 --> 25:49.865
Wow, look at this!

25:49.958 --> 25:52.415
"Your daughter is still in school.â

25:52.500 --> 25:56.197
"It won't look good
if we take it to court."

26:14.833 --> 26:16.243
Liar exposed!
Don't trust this crook

26:34.500 --> 26:35.410
Chen nian!

26:35.500 --> 26:37.393
Liu yiping from class 5
wants to buy a facial mask!

26:37.417 --> 26:39.703
Shut up! Enough already!

26:43.375 --> 26:45.582
The smart always find ways

26:45.667 --> 26:47.703
the foolish trap themselves

27:09.667 --> 27:11.623
- Where to?
- Wherever.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.250
Sit.

28:34.583 --> 28:35.618
Shut the door.

29:08.125 --> 29:10.457
I have money to help you
and your mom

29:19.500 --> 29:20.980
Are you fighting with your boyfriend?

29:29.333 --> 29:30.743
Why come here if you have one?

29:31.167 --> 29:32.167
Power off

29:41.125 --> 29:43.286
- Do you like me?
- What is there to like?

29:55.042 --> 29:56.703
I never even considered it.

29:59.375 --> 30:00.956
Then why follow me home?

30:02.833 --> 30:04.824
I didn't expect you to bring me here.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.161
Is my place too shabby for you?

30:13.917 --> 30:15.123
Don't worry.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.643
I don't intend to sleep with you.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.453
Then why bring it up?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.032
I did consider it though.

30:22.417 --> 30:23.998
Are you sure you want to continue?

30:24.083 --> 30:25.163
I'm just making small talk.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.290
Did anybody ever teach you manners?

30:48.708 --> 30:49.914
Are you scared now?

30:51.792 --> 30:53.453
I'm just a punk.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.539
Why should I bother with manners?

32:00.042 --> 32:01.202
Class is over.

32:01.292 --> 32:02.782
You can go and study if you wish.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.490
Put the balls back when you leave.

32:09.792 --> 32:10.998
My mom said,

32:11.083 --> 32:12.869
"like mom, like daughter.

32:12.958 --> 32:14.619
Like a chip off the old block."

32:14.708 --> 32:16.809
You must be exhausted
from paying off your mom's debt.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.619
How can you even play today?

32:28.375 --> 32:29.956
Are you done?

32:50.958 --> 32:51.788
Chen nian.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.615
- Chen nian.
- Chen nian.

32:54.167 --> 32:55.202
Are you all right?

32:55.292 --> 32:56.643
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

32:56.667 --> 32:57.702
Are you okay?

33:09.500 --> 33:11.365
Be careful
when using the stairs next time.

33:12.042 --> 33:13.452
Keep your wound dry.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
You're good to go.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.077
Just one more month

33:33.167 --> 33:34.782
and we can go to Beijing.

33:35.958 --> 33:37.744
What if I can't hold out?

33:38.458 --> 33:40.073
Like hu xiaodie?

33:42.917 --> 33:44.248
She was weak.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.749
She let those people affect her.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.243
She wasn't the only weak one.

33:50.667 --> 33:53.283
Both of us are weak too.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.164
They've been bullying me all along.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.373
Why didn't any of you do anything?

34:34.333 --> 34:36.244
Hello, officer zheng?

34:47.333 --> 34:48.333
That's absurd.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.032
I don't even remember it.

34:51.542 --> 34:53.032
I'm afraid of ghosts.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.114
Hu xiaodie was a slut.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.910
Everyone hated her.

34:59.167 --> 35:00.167
Why single us out?

35:00.250 --> 35:01.330
What about chen nian?

35:01.792 --> 35:03.498
Didn't you push her down the stairs?

35:04.500 --> 35:06.707
Tell me how you bullied her.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.453
You believe her?

35:08.625 --> 35:09.910
I know nothing.

35:10.083 --> 35:11.698
We're good friends with chen nian.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.283
We play pranks on
each other all the time.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.581
- Just now...
- Pranks?

35:17.750 --> 35:20.947
So what prank did you play
that pushed hu xiaodie to suicide?

35:21.292 --> 35:22.372
Do you have any proof?

35:22.458 --> 35:24.369
Would you be here if I didn't?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.407
It was her choice to kill herself.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.036
I had nothing to do with it.

35:31.458 --> 35:33.039
She didn't want to repeat the course.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.476
Her mom forced her to take lessons.
Her grades were terrible.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.242
The teacher said third-tier
colleges were her best hope.

35:38.833 --> 35:40.789
Maybe she was under
too much pressure.

35:41.042 --> 35:43.283
Don't you feel even a
tiny bit of remorse?

35:46.875 --> 35:48.081
Who's calling me?

35:48.417 --> 35:49.623
Your mom.

35:50.208 --> 35:53.120
Your parents should see you now.

35:53.375 --> 35:54.375
Answer it.

35:57.917 --> 35:59.327
If you've already told them,

35:59.750 --> 36:01.786
why ask me all this bullshit?

36:02.542 --> 36:04.248
I didn't do anything.

36:04.458 --> 36:05.743
Even if my mom comes,

36:05.833 --> 36:07.949
I won't give them a penny.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.533
Maybe it's good that hu xiaodie died.

36:12.625 --> 36:15.287
How else would her mom get
such a big payout?

36:15.375 --> 36:18.208
If she sues,
she might even get a half million!

36:18.417 --> 36:21.124
Even if she didn't die
and went to college.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.450
It would've taken her years
to earn that much.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.616
There's something I want to tell you.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.624
School bullying cases are rather tricky.

37:09.833 --> 37:13.325
You can't file charges
without concrete evidence.

37:13.792 --> 37:17.034
In the end, the ministry of education
always intervenes.

37:17.375 --> 37:18.911
More witnesses will come forward.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.161
Why did you bully others
when you were young?

37:21.292 --> 37:22.532
I didn't.

37:22.917 --> 37:24.953
Then you were bullied.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.414
I don't smoke.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.828
Empathy only comes with age.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.908
You just tend to forget
your wrongdoings.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.743
We weren't nearly as bad as
they are now.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.206
It's quite common now.

37:39.417 --> 37:40.827
Not long ago,

37:41.083 --> 37:42.539
a group of senior high students

37:42.625 --> 37:45.662
beat a classmate to death.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.573
When I took their statements,

37:47.917 --> 37:50.124
none of them thought

37:50.458 --> 37:52.790
that a person could be
beaten to death.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.413
Just because these cases
happen on campus,

37:57.917 --> 38:00.499
doesn't mean it
doesn't spread off-campus.

38:01.458 --> 38:02.948
If you try talking to the principal,

38:03.042 --> 38:05.078
he'll pass it on to the teachers

38:05.167 --> 38:08.159
who will then pass it
on to the parents.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.616
Then the parent will say,
"I work in shenzhen.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.790
I only see my kid once a year."

38:13.042 --> 38:14.498
Who else is left?

38:18.208 --> 38:19.914
No matter what, we are the police.

38:20.917 --> 38:22.828
We must try our best to help.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.740
Please give her another chance.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.036
I'm begging you.

38:32.750 --> 38:35.207
- I'll kneel!
- Mom!

38:35.292 --> 38:37.533
Xiaomiao, come and kneel!

38:37.625 --> 38:39.331
- Don't kneel!
- Beg your teacher! Beg him!

38:39.417 --> 38:41.328
- Plead to the teacher.
- Please get up.

38:41.417 --> 38:43.101
- Please reinvestigate!
- What are you doing?

38:43.125 --> 38:45.161
- Please reinvestigate!
- Get off me!

38:45.250 --> 38:46.410
Don't get physical!

38:46.500 --> 38:48.411
This is a school! Behave yourself!

38:48.667 --> 38:50.027
- Get back inside.
- Please get up.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.074
- Please help us.
- Get up.

38:52.167 --> 38:53.623
It's all your fault!

38:53.708 --> 38:55.148
- Who are you? Stop!
- Don't stop me!

38:55.208 --> 38:56.664
Call security!

38:57.000 --> 38:58.285
Why can't you study?

38:58.375 --> 38:59.865
Don't! Stop!

38:59.958 --> 39:01.573
You have no right to do that!

39:01.667 --> 39:03.203
Is this how you parent your child?

39:03.292 --> 39:04.532
This is ridiculous!

39:04.625 --> 39:06.707
They've all been suspended.

39:07.917 --> 39:10.875
But they'll still attend
the college entrance exam.

39:13.333 --> 39:14.539
They're still young.

39:15.167 --> 39:17.203
We want to give them a second chance.

39:18.917 --> 39:20.248
Try to get past this.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.743
Don't let this distract you.

39:27.667 --> 39:28.873
Chen nian.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.827
You did the right thing.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.206
Trust that you did the right thing.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.998
There will always be
shadows on the path,

39:40.292 --> 39:42.499
but when you look up,
you will always see the light.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.533
I'm responsible for all of this too.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.331
You'll get a new homeroom teacher.

40:05.375 --> 40:06.581
Chen nian!

40:23.833 --> 40:25.744
Are you disappointed in me?

40:28.917 --> 40:30.248
I'm disappointed too.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.740
But who can I blame?

40:33.208 --> 40:37.372
- We did the best we could...
- But you know the truth, right?

40:51.375 --> 40:52.911
Up until I was 18 years old,

40:53.000 --> 40:54.536
I didn't like to sleep.

40:55.375 --> 40:57.036
My high school teacher told me

40:57.125 --> 40:59.537
to try for the police academy
or a medical school.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.207
Both professions require
working at night.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.783
I did what she said
and became a cop.

41:04.875 --> 41:05.910
I gradually

41:06.625 --> 41:08.536
came to appreciate sleep.

41:08.667 --> 41:09.998
Do you know why?

41:13.750 --> 41:16.162
There are people and things
I would rather not see.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.332
We're not that kind of family.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.703
Her dad and I always teach her

41:20.875 --> 41:23.833
principles and moral values.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.911
What kind of people to befriend

41:26.000 --> 41:27.080
and how to befriend others.

41:27.167 --> 41:28.532
They're essential social skills.

41:29.208 --> 41:31.048
There are things
other kids don't even consider

41:31.500 --> 41:33.161
that she needs to consider

41:33.250 --> 41:34.956
because she's special.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.991
Things aren't always what they seem.

41:39.083 --> 41:40.163
For instance,

41:40.250 --> 41:41.684
what's the background of the parents?

41:41.708 --> 41:44.290
Why was the child emotionally disturbed?

41:44.375 --> 41:46.491
Shouldn't the school take responsibility?

41:46.583 --> 41:49.199
Moreover, everything requires proof.

41:49.292 --> 41:52.489
Should we get to the bottom of it,
things will turn ugly.

41:53.250 --> 41:55.457
Have you ever seen
the eyes of wild animals

41:56.542 --> 41:58.373
just before they're killed?

41:58.958 --> 42:00.494
My child is still young and naive.

42:00.667 --> 42:03.158
It's hard to say
who the innocent one is here.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.911
They have no expression.

42:05.583 --> 42:06.948
None at all.

42:09.417 --> 42:11.328
It's because they're afraid.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.908
You can see it in their eyes.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.953
You don't need to be
afraid anymore.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.490
Concentrate on the
college entrance exam.

42:21.625 --> 42:22.625
Right.

42:22.875 --> 42:25.617
Once the exam is over,
we become adults.

42:29.708 --> 42:30.823
My mom said

42:30.917 --> 42:32.748
that the advantage
of getting older is that

42:32.833 --> 42:34.323
you begin to forget things.

42:35.750 --> 42:38.207
Don't let anything affect you.

42:38.417 --> 42:39.827
You forget it all in the end.

42:41.250 --> 42:44.742
However, what they don't teach you is

42:45.000 --> 42:46.706
how to be an adult.

42:55.958 --> 42:56.958
Chen nian,

42:57.375 --> 42:58.660
listen to me.

42:59.250 --> 43:00.786
Growing up is like diving.

43:02.042 --> 43:04.658
Don't think.
Just close your eyes and jump in.

43:05.167 --> 43:08.159
There will be sand, rocks, and clams
in the river.

43:10.250 --> 43:12.161
That's how we all grow up.

43:22.750 --> 43:25.082
Nian, are you home?

43:26.042 --> 43:27.373
Have you eaten?

43:31.083 --> 43:32.083
Yes.

43:33.292 --> 43:35.408
I ran into some trouble.

43:35.875 --> 43:37.991
Some people had allergic reactions
to the masks.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.831
They make a scene here every day.

43:45.458 --> 43:46.493
Hello?

43:48.208 --> 43:50.665
Then come home. Just quit.

43:50.750 --> 43:52.911
I can't make money back home.

43:53.167 --> 43:54.782
Not to mention the creditors.

43:55.042 --> 43:57.784
You're safer at home without me.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.206
You're a child.

43:59.292 --> 44:00.623
They won't do anything to you.

44:05.417 --> 44:06.417
Hello?

44:09.292 --> 44:12.034
Do you have enough money?

44:12.625 --> 44:13.910
Yes, I do.

44:14.583 --> 44:16.164
Doesn't the mask give you a rash?

44:16.250 --> 44:18.161
I can't let it go to waste.

44:18.250 --> 44:20.081
Don't blame me if anything happens.

44:20.167 --> 44:21.407
I won't.

44:21.583 --> 44:23.915
You want one? Buy it yourself.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.582
Once I make it to Beijing,
everything will be fine.

44:27.167 --> 44:30.614
Let's open a small shop
in front of the university.

44:31.167 --> 44:33.374
I'll bring students to our store.

44:33.583 --> 44:36.245
Let's make money off my classmates.

44:38.667 --> 44:40.703
All right. That's my girl.

44:41.125 --> 44:42.990
I know I can count on you.

44:43.750 --> 44:46.287
Listen, you're amazing.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.911
So am I.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.934
We're reincarnations of the monkey king.

44:49.958 --> 44:51.323
We're both undefeatable.

44:56.333 --> 44:57.948
It's nearly dawn.

44:58.667 --> 45:00.498
Don't screw up now.

45:00.583 --> 45:01.914
Okay?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.365
I heard you.

45:03.458 --> 45:04.698
Trust me.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.831
- Keep it up.
- Sure.

45:11.792 --> 45:12.827
I'm hanging up.

45:12.917 --> 45:14.373
Sleep early.

45:17.208 --> 45:18.573
I'm hanging up for real.

45:37.208 --> 45:40.530
We should all stand up against bullying.

45:40.625 --> 45:43.458
If anyone should seek help,

45:43.542 --> 45:45.749
the school will take the matter
seriously!

45:45.833 --> 45:47.915
Countdown to national college
entrance exam: 43 days

45:48.083 --> 45:50.074
the entrance exam is very stressful,

45:50.083 --> 45:52.699
but the students' well-being
is our priority.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.999
The school will strengthen
its counseling service.

45:55.083 --> 45:58.325
Please approach the counselor
if you have any questions.

45:58.417 --> 46:00.203
We must persist!

46:00.708 --> 46:02.790
It's you against the world!

46:03.125 --> 46:06.447
Only if you can stand your ground,
will you prevail!

46:06.667 --> 46:08.623
We are not afraid, right?

46:08.708 --> 46:10.448
- Yes.
- Yes.

46:11.625 --> 46:12.625
Class dismissed.

46:16.958 --> 46:18.869
What kind of replacement is he?

46:18.958 --> 46:20.994
He's horrible.

46:26.667 --> 46:29.454
Students, you'll be graduating soon!

46:29.958 --> 46:33.325
You're entering
the first stage of your life.

46:33.417 --> 46:34.452
Are you happy?

46:34.542 --> 46:36.908
- Yes!
- Yes!

46:37.000 --> 46:38.285
Let's take a picture!

46:39.875 --> 46:41.081
You're graduating!

46:41.167 --> 46:42.202
Smile!

46:42.292 --> 46:43.372
- Smile!
- Look here!

46:43.458 --> 46:45.744
Three, two, one, say cheese!

46:45.833 --> 46:48.324
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

47:25.292 --> 47:26.873
You dared to call the cops.

47:27.167 --> 47:29.374
Why don't you follow in
hu xiaodie's footsteps?

47:30.250 --> 47:31.250
Diel

47:35.417 --> 47:37.908
chen nian,
why are you in such a hurry to die?

47:52.167 --> 47:53.828
Why are you running?

47:56.667 --> 47:57.952
Where are you going?

47:58.042 --> 47:59.157
Stop running!

47:59.250 --> 48:00.865
You think you can escape?

48:01.833 --> 48:02.833
Stop!

48:04.167 --> 48:05.167
Stop running!

48:14.667 --> 48:16.032
Stop running!

48:21.792 --> 48:23.453
That way!

48:54.292 --> 48:55.532
Did you see her?

48:59.083 --> 49:00.083
Go to her house!

49:00.125 --> 49:01.706
She'll go home eventually.

49:22.167 --> 49:24.874
Officer zheng

49:26.208 --> 49:28.018
I couldn't take your call
during interrogation.

49:28.042 --> 49:29.657
What's the matter?

49:30.125 --> 49:32.161
Zheng yi, he's talking. Come back in.

49:35.875 --> 49:37.035
Chen nian?

49:37.458 --> 49:39.198
I'm sorry, I misdialed.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.865
Can you protect me?

51:03.833 --> 51:05.619
I don't have money to pay you.

51:07.875 --> 51:09.706
But I must go to Beijing.

51:23.583 --> 51:24.663
Don't move.

52:02.458 --> 52:03.538
Do you feel hot?

52:06.875 --> 52:07.990
What did you say?

52:09.500 --> 52:10.956
Do you feel hot?

52:14.917 --> 52:16.123
No.

52:19.375 --> 52:20.956
Is it hard?

52:22.500 --> 52:23.535
What?

52:24.250 --> 52:27.083
Is the couch hard?

52:31.625 --> 52:32.865
No.

52:45.833 --> 52:47.824
Didn't you look down on me?

53:11.042 --> 53:12.327
Give me your notebook.

53:12.875 --> 53:13.875
What?

53:14.375 --> 53:15.956
Give me your notebook.

53:21.417 --> 53:23.123
Bring a pen too.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.993
Write here.

53:32.083 --> 53:33.789
Chen nian owes beishan one.

53:39.583 --> 53:41.073
I haven't specified what it is.

53:41.417 --> 53:42.782
Maybe it's just a meal.

53:49.958 --> 53:52.495
Chen nian owes
beishan one for...

53:55.333 --> 53:56.664
Maybe not a meal.

53:57.250 --> 53:58.615
It could be something else.

54:03.750 --> 54:05.240
You have to get up early.

55:39.208 --> 55:40.208
Hey.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.038
Don't touch chen nian.

56:12.667 --> 56:13.827
Watch him.

56:17.667 --> 56:18.747
Where's the money?

56:27.208 --> 56:28.539
What are you looking at?

56:28.625 --> 56:30.616
You have some guts coming here!

56:33.792 --> 56:35.657
Pay up for the last job.

56:37.583 --> 56:41.622
Grade 12 students, raise your right hand

56:41.708 --> 56:43.164
and take the oath!

56:44.417 --> 56:45.657
I vow...

56:45.833 --> 56:47.448
= " vow...â " I vow...

56:47.542 --> 56:49.908
- I will not fail my parents!
- I will not fail my parents!

56:50.000 --> 56:51.911
I will not disappoint my teachers!

56:52.000 --> 56:53.226
- "I will not..."
- "I will not..."

56:53.250 --> 56:55.036
You still owe me money!

56:55.792 --> 56:56.907
Get lost!

56:58.458 --> 57:00.494
I will smile confidently...

57:00.583 --> 57:04.451
- As I strive for success and glory!
- As I strive for success and glory!

57:04.542 --> 57:05.934
Countdown to national college
entrance exam: 32 days

57:05.958 --> 57:07.494
work hard, no regrets

57:07.583 --> 57:09.494
a plus b...

57:16.042 --> 57:17.077
Six bamboo.

57:20.875 --> 57:21.875
Three characters.

57:27.083 --> 57:28.118
Five characters.

57:29.542 --> 57:30.782
Five characters again.

57:39.042 --> 57:40.202
Couldn't do it?

57:40.292 --> 57:41.577
Then you can't eat tonight!

58:11.500 --> 58:12.910
What are you memorizing?

58:13.500 --> 58:14.615
A composition.

58:14.833 --> 58:16.164
What for?

58:16.375 --> 58:18.536
Our teacher can predict exam topics.

58:20.042 --> 58:21.327
Predict?

58:27.792 --> 58:28.952
Don't tell me.

58:29.667 --> 58:30.952
I don't want to know.

58:35.667 --> 58:37.407
Why don't you go to school?

58:38.542 --> 58:40.498
- It's useless.
- It's not.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.240
It's useful for you,

58:46.875 --> 58:48.240
but useless for me.

58:48.750 --> 58:49.990
Bunch of punks.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.206
You dare to cause a scene in my joint?

58:52.917 --> 58:55.078
I'll do your parents a favor
and set things right.

58:55.833 --> 58:57.698
Don't you like to fight?

58:57.792 --> 58:59.077
What are you waiting for?

58:59.167 --> 59:00.167
Fight!

59:14.125 --> 59:15.490
You're too pure.

59:16.208 --> 59:17.493
You don't get it.

59:23.750 --> 59:25.286
Who's protecting you?

59:25.500 --> 59:27.115
Can he protect me too?

59:37.500 --> 59:39.206
Why is it my turn?

59:39.750 --> 59:42.492
I did everything they said.

59:51.667 --> 59:53.828
I'll walk you home.

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:06.157
Does it hurt?

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:09.785
I'm used to it.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.740
Since when?

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:23.998
Since I was 13.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.865
My dad left us.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.241
My mom was burdened with me.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.161
She couldn't handle it.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:43.081
She later met a man.

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.994
I woke up one morning...

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.661
To find that she came home
with some meat buns.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:57.289
I was so happy.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:01.533
Meat buns were a rare treat.

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.411
But as soon as I started eating,

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:10.328
she slapped me.

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:14.077
While crying hard.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.990
That man dumped her

01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:32.493
because of me.

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:42.155
Did she eventually get married?

01:02:49.917 --> 01:02:51.578
I went back to look for her.

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.698
But she had moved.

01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:14.872
Chen nian?

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:22.749
You're the first person
to ask me if it hurts.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:42.823
Hello.

01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:43.917
Thank you.

01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:52.328
Are you being stalked lately?

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:56.748
I'm heading out for a bit.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.950
It's not the first time
I've seen someone following you.

01:04:24.542 --> 01:04:27.329
Can university graduates earn
five grand a month?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.991
More than that.
At least more than thirty grand.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.206
Can we make that much?

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:38.625
Look at us.

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:41.124
We don't steal or deal drugs.

01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:43.408
How can we ever make that much?

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.331
But you're good-looking.

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:51.248
You could sell your body.

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.244
Maybe I'm not who you think I am.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.365
What did you say?

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:08.032
I ignored hu xiaodie

01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:09.990
because she wanted to be my friend.

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.118
I actually liked her.

01:05:15.042 --> 01:05:16.042
Don't you realize

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:18.207
that I don't deserve your kindness?

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.786
What did you just say?

01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:33.577
It's coming!

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:41.664
Focus.

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:45.873
What are you doing?

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:58.408
Do you want

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:01.119
to get away from here together?

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:07.865
How?

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.990
There must be a way.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:28.575
One day, we'll walk proudly
in broad daylight for the world to see.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.823
Come!

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:40.664
- Swerve!
- Come!

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.536
- Medic!
- Shoot!

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:43.489
Everyone, stay calm!

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.039
- Don't run.
- Don't move!

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.828
- Don't move.
- What's happening?

01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:48.873
- Raise your head!
- I am talking to you!

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:50.368
- Come!
- Stand up!

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:51.914
You! What's up?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.581
- You! And you!
- Stand up!

01:06:53.667 --> 01:06:55.123
- You three, come with me.
- Officer.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.119
- Stand up.
- We are really good students.

01:06:57.208 --> 01:06:58.744
- Get in line!
- Come on!

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.573
- One by one, move forward!
- Where to?

01:07:00.667 --> 01:07:01.998
- Stand up.
- Walk.

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.268
- We got a tip-off.
- Move it.

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:05.578
Someone reported seeing
a suspected rapist here.

01:07:05.667 --> 01:07:07.032
- Move.
- Please cooperate.

01:07:24.292 --> 01:07:25.828
How long will this take?

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:27.243
Who knows?

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:28.914
They're looking for a rapist.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.740
A girl is here to identify him.

01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:32.577
Then why did you run?

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:35.283
I thought you were the cafe manager.

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:39.457
- What time is it?
- I clearly don't look like a rapist.

01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:40.702
I'm asking you!

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.784
- It's more likely that I was raped.
- Nobody would want to rape you.

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:45.998
When will you release us?

01:07:46.792 --> 01:07:47.907
It's not your first time.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.615
It'll be done when it's done.

01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:12.116
The number you called is
temporarily unavailable.

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:19.782
Shut up if you want to live.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.331
Shut up if you want to live!

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.823
Be serious!

01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:28.032
Next!

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.247
Shut up if you want to live!

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:41.907
Shut up

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.332
if you want to live!

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.038
Be serious!

01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:48.741
Officer, can I try again?

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.038
Put on the masks we gave you.

01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:53.118
Stand up straight!

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:57.832
The number you called is
temporarily unavailable.

01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:22.703
- Here comes the bitch!
- You're the bitch!

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:23.955
Again!

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:25.157
Dodge!

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:26.872
- Bitch!
- Bitch!

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:29.745
- Slap her!
- Crying won't help. Why bother?

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.490
Are you glaring at me?

01:09:31.582 --> 01:09:33.573
- Where are you going?
- You can't go.

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:35.267
What's more important?
Books or yourself?

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:37.908
You want to go to university?
In your dreams.

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:40.328
- A close-up shot.
- Miao, come here.

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:41.868
- Hit her.
- Go on.

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:47.823
- Good one!
- That's more like it!

01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:50.032
Good lord.

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.243
Come on, go ahead!

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:54.990
Hit her!

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.244
A close-up shot!

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:00.535
Cut her hair!

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:02.911
Cut!

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.865
Uv - cut! Ore, keep going!

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.789
- More!
- Cut it all off.

01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:12.369
So now you're not talking?

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.323
- Goodness.
- Why are you crying?

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:16.203
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:17.202
Quit crying!

01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.248
Do guys even like you?

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:20.833
Let's see.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.828
You're not even pretty.

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:24.823
How did you get guys to help you?

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:26.453
What a pretentious slut.

01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:28.619
You must have a great body.

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.708
Anybody want to see it?

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.578
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:34.409
Let's see what you have! Strip her!

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.333
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:45.792
What are you guys doing?

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.581
- I've called the cops!
- What a bitch!

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:06.241
We just say the same thing
to the police every time.

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:08.699
That guy must be going to prison.

01:11:08.792 --> 01:11:10.077
It's just a bottle.

01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:01.823
Let go!

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:04.202
Let go!

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:05.498
Let go!

01:12:05.958 --> 01:12:07.949
- Let go!
- Go and kill them all, then!

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.208
Students.

01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:26.996
Do a test run of the route
to the exam venue.

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:28.568
Calculate the transportation time.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:30.874
Arrive at least 15 minutes early.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:32.038
Do you hear me?

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:33.581
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:34.667 --> 01:15:35.952
I'll give out the exam permits.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.535
Song yunlin.

01:15:38.792 --> 01:15:39.907
Yi xingtong.

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:42.493
Yang kaiyuan.

01:15:42.875 --> 01:15:44.615
Take note of the exam center.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:47.875
Chen nian.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:57.698

01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:18.452
Of course!

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:20.664
Of course, I believe in my little girl.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.865
I'll be all right.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:26.583
Okay.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.949
I'll be waiting for your good news.

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.369
Forever young!

01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:42.039
Beautiful forever!

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.365
Hooray!

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:45.119
It's about to take off!

01:16:48.042 --> 01:16:49.642

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.911

- One, two, three!

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.241
- All the best!
- Good luck!

01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:12.601
The national college entrance exam
kicks off today.

01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:15.788
There are 9.23 million candidates
this year

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:17.786
surpassing last year's total.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:21.538
Heavy rains have paralyzed traffic
in some parts of the city.

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:24.082
Candidates are advised to set out early

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:25.373

01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:27.449

Check your answers,
double-check, and triple-check

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:43.953
- if you have time.
- Take a deep breath

01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:45.869
before you head in.

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.616
Remember to remain calm.

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:49.708
If you have time,

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.703

Stop writing immediately.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.535
Stand up.

01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:28.078
Proctors, please collect
the exam papers.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:36.741
Wei lai

01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:45.915
Do you own the vehicle
with the plate at3258?

01:21:57.333 --> 01:21:59.790
Where were you on the night of may 31?

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:06.535
I was at the hospital.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:08.368
Many people saw me.

01:22:10.667 --> 01:22:13.454
Surveillance cameras caught your car
near the crime scene.

01:22:13.917 --> 01:22:16.078
Your car trunk tested
positive for blood.

01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:17.288
Can you explain that?

01:22:19.458 --> 01:22:20.538
My car...

01:22:21.958 --> 01:22:23.414
Was stolen.

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:24.625
Stolen?

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.408
Who would return your car
after murdering someone?

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:30.657
Don't you own a motorbike?

01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:34.325
Unless it's someone you know.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.578
What do you need my dad's cab for?

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:38.414
His shift starts early tomorrow.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.206
I want to try driving a cab.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:46.375
Yongkang?

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:47.702
What?

01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:49.285
We're buddies, right?

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.118
Just listen to me.

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:56.744
Get a full medical checkup.

01:22:57.125 --> 01:22:58.410
Test everything.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.740
Don't return home until you're done.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:05.868
Hey!

01:23:07.708 --> 01:23:08.868
You'll be fine.

01:23:09.833 --> 01:23:11.744
Whatever they ask you,
just tell the truth.

01:23:41.375 --> 01:23:42.831
Is she really dead?

01:23:46.042 --> 01:23:47.407
Why are you smiling?

01:23:47.917 --> 01:23:48.917
I'm not.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.740
Wei lai hasn't called me
since that day.

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:51.948
Which day?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.456
It wasn't my fault.

01:23:57.542 --> 01:23:59.453
They were out of control that day.

01:23:59.542 --> 01:24:00.873
If 1 didn't do as they said,

01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:02.448
they would have killed me.

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:04.785
Chen nian killed her.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:06.285
You're accusing chen nian

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.911
because you've been bullying her.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.581
Who's the bully here?

01:24:10.708 --> 01:24:12.289
Wei lai feared for her life.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.206
Quit crying!

01:24:22.042 --> 01:24:24.033
So now you're not talking?

01:24:24.167 --> 01:24:26.453
- Give her a haircut.
- Don't like the haircut?

01:24:26.542 --> 01:24:27.873
What do you think of the haircut?

01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:30.494
You have no right to cry.

01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:33.655
- Quit crying!
- Why are you crying?

01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:45.202
I saw the video.

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:48.869
Why didn't you call the police?

01:24:53.292 --> 01:24:54.907
I had to focus on the entrance exam.

01:24:56.208 --> 01:24:57.948
I filed a complaint once before.

01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:02.958
Can we

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:05.332
postpone this until after the exam?

01:25:06.792 --> 01:25:08.783
I still have two papers tomorrow.

01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:11.125
No.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.661
You must come with me.

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:16.990
Chen nian.

01:25:18.917 --> 01:25:20.248
Wei lai is dead.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:22.115
You're a prime suspect.

01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:51.580
Chen nian, you're being
interviewed as a suspect.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:54.617
Tell the truth and we will be lenient.

01:25:55.042 --> 01:25:56.077
Understand?

01:25:59.917 --> 01:26:01.123
Answer me.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:02.865
I understand.

01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:07.367
Did you tell your mom
about the incident?

01:26:09.042 --> 01:26:10.282
Has she returned?

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:13.208
No.

01:26:15.042 --> 01:26:17.033
Did it affect your studies?

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:19.366
They filmed you.
Why didn't you report them?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.080
As I've said,

01:26:24.458 --> 01:26:25.914
I wanted to focus on the exam.

01:26:26.417 --> 01:26:27.452
Really?

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.581
They took pictures of you naked.

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:32.033
You were assaulted,
but didn't call the cops.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:33.331
How could you stay focused?

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:42.828
When was the last time
you saw wei lai?

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:47.662
I haven't seen her
since that incident.

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:52.745
- How did she die?
- Just answer the questions.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:53.993
Understand?

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.500
Yes.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.162
Where were you on
the night of may 31?

01:27:06.958 --> 01:27:08.368
Studying at home.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:10.157
I study at home every day.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.365
Any witnesses?

01:27:16.125 --> 01:27:18.537
It's okay.
We can ask your neighbors.

01:27:33.292 --> 01:27:34.452
Hey.

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:37.698
Are you done?

01:27:38.917 --> 01:27:39.917
Well?

01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:42.703
She doesn't have an alibi.

01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:45.499
We have a motive but no evidence.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.707
Let's release her for now.
She has exams tomorrow.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.206
Wang li, what do you think?

01:27:52.292 --> 01:27:53.748
I think her reactions were unusual.

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:54.953
What's the correct reaction?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.206
Crying and screaming?

01:27:56.958 --> 01:27:59.916
Don't allow emotions
to cloud your judgment.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.036
How do you explain fang yongkang's car?

01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:03.285
Did chen nian steal it?

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:05.536
She's so tiny.
How could she move the body?

01:28:05.625 --> 01:28:06.660
What's your problem?

01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:08.081
She might have an accomplice.

01:28:08.167 --> 01:28:10.167
What's wrong with you?
You're being unprofessional.

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.490
Enough.

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.119
Calm down, both of you.

01:28:13.667 --> 01:28:15.077
A girl just filed a report.

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:16.994
She was almost raped in a park.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.539
She saw the attacker's face.

01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:20.365
It fits the serial
rapist's description.

01:28:20.458 --> 01:28:22.915
Wang li, the girl is not in...

01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:29.907
Release chen nian.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.410
Keep her under surveillance.

01:29:08.625 --> 01:29:10.536
Anqiao city
college entrance exam center 190

01:29:49.208 --> 01:29:50.414
Do you trust me?

01:30:09.292 --> 01:30:10.748
Time is up.

01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:12.789
Stop writing immediately.

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:17.239
Place your answer sheets
on top of the question book.

01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:19.831
All rise.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:25.412
Proctors, please collect
the exam papers.

01:30:31.792 --> 01:30:36.115
Follow the rules,
eliminate cheating

01:31:10.542 --> 01:31:12.783
- Freeze!
- Stop!

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.240
Bastard!

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.240
Those are cops behind us.

01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:24.665
Didn't you say
we can't be seen together?

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:36.542
Scream for help.

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:39.785
There's no time.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.035
Scream for help now.

01:31:43.625 --> 01:31:45.616
I stalked and harassed you.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.249
I tried to rape wei lai,
but accidentally killed her.

01:31:48.333 --> 01:31:49.539
No. You didn't.

01:31:49.625 --> 01:31:50.625
I left behind evidence.

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:51.948
They're looking for me.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:57.500
I'll turn myself in!

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:02.125
Chen nian!

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:05.581
Take a good look.

01:32:07.083 --> 01:32:08.243
Don't you see?

01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:11.077
I'm a man with nothing.

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:13.658
No brains, no money,

01:32:13.875 --> 01:32:15.115
and no future.

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:18.615
But I love someone.

01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:21.536
I want her to have a happy ending.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:26.618
I won't leave you.

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:31.490
I'm a minor.

01:32:35.125 --> 01:32:36.490
I won't get a harsh sentence.

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:40.698
Once you graduate from university,

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.206
I'll already be out.

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:47.499
I'm not going anywhere.

01:32:49.792 --> 01:32:51.032
If you succeed,

01:32:52.708 --> 01:32:54.164
I won't be a total loser.

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.535
You go first.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.911
- Find somewhere safe first.
- No.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.615
Chen nian,

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.240
when you're all grown up...

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:18.244
We'll meet again, right?

01:33:35.542 --> 01:33:36.657
Don't forget.

01:33:38.542 --> 01:33:39.907
You still owe me one.

01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:18.915
Shut up if you want to live!

01:34:36.125 --> 01:34:36.989
Hold him!

01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:38.118
Don't move!

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.331
Shut up if you want to live!

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:31.706
Help!

01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:42.744
You said you were pretending
to be the rapist

01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:44.698
when you assaulted
zhang jing and chen nian.

01:35:44.792 --> 01:35:46.157
Check the records.

01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:51.074
My buddies and I were brought in

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:53.036
to stand in the lineup.

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:54.539
We were later released.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.240
I'm not the rapist you're looking for.

01:35:58.583 --> 01:36:00.414
I don't understand.

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:02.331
You're a good-looking kid.

01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:04.578
You could easily get a girlfriend.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.328
Why did you do it?

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:08.615
Take a guess.

01:36:09.292 --> 01:36:10.657
If you guess right, I'll tell you.

01:36:11.417 --> 01:36:13.157
- If you guess wrong, I won't.
- Shut up!

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:14.865
I don't have time for bullshit!

01:36:14.958 --> 01:36:16.118
No more questions.

01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:17.664
Just tell me what happened.

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:19.411
Give me all the details.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.286
I told him everything already.

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.042
There's nothing more.

01:36:23.083 --> 01:36:24.243
I'm telling you.

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:28.455
- Concrete evidence carries more weight.
- Then go find the evidence.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.490
I have nothing to add.

01:36:37.167 --> 01:36:39.909
If li lifang saw you now...

01:36:41.958 --> 01:36:43.414
How would she feel?

01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:09.947
I want to give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

01:37:13.667 --> 01:37:16.784
Our people are tracking down your mom now.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:19.323
Do you want to see her?

01:37:22.625 --> 01:37:25.116
Don't you want to know how she is?

01:37:27.958 --> 01:37:30.995
Would you rather confess
or see your mom like this?

01:37:42.583 --> 01:37:43.948
What do you want?

01:37:45.083 --> 01:37:46.083
Get to the point.

01:37:46.833 --> 01:37:48.243
Have you seen this girl before?

01:37:50.917 --> 01:37:53.203
Her name is wei lai.
She was killed and buried.

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:57.661
The lab ran a test and confirmed

01:37:58.292 --> 01:38:00.874
that tissue found under her nails
belongs to you.

01:38:03.417 --> 01:38:05.624
Liu beishan, why did you
kill wei lai?

01:38:17.917 --> 01:38:20.750
Delete

01:38:32.792 --> 01:38:34.912
She would still be alive
if she did what she was told.

01:38:35.667 --> 01:38:37.407
But she kicked and bit me.

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.956
She hurt me,

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:42.539
so I pushed her lightly.

01:38:43.833 --> 01:38:45.243
Then she died just like that.

01:39:22.667 --> 01:39:24.123
I already apologized

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:25.698
to the man who called the cops

01:39:25.792 --> 01:39:27.032
and I also deleted the videos.

01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:28.911
The others all listen to me.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.160
See?

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.706
What do you want?

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:37.573
Don't report me to the police.

01:39:40.667 --> 01:39:41.827
How much money do you want?

01:39:41.917 --> 01:39:43.908
I can pay you as much as you want.

01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:45.410
Just tell me.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.115
Tell me.

01:39:54.542 --> 01:39:57.659
You can film me if you want, chen nian.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.161
Hit me!

01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:02.990
Yell at me! Slap me!

01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:07.036
I can't repeat another grade.

01:40:07.375 --> 01:40:11.368
My dad hasn't talked
to me in a year.

01:40:11.542 --> 01:40:12.942
- Please.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:40:13.917 --> 01:40:15.623
You don't need to forgive me.

01:40:15.708 --> 01:40:17.699
Just don't file a report.

01:40:17.792 --> 01:40:19.874
We all went overboard.

01:40:20.625 --> 01:40:23.037
I'm begging you, chen nian. I'm so sorry.

01:40:23.333 --> 01:40:25.073
Just name your terms.

01:40:25.333 --> 01:40:27.574
I'll agree to anything.

01:40:27.667 --> 01:40:28.907
I'm begging you.

01:40:29.542 --> 01:40:31.908
I can't repeat another year.

01:40:33.958 --> 01:40:36.074
I don't want to see you ever again.

01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:39.323
Understood.

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:52.164
Wait!

01:41:03.583 --> 01:41:05.790
If you don't want to see me again,

01:41:05.875 --> 01:41:08.332
let's not apply to the same schools.

01:41:08.417 --> 01:41:09.827
What's your first choice?

01:41:09.917 --> 01:41:11.123
Mine is Peking university.

01:41:11.583 --> 01:41:12.743
What's yours?

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.081
It's okay if you
don't want to tell me.

01:41:18.167 --> 01:41:21.284
Let's hope we both
do well in the exam.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.080
What a pity.

01:41:24.167 --> 01:41:26.579
We could have been friends.

01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:29.989
Luo ting is an idiot
and xu miao is two-faced.

01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:31.911
But you're decent.

01:41:32.125 --> 01:41:33.365
My mom was right.

01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:34.823
Make friends with good people

01:41:34.917 --> 01:41:36.532
and life will be easier.

01:41:36.625 --> 01:41:37.535
Easier?

01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:38.455
Yes.

01:41:38.542 --> 01:41:40.783
I took care of the video
and you forgave me.

01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:42.411
We can both forget about it,

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.206
like nothing happened.

01:41:44.583 --> 01:41:46.539
It's more important
to live in the present.

01:41:49.625 --> 01:41:51.240
Are you sure you don't want money?

01:41:51.333 --> 01:41:53.369
I would feel better if you took some.

01:41:53.458 --> 01:41:55.414
You can clear your mom's debts.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.242
Then you two can stop hiding
and live with some dignity.

01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:21.077
I failed.

01:42:36.833 --> 01:42:39.040
You said you never met liu beishan.

01:42:40.208 --> 01:42:41.698
Your classmate said he saw

01:42:41.708 --> 01:42:43.539
beishan stalking
and harassing you.

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:44.750
Do you recall that?

01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:48.331
I don't remember.

01:42:50.875 --> 01:42:53.662
She puts up a weak act
and men flock to protect her.

01:42:54.333 --> 01:42:56.244
Are all men such pigs?

01:43:06.667 --> 01:43:08.407
Wang li, I need surveillance footage

01:43:08.417 --> 01:43:10.328
of chen nian's daily
commute to school.

01:43:14.125 --> 01:43:15.661
Zoom in on the person in grey.

01:43:16.375 --> 01:43:17.581
More.

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:30.407
What do you want?

01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:32.407
Study, take the exam,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.331
and go to a good school.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.706
Become one of the smart ones

01:43:37.083 --> 01:43:38.448
and find answers.

01:43:39.375 --> 01:43:40.911
If possible,

01:43:41.667 --> 01:43:43.123
protect the world.

01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:45.956
Can you do it?

01:43:47.167 --> 01:43:48.327
I want to try.

01:44:01.042 --> 01:44:02.077
It's a deal.

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:04.956
You protect the world.

01:44:05.875 --> 01:44:07.115
I'll protect you.

01:44:14.583 --> 01:44:17.245
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

01:44:17.333 --> 01:44:19.198
- Take it all off!
- Let me do it.

01:44:19.292 --> 01:44:20.372
Strip her!

01:44:22.417 --> 01:44:23.452
Strip her!

01:44:23.542 --> 01:44:25.282
Tell me if you can't watch anymore.

01:44:25.375 --> 01:44:27.832
She'll do anything for money.

01:44:27.917 --> 01:44:29.578
What do you mean?

01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.456
This is good stuff.

01:44:32.542 --> 01:44:33.907
But the camera is shaky.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.785
I can't see it clearly.

01:44:38.792 --> 01:44:41.078
Which one is wei lai?

01:44:46.875 --> 01:44:49.082
- I can't tell.
- Why did you skip the middle one?

01:44:50.958 --> 01:44:51.868
It's gross.

01:44:51.958 --> 01:44:53.243
They're all gross.

01:44:53.958 --> 01:44:55.994
You know which one is wei lai.

01:44:56.417 --> 01:44:58.157
- Strip her!
- Come on!

01:44:59.708 --> 01:45:01.039
I don't.

01:45:02.042 --> 01:45:03.452
Why are you showing me this?

01:45:03.958 --> 01:45:05.494
Maybe you've seen her corpse,

01:45:05.583 --> 01:45:08.495
so you know
what she was wearing when she died.

01:45:08.667 --> 01:45:10.077
You should know.

01:45:10.167 --> 01:45:11.782
- Chen nian is here.
- What do I care?

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:13.831
She's next door.

01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:16.408
My colleague is interrogating her.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.912
Was it my fault that I got bullied?

01:45:22.208 --> 01:45:23.823
I'm sorry about
what you've been through,

01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:26.824
but if you had trusted us adults,

01:45:26.917 --> 01:45:28.248
we could have helped you.

01:45:28.333 --> 01:45:29.789
Who can help me?

01:45:30.667 --> 01:45:32.328
The ones who filmed me?

01:45:32.958 --> 01:45:34.573
Or the onlookers?

01:45:34.667 --> 01:45:37.374
Or the ones who blame me

01:45:37.583 --> 01:45:39.119
for being targeted?

01:45:40.542 --> 01:45:42.783
You took matters into your own hands.

01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:45.290
You confronted wei lai and took revenge.

01:45:49.333 --> 01:45:51.949
Revenge may seem normal
to most people.

01:45:52.917 --> 01:45:55.033
But those of us who keep enduring it

01:45:55.333 --> 01:45:57.093
just to get through
the college entrance exam

01:45:57.875 --> 01:45:59.456
are considered wrong?

01:46:02.708 --> 01:46:05.199
If this is how the world works,

01:46:05.542 --> 01:46:07.658
would you want to bring
a child into this world?

01:46:13.042 --> 01:46:14.578
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

01:46:14.667 --> 01:46:15.747
Okay.

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.706
You are chen nian's friend.

01:46:32.458 --> 01:46:33.458
So am I.

01:46:33.875 --> 01:46:35.831
You want to help her, so do I.

01:46:36.375 --> 01:46:38.661
But kid, you're too naive.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.456
You thought you had a perfect plan,

01:46:40.542 --> 01:46:42.203
but we saw through you right away.

01:46:42.292 --> 01:46:43.998
Do you think cops are idiots?

01:46:45.792 --> 01:46:47.123
Even if you keep quiet,

01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:48.914
chen nian is still a prime suspect.

01:46:50.083 --> 01:46:51.539
Do you get what I'm saying?

01:46:52.542 --> 01:46:53.998
We're alone now.

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:55.955
Tell me what happened,

01:46:56.042 --> 01:46:58.328
so I can figure out how to help you two.

01:47:08.292 --> 01:47:09.657
Drop the act.

01:47:11.375 --> 01:47:12.990
Aren't you tired?

01:47:15.333 --> 01:47:17.119
Tell the other guy to come back in.

01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:29.494
Fine, I'll be blunt.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.351
You and chen nian know each other.

01:47:31.375 --> 01:47:32.615
She was bullied and
you wanted justice,

01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:34.286
so you two killed
wei lai together.

01:47:35.042 --> 01:47:37.374
You uneducated fool.

01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:39.956
Chen nian volunteered to come today.

01:47:41.458 --> 01:47:43.369
Do you want to know what she confessed?

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.580
Thanks.

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:18.331
We don't need your confession.

01:48:18.417 --> 01:48:19.702
Chen nian broke down.

01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:21.164
Chen nian,

01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:23.490
what do you know about the world?

01:48:24.167 --> 01:48:26.704
You held out but she couldn't.
She confessed everything.

01:48:27.042 --> 01:48:28.578
What do you know about convicts?

01:48:29.083 --> 01:48:31.699
Do you know
how rapists are treated in prison?

01:48:31.792 --> 01:48:34.158
Everyone will gang up on him.

01:48:35.792 --> 01:48:38.374
Even if you want to sacrifice
yourself for someone else,

01:48:38.917 --> 01:48:40.407
you should first ask yourself

01:48:40.833 --> 01:48:42.273
if she would be able
to live with it.

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.498
Is this what you want?

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.740
You go to heaven

01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:50.240
while someone else rots in hell.

01:48:54.583 --> 01:48:55.743
You accused me

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.740
of letting someone else
take the fall for me

01:48:57.917 --> 01:48:59.578
and leaving him to rot in hell.

01:48:59.792 --> 01:49:00.907
Who did you mean?

01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:04.241
You said that
even if I want to sacrifice myself,

01:49:04.583 --> 01:49:06.119
she wouldn't be able to live with it.

01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:07.952
Who did you mean?

01:49:08.292 --> 01:49:11.614
You said everybody wants to help me.

01:49:12.958 --> 01:49:15.040
But who can actually help me?

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:18.119
Why do you insist
that I'm helping her?

01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:20.953
What do I get from it?

01:49:21.708 --> 01:49:22.914
I'll say it again.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:24.740
Drop the act.

01:49:25.083 --> 01:49:26.914
I'm not making anyone
take the fall for me.

01:49:27.083 --> 01:49:28.948
[, liu beishan, am not an idiot.

01:49:29.125 --> 01:49:31.867
Wei lai's death had
nothing to do with me.

01:49:32.208 --> 01:49:35.245
I only kissed and molested her,
but I don't know her.

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.866
I never met liu beishan before.

01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:54.621
Have you considered the severity
of the sentence for such crimes?

01:50:14.167 --> 01:50:15.167
Hey.

01:50:18.542 --> 01:50:19.542
Zheng yi!

01:50:19.625 --> 01:50:21.456
The suspect cannot meet with the victim!

01:50:21.542 --> 01:50:22.622
Zheng yi!

01:50:30.792 --> 01:50:33.750
Both of you have been lying
from the beginning!

01:50:35.333 --> 01:50:37.184
Once we submit the report,
you won't ever see her again!

01:50:37.208 --> 01:50:38.414
Have you ever thought of that?

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.206
I don't know him.

01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.706
Why don't we get to
know each other now?

01:50:51.833 --> 01:50:52.948
Chen nian!

01:50:53.042 --> 01:50:54.452
- Listen to me!
- Calm down!

01:50:55.917 --> 01:50:57.498
Can't you just trust me?

01:50:57.583 --> 01:51:00.325
- Get up!
- Calm down, zheng yi!

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:02.331
Do you really know what you're doing?

01:51:02.958 --> 01:51:04.698
- Zheng yi!
- Listen to me, chen nian!

01:51:04.792 --> 01:51:06.703
- Calm down!
- Just trust me!

01:51:07.125 --> 01:51:08.240
- Zheng yi!
- Chen nian!

01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:53.699
You were protective of chen nian.

01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:57.242
Why are you now accusing her
of murdering wei lai?

01:51:59.708 --> 01:52:02.905
If someone spends decades
in prison for her,

01:52:04.042 --> 01:52:05.748
she won't be able to live with it.

01:52:06.875 --> 01:52:09.082
No one would take the rap
for murder and rape

01:52:09.167 --> 01:52:10.782
just to protect someone.

01:52:10.875 --> 01:52:12.081
We wouldn't.

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:14.157
But they're still teenagers.

01:53:32.958 --> 01:53:34.198
What's wrong?

01:53:36.542 --> 01:53:37.998
We shouldn't be seen together.

01:53:39.167 --> 01:53:40.202
I don't care.

01:53:41.542 --> 01:53:42.748
It's not that simple.

01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:45.333
Keep walking.

01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:47.160
I'll be right behind you.

01:53:50.125 --> 01:53:51.456
What will you do behind me?

01:53:52.833 --> 01:53:54.039
Nothing.

01:54:07.708 --> 01:54:11.155
Hard work sowed yesterday
will be today's successful reap

01:54:51.833 --> 01:54:54.540
Anqiao city prison

01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:57.661
the entrance exam results are out today.

01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.476
- What's your score?
- First choice universities'

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.081
entry score is 548.

01:55:01.583 --> 01:55:02.914
- Next is 494.
- It's 632.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.456
Total score

01:55:04.542 --> 01:55:06.203
how did you score so high?

01:55:07.875 --> 01:55:09.411
I can't believe it!

01:55:10.042 --> 01:55:11.873
All of your efforts pay off now.

01:55:11.958 --> 01:55:13.323
We made it.

01:55:14.292 --> 01:55:16.374
Good people get good Karma.

01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:20.115
Nian, I love you.

01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.456
I love you!

01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:25.657
Let's eat!

01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:50.953
Keep quiet. I'll go check.

01:55:59.125 --> 01:56:00.831
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

01:56:05.708 --> 01:56:06.868
I was nearby.

01:56:07.333 --> 01:56:09.073
I came by to congratulate you.

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.740
You're free now.

01:56:15.833 --> 01:56:17.118
How do you feel?

01:56:21.833 --> 01:56:23.789
I mean, the feeling of becoming an adult.

01:56:24.458 --> 01:56:25.618
How does it feel?

01:56:27.667 --> 01:56:29.453
Don't want to talk to me anymore?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.206
I understand.

01:56:31.667 --> 01:56:34.454
You're still mad at me
for suspecting you.

01:56:35.042 --> 01:56:37.454
I was disciplined for
what happened.

01:56:45.042 --> 01:56:46.532
I guess I'll go.

01:56:48.208 --> 01:56:50.039
I'll see you off
when you leave for Beijing.

01:57:00.125 --> 01:57:02.332
By the way,
I have good news for you.

01:57:03.542 --> 01:57:04.907
A few days ago,

01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:07.206
liu beishan received
a death sentence.

01:57:12.542 --> 01:57:14.282
Due to the severity of his crimes

01:57:16.375 --> 01:57:18.206
the court quickly reached a verdict.

01:57:20.042 --> 01:57:21.498
Isn't he a minor?

01:57:21.875 --> 01:57:23.081
He lied to you.

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:25.206
Liu beishan is an adult.

01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.118
He would have to bear
legal responsibility

01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:30.661
even if he were a minor.

01:57:50.833 --> 01:57:51.993
Chen nian.

01:57:52.875 --> 01:57:54.866
Go away!

01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:57.285
Why?

01:57:57.375 --> 01:57:58.956
Why can't you leave us alone?

01:57:59.042 --> 01:58:02.330
Why is it so hard to let us be?

01:58:02.417 --> 01:58:03.953
Just let one of us be free!

01:58:04.042 --> 01:58:05.498
Why did you do that?

01:58:05.875 --> 01:58:07.957
Why did you do that? Why?

01:58:08.917 --> 01:58:10.202
Leave!

01:58:20.208 --> 01:58:21.448
I'm sorry, I lied!

01:58:21.542 --> 01:58:22.577
There's no verdict yet.

01:58:22.667 --> 01:58:23.998
He'll be put away for decades,

01:58:24.083 --> 01:58:25.869
but you could be out in a few years!

01:58:27.167 --> 01:58:28.407
Hate me all you want!

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.161
I just want what's best
for both of you!

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.991
Inmate 178, you have a visitor!

02:02:16.833 --> 02:02:18.369
A good student...

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.615
And a small-time punk.

02:02:24.958 --> 02:02:26.789
Must you drag both of them down?

02:02:30.292 --> 02:02:31.953
You've come a long way.

02:02:51.667 --> 02:02:52.873
Where are you going?

02:02:53.333 --> 02:02:54.698
To sleep. I'm tired.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Beishan.

02:03:19.375 --> 02:03:21.536
I feel much more relaxed now.

02:03:22.958 --> 02:03:24.198
It's the same feeling I had

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.832
when I finished my last exam.

02:03:29.333 --> 02:03:30.448
Really?

02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:33.786
Did your teacher's
prediction come true?

02:03:36.250 --> 02:03:37.285
Yes.

02:03:38.208 --> 02:03:39.618
What was the composition topic?

02:03:41.167 --> 02:03:43.374
A letter to 20 years
into the future.

02:03:50.542 --> 02:03:51.827
Are you afraid?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.206
I was.

02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:58.537
Now, just a little bit.

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.660
And you?

02:04:03.292 --> 02:04:04.748
I was a little bit afraid...

02:04:07.125 --> 02:04:08.661
But not anymore.

02:04:15.833 --> 02:04:17.323
If you could go back,

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:19.823
would you do it all over again?

02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:29.865
Answer me.

02:04:36.333 --> 02:04:37.664
There is no "if".

02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:40.490
Besides...

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:45.115
I don't wish for such a scenario.

02:05:33.375 --> 02:05:35.295
Anqiao city
national college entrance examination

02:05:35.333 --> 02:05:36.333
security seal

02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.785
Marking must be standardized

02:05:48.333 --> 02:05:51.040
a letter 20 years
into the future

02:06:23.125 --> 02:06:26.162
Jiupo district, fujiang district

02:07:18.583 --> 02:07:22.405
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

02:07:24.125 --> 02:07:25.410
Anyone?

02:07:25.833 --> 02:07:28.040
"Was" means it has passed.

02:07:28.125 --> 02:07:29.956
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:33.000
But the difference is
that "used to be"

02:07:33.083 --> 02:07:35.415
carries a sense of loss.

02:07:36.083 --> 02:07:37.414
Does everybody understand?

02:07:38.042 --> 02:07:39.532
Let's go over the tenses again.

02:08:33.917 --> 02:08:35.032
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

02:08:35.250 --> 02:08:37.491
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

02:09:56.333 --> 02:09:59.825
Bullying might be happening
all around us.

02:10:00.458 --> 02:10:04.326
Schools are on the frontline

02:10:04.417 --> 02:10:06.203
in preventing bullying.

02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.537
However, school bullying
goes beyond campus borders.

02:10:10.042 --> 02:10:13.455
In 2016, the ministry of education
and eight other ministries

02:10:13.542 --> 02:10:16.739
implemented 11 initiatives
to control bullying on campus,

02:10:17.167 --> 02:10:21.581
including preventions, penalties,
and long-term deployments.

02:10:23.083 --> 02:10:24.914
In November 2017,

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.457
the ministry of education and
ten other ministries initiated

02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:28.831
the anti-bullying
intervention program

02:10:28.833 --> 02:10:30.539
for primary and
secondary schools.

02:10:32.208 --> 02:10:35.871
In 2018, municipal governments
introduced regulations

02:10:36.125 --> 02:10:38.116
to control school bullying

02:10:38.208 --> 02:10:40.950
in accordance
to the state council's guidance.

02:10:42.375 --> 02:10:47.119
When family, society, the law,
and each one of us

02:10:47.625 --> 02:10:49.536
come together and join forces

02:10:49.542 --> 02:10:51.282
we can protect our
younger generations

02:10:51.292 --> 02:10:52.828
and the world from bullying.
