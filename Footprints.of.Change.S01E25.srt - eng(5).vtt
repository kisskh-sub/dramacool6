[Episode 25]

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.229
Ms. Shan.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.310
Section Chief Shan.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.570
Why are you still here?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
I was waiting for you to finish work.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.970
It's so hot out here.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.509
Why didn't you wait inside?

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.810
There are too many people inside.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.940
I was afraid I might disturb your work.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.370
There were some things

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.870
I didn't feel comfortable
saying in your office.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.760
I actually wanted to…

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.890
Let's not talk here.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.240
Let's go somewhere else.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.240
Okay.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.400
Ms. Shan.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
You and our politics teacher, Mr. Qi,

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.490
were in the same grade, right?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.030
You look

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.960
at least 10 years younger than him.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.520
What's your secret?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
I mean, you're so young,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.870
yet you're already
a division-level official.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.870
Section-level.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.710
Oh, a section-level official.
That's so impressive!

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.360
I need to learn from you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.710
and seek your guidance.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.520
Where are you from?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.810
Your Mandarin is so standard.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.040
You must be from Beijing, right?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.240
I wanted to develop my career in Beijing,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.430
thinking there were
more opportunities there.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.750
Kunshan, Suzhou.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.190
You're from Kunshan?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.520
Kunshan is such a beautiful place.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.470
The air is fresh too.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.360
There's an ancient town
I've visited several times.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.310
Every time I go there, I feel

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.750
it has such rich cultural heritage.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.000
You asked me to out

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800
just to talk about these?

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.630
Ms. Shan.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.060
I...

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.520
I actually wanted to ask you for a favor.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.150
I left the government system

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.810
and just started in business.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.960
I really value this job.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.280
Our factory isn't big,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.880
but it supports many people.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.800
If this deal doesn't go through,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800
we might not be able to pay salaries.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.680
Our department has rules.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.090
I'm someone who follows procedures.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.010
Asking me to come here to discuss business

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.340
is inappropriate.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.870
Yes.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030
I'll book a private room
at a restaurant tomorrow.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.750
It allows more privacy.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.120
What's your favorite food?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280
Our staff cafeteria is quite good.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.670
I have other matters to attend to.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.670
I'll be going now.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.840
Ms. Shan.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.080
That's a nice necklace.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.310
Is it a designer brand?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.170
Is it platinum?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.240
No,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.600
a classmate brought it for me from abroad.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.300
What are you doing?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.600
I want to give it to you.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.270
No, no.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.680
It looks good on you.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.900
It suits you well.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.200
Why is there a power outage?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.830
Ye Xining.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.600
Ye Xining.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.240
Ye Xining, wake up.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.800
Wake up.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.240
Why did you drink so much?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.360
Jiuling.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.390
Jiuling.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.040
Jiuling.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.750
Wake up.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.020
Where are the keys?

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.160
Ye Xining.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.159
Ye Xining, wake up!

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.480
The keys!

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.740
I'm looking for the keys, okay?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.370
The keys.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.430
You look small and skinny.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.560
Why are you so heavy?

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.190
Hang in there.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.380
Let me pull harder.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.270
You and

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.150
Shan Huajing are together.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.120
Who am I together with?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.080
Shan

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.790
Huajing.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.010
I'm together with Shan Huajing?

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.840
Do a magic trick for me.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.450
I don't know any magic tricks.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.230
Then, tell me a joke.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.390
What kind of joke?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.380
Sing a song.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.970
You're drunk.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.390
Sleep on.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480
Sit down.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.390
I need to tell you something.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.550
Go ahead.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.960
Lie down.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.200
What?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.910
Lie down.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.120
How can I do that?

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.390
Lie down!

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.150
I can't do that.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.860
Lie down.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.270
I-I'm lying down.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.240
I'll hold you.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.200
D-Don't!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.670
This is inappropriate!

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.150
Thank you.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.840
Go ahead and cry,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.150
if it makes you feel better.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.920
You're awake.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.730
I bought breakfast.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.240
What are you staring at? Eat up.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.550
Miss Ye.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.120
Last night...

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.720
What's your relationship
with Shan Huajing?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720
After you gave her the envelope,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.870
she rejected me.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.350
What did you give her?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.510
Money?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.650
How much did you pay her?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.960
Not money?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.790
Right. The envelope wasn't that thick.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.480
Property deed?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.200
That can't be.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.480
Surely not.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.050
That's too expensive.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.250
Too high a price.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.870
Shan Huajing has a son.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.440
You know?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.740
He's in middle school.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.480
It's possible that you gave her

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.670
an acceptance letter
to a prestigious high school.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.650
Am I right?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.790
Good for you, Yan Jun!

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.440
You are something.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.510
This is clearly a case of bribery,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.320
which should not be encouraged.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.790
But it got the job done.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.790
Miss Ye,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.390
you came to my place last night…

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.550
Did I come here?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.480
Yes, you did.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.230
Did I really?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.790
Yes, you did.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.580
I didn't.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.130
You were dreaming.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.980
I was dreaming?

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.850
You were dreaming.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.590
Was I dreaming?

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.510
You must have been dreaming.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.610
I must have been dreaming.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.440
You dreamed about me.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.790
What's your dream about?

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.170
Don't daydream!

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.940
I was dreaming.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.210
Purse.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.630
Purse!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.670
Here.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.330
Eat while they're hot.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.990
Goodbye.

[Fuxingzhai Restaurant]

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.240
Madam.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.270
Hello.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.360
How's your business lately?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.080
Thanks to you,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.120
it's good.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.200
The usual. Two packs.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.670
Okay.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.240
Since it's thanks to me,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.510
shouldn't you give me a lighter?

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.600
Of course.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.290
Look, I've got it ready.

Have you eaten?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.840
Yes, I have.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.870
By the way, Mr. Yan,

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.270
I have something

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.790
I'd like to ask you about.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.250
Go ahead.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.200
Are you

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.080
and Section Chief Shan at the customs

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.670

We're okay.

I...

You…

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.260
want to befriend Section Chief Shan?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.030
Here's what we'll do.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.910
I'll arrange a gathering in a few days

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.670
and invite Section Chief Shan
to join us for dinner.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.960
Would she be willing
to have dinner with me?

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.000
With me there,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.400
it won't be a problem.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.440
Thank you so much, Mr. Yan.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.830
It's nothing.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:29.840
Madam.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.670
this lady will pay

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.510
the two packs of cigarettes.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.840
Okay. Okay.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.200
Consider it tuition.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.030
No problem.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.510
Here.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.750
Here you go.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.550
Thank you.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.300
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Professor Xiang.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.870
Professor Xiang.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.510
This is...

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.610
Let me introduce.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.690
This is...

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.510
No need to introduce.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.270
You just said

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.200
she's Tong Tong.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.790
Just introduce me directly.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.720
This is Miss Ye.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.470
Miss Ye.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.200
Ye Xining.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.200
Hello.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.630
Please, have a seat.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.490
Let's sit down.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.790
Professor Xiang,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.120
this is my new essay.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.320
Could you take a look at it?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.580
I can review it for you.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.190
Don't you need to use the bathroom?

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:24.910
Go ahead.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.670
Excuse me.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.360
So,

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.570
Miss Ye, you're a teacher too?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:38.910
Yes.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.090
What year are you in?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.450
Junior year.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.670
You're 21?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.910
Twenty.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.870
How old are you, Miss Ye?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.000
A bit older than you.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.630
Indeed,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.490
you do look quite mature.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.040
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.640
My eyesight is excellent.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.950
I'm not nearsighted.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.150
Miss Ye.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.920
How long have you known Professor Xiang?

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.200
Not very long,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200
just a few months.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.069
No wonder

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.950
Professor Xiang has never
mentioned you to me.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.550
But from what I just heard,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.319
Professor Xiang Xiang

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.490
must talk about me to you often, right?

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.849
He just mentioned you.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.270
Here, Tong Tong,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.240
try this.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.770
It's the cola
Professor Xiang loves the most.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.710
Miss Ye,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.440
I've known him for 3 years.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.350
As for him,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.940
I have some right to speak.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.030
He doesn't have

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.020
many female friends at school.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.700
Nor is he close to any girl.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.110
But I think he treats me differently.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.270
We often chat together,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.030
especially about literature.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.720
Whenever he talks about literature,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.050
he becomes so eloquent.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.680
Some people might find it boring

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.830
and don't like hearing him
talk about these things,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.920
but I'm different.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.110
I especially love hearing him talk.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.510
Miss Ye,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.720
what do you usually talk about
when you're together?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.230
We don't talk about these things.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.880
When we're together,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.330
I wash his shirts

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.240
and pants.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.640
When I'm hungry at night,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.970
he makes noodles for me.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.590
No wonder!

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.930
Last time when I went for a walk
with Professor Xiang,

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.160
I noticed that

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.750
his clothes smelled particularly nice.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.310
Miss Ye,

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.710
what brand of detergent do you use?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.460
When did you go for this walk?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.750
Professor Xiang.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.070
How's it?

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.310
What were you two talking about?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.610
Nothing much.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.120
Walking. Chatting.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.660
What do you mean?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.350
Professor Xiang, you must be hungry.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.350
Let's order food.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.160
Tong Tong,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.030
about what Miss Ye just said...

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.430
Tong Tong said
you often take her for walks.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.480
You said those things just now?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.510
No, I...

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.570
Have we ever done any of those things?

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.480
Tong Tong.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.060
I hope you can face your problems.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.690
This isn't the first time, right?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.480
I think our relationship

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.310
is just an ordinary

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.170
teacher-student relationship.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.390
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.400
Although we learn academic knowledge
at school,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.860
developing moral values is also important.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.020
One should seek truth from facts,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.960
be sincere,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.160
and be honest, right?

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.510
You say these things at school,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.790
and you tell my friend outside of school

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.720
the same things.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.270
Do you know what kind of impact

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.720
that might have on me?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.510
No…

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.510
Please stop

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.920
thinking about all these random things

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.220
and telling everyone about them.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.050
I didn't!

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.110
I haven't!

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.920
Could she be gone to jump off a building?

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.070
No.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.810
This isn't the first time she's done this.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.950
I'm sorry about that,

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.600
but I still need to thank you

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.600
for helping me so much today.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.500
Well,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.270
what would you like to eat?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.270
Order whatever you want.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.270
This meal is on me.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.680
I'm not eating.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.680
She has already made me lose my appetite.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.920
Eat by yourself.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.270
Jiuling?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.030
Professor Xiang.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.100
What brings you here?

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.960
Are you here to look for Yan Jun?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.400
No, no.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.270
I'm here to see you.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.200
Please sit down.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.480
I came here to

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.910
show you something special.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.720
Take a look.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.030
Jeans?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.810
Can you recognize them?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.600
These are from that water-damaged batch.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.800
Xining redesigned them.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.880
They're selling really well out there now.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.830
It's truly turning trash into treasure.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.720
They're so fashionable to wear.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.920
When young men wear them,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.120
they look so stylish.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.630
So, I brought one pair specially

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.760
to give to you.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.680
But Jiuling,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.640
this isn't appropriate.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.800
Why not?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.270
What's wrong with me
giving you a pair of jeans?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.600
It's perfectly normal.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.380
When you walk around campus

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.750
or standing on the sports field,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.110
hands in pockets,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.680
your students will see you and think,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.070
"My teacher is so stylish!

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.200
That's so cool!"

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.920
If they like the jeans,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.880
you can refer them to me.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.690
Jiuling,

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.310
didn't Xining tell you?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.110
What?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.880
I'm not teaching at school anymore.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.240
You've left?

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.350
That doesn't matter. Take them anyway.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.640
This is my sincere gift.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.920
It's just for you.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.070
Take them.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.200
Alright, thank you.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.470
No worries. We're practically family.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.830
Now, the two of us

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.310
are selling jeans

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.830
at Qipu Road Market.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.830
It's just a stall.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.720
Xining has never experienced
such hardship before.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.160
She used to have such delicate skin,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.290
but now her face is all tanned and dark.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.270
And when it comes to selling,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.880
she doesn't know how to sell
or how to call out to customers.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.720
She's too shy.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.400
When someone finally wants to buy
and tries to bargain,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.310
she gets upset.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.110
"If the price isn't right, I won't sell."

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.640
Isn't bargaining normal?

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.270
So, we don't sell anything
and suffer for nothing.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.200
This situation,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.710
isn't it heartbreaking?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.590
Jiuling.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.000
Now…

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.410
How about this:

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.420
I'll buy five pairs of jeans from you.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.880
Really, Professor Xiang?

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.060
This is such a big favor.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.720
I thank you on behalf of Xining.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.400
No need.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.240
Then, I'll

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.670
tell her to close the stall right away.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.440
We'll call it a day.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.750
Today's mission is accomplished.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.240
Okay.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.760
Where did you go?

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.160
I went to sell jeans.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.550
How many did you sell?

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.320
Buy five, get one free.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.640
Guess who I sold them to?

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.240
Who?

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.920
I'm not telling you.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.030
Stop chatting.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.380
I have two things to announce.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.920
I have good news and bad news.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.720
Which one would you like to hear first?

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.520
The good news.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.520
The bad news.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.510
Can't you wish us something good for once?

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.680
She picked the good news.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.400
All there's left for me is the bad news!

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.000
Did you even give me a choice?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.210
Our loan has been approved.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.750
That's great news!

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.200
What's the bad news then?

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.350
Mr. Chen's batch of
sand-washed silk fabric...

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.590
He won't sell it to us anymore!

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.440
Why?

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.790
He said...

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.720
the manager from your former workplace,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.450
Director Jin, has withheld it.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.790
That Director Jin...

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.220
I'll go talk to him.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.440
Forget it! You?

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.640
You've already been fired!

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.510
You think you can solve the problem?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.370
You think he'll do you this favor?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.590
I'll go.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.480
People...

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.290
should know their limits.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.230
Listen to that.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.880
You're going to be
the death of me someday.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.920
Could it be as simple as you think?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.880
You think he'll see you
just because you show up?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
Who do you think you are?

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.810
Do you hear that?

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.070
Ye.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.820
We'll still need you to make the trip.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.680
I'll go find him.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.350
Ye, come in.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.720
Thank you for coming down to meet me.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.310
You're a guest now.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.370
It's only natural that I welcome you.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.080
Come, Ye, have a seat.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.610
I heard that recently,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.640
you've been doing quite well in business.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.350
You must've made a fortune with Lu.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.590
It's not that impressive.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.110
We're just a small private business.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.720
We'll need your continued support
in the future, Director Jin.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.110
You're being modest.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.270
Would you like some tea?

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.930
No, thanks.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.270
Wang Li,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.440
go to the store and get Ye a soda.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.120
Sure thing!

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.540
You can have a soda in a moment.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.520
Director Jin,

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.440
that batch of sand-washed silk
for our company

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.750
still hasn't been approved.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.550
I heard it's being held up by you.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.310
What are you talking about?

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.040
I don't have that kind of power.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.270
I do know about that matter, though.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.830
Mr. Chen wants to raise the price.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.310
After hearing the opinions
from the bureau,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.640
he decided to wait a while before selling.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.170
But don't worry.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.750
Did you sign a contract?

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.400
Yes, we've even paid the deposit.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.790
That makes things easier.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.520
I'll ask about it at the bureau.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.410
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.280
Thank you so much, Director Jin.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.360
We were colleagues. No need for thanks.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.240
Here, Ye,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.920
have a soda.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.070
Thank you, Li.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.700
You're welcome.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.090
Here, have some soda.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.590
But there's something

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.220
I need to discuss with you.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.170
Please go ahead.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.310
A factory overseen by our bureau

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.710
has a batch of towels, bed sheets, etc.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.880
They were all for foreign aid,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.270
so they're definitely of good quality.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.400
There are some left.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.030
The factories are all
trying to generate income,

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.890
so they asked me

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.000
if I knew of any sales channels.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.070
As you know,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.920
foreign trade is booming now.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.110
Selling our Chinese
light industrial textiles

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.370
to the European market

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.170
can more than double the price.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.310
I think this is a good opportunity,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.770
so I'm asking if
your company is interested.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.830
Director Jin, I'm just an employee.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.680
I'll have to ask our boss, Mr. Lu,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.720
and discuss it with him.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720
I'll get back to you.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.510
I understand.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.240
Alright, I'll wait for your news.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:05.830
Okay.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.530
Ye,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.790
remember,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:08.750
it's such a great opportunity,

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.110
and I thought of you first.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.110
Isn't that right?

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.790
Yes, thank you, Director Jin.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.070
Well, I won't stay any longer.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.110
I should hurry back

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.840
and tell him about this matter.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.510
Okay.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.920
I'll take the soda with me.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.350
Okay.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.030
Let me walk you out.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.110
It's fine. You don't need to see me out.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.880
I know the way.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.240
Well then, take care, Ye.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:25.880
Take care.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.210
If what he said is true,

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.550
it's good quality and low priced,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.240
why would they work with

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.700
a small company like ours?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.750
They're just taking advantage of us.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.960
Yes, Mr. Lu.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.260
We can't listen to him.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.830
We've done market research.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.590
The best-selling products
in Eastern Europe right now

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.640
are clothes.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.270
Bed sheets and towels won't sell at all,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.470
or they would've sold them themselves.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.350
If we take these goods,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.280
what would we do if they don't sell?

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.880
We'll be stuck then.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.440
What can we do?

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.310
We're just not powerful enough.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.350
We might as well use this opportunity

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.010
to build a good relationship
with Director Jin.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.250
Although I hate him too.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.700
Let's leave it at that.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.280
Is the director male or female?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.400
Female.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.760
She's very young, in her twenties.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.080
Why don't you go then?

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.270
No, why?

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.200
You have to go. I'm counting on you.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.110
You should sing that…

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.960
Lady White Snake for them.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.440
Stop it.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.350
Enough.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.930
Thank you for your trouble.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.400
Let me introduce you.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:38.880
Hello.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.200
This is Professor Xiang, Xiang Beichuan.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.730
He teaches at a university.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.030
Professor Xiang.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:44.930
Hello.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.590
Hello.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.790
Please sit.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.450
Please sit.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.690
Director Hu.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.110
We Shanghai people do business

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.480
with honesty, not empty talk,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.750
so there are some things

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.790
I need to tell you.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.320
This project is a good thing,

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.350
but you need to move quickly.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.590
Well...

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.720
I can only say we'll do our best.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.200

show them the agreement.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.240
Thank you.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.830
will be representing us

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.550
in all dealings with you from now on.

Yin was the top humanities student
in our county's college entrance exams.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.350
His English is excellent.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.550
He can be your translator in the future.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.470
How does that sound?

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.400
That's great.

Perfect.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.160
So, Yin, right?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.330
You'll teach the workers English.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.480
And Professor Xiang, standard Mandarin.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.680
You two together make a powerful force.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.620
How great!

Mr. Yin,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.880
in which year did you take
the college entrance exams?

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.740
Which university did you attend?

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.480
A key university.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240
Professor Xiang,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.000
teach at?

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.910
Tonghua Normal University.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.560
It's also a key university.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.960
for our project.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.510
This is truly the best combination!

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.020
Great. Great!

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.160
Yeah.

before he approves our sandwashed fabric,

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.880
but

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.080
we got the sandwashed fabric after all.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.500
So, we don't lose.
We can actually make a profit.

Whose idea was this?

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.000
It was my idea.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.920
I even told Ye

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.480
that we should take this opportunity

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.400
to build a good relationship
with Director Jin.

See? That's why you're the boss.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.920
Smart thinking.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.030
This kills two birds with one stone.

What's that smell?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.940
It's like green onions

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.500
wrapped in dead rat skin
and dipped in sauce.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.790
Fishy, stinky, spicy, and rancid.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.520
Why did you slander her?

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.480
I wasn't trying to target Ye.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.880
I just can't stand that guy, Lu.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.960
I wanted to curse him, make him feel sick,

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.360
and ruin his reputation!

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.650
If I don't vent this anger,

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:24.780
I'll suffocate.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.640
I'm a man!

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.830
Do I have money? No!

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.240
As for my house,
it's just a few square meters!

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.130
What's wrong with me cursing rich people?

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.570
I just need to vent!

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.230
I earn honest money through hard work.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.340
What are you doing?

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.440
I don't care if you die!

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.000
If you act like this in public,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.440
how are my son and I supposed to live?

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.700
How can we face others?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.480
You work overtime every day

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.070
and even stay at the company every night.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.880
Who knows what you're really doing?

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.960
Were you shopping at the newly opened
Pacific Department Store

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.480
with that Lu a few days ago?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.480
Let me tell you,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.010
my cousin happened to be there that day.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.260
He saw Lu holding your hand!

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.880
Lu holding my hand?

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.670
Don't make false accusations.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.270
I'm telling you, Yu Dongjun.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.190
We can't live together anymore.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.800
Mr. Lu and I are relatives!

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.030
He's my factory director!

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.980
Isn't it normal for us
to look at fabrics together?

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.260
Explain yourself!

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.840
That Lu has a wife and kids too.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.510
Why is he always with you?

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.250
You're convinced
we have that kind of relationship, right?

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.250
Fine. We can't be together anymore.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.820
We're over, Yu Dongjun!

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.440
I've had enough!

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.590
Don't go!

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.320
What?

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.050
Don't leave!

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.870
Explain yourself before you go!

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.140
Get lost!

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.960
Don't go!

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.590
Mom!

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.270
Come back!

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.070
Mom!

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.210
My mom told me to give you this.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.230
It's compensation
for your emotional distress.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.710
This is the money
my mom earned from her stall today.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.510
It's all here.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.710
I don't want your money.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.440
Take it back.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.160
What do you want to do then?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.620
I don't want anything.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.130
Why did your dad do that?

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.150
Because we're poor.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.130
My dad wasn't like this before.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.440
Do you think

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.650
Jiuling will be angry with you?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.670
I don't know
whether I should be angry with her

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.870
or feel sorry for her.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.940
I think she'd rather have you hate her

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.560
than have you pity her.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.320
Yes.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.900
Jiuling is a proud person,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.510
but does that mean I should be slandered?

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.480
Of course not.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.100
But you won't mind.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.310
Because no one will believe the rumors.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.280
You can't represent everyone.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.480
You're a nerd.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.480
I'll tell you one last time.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.280
I'm not a nerd.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360
I understand you.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.880
I will always be on your side.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.320
Close your eyes.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.360
Why?

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.040
Just do what I tell you to do.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.660
I didn't warn you.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.190
You're…

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.790
not upset, are you?

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.440
If keeping my eyes closed like this

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.750
means you'll keep kissing me,

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:40.790
that would be nice.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.470
Alright.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.130
Then, keep them closed.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.460
Don't open them.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:10.950
Ye Xining.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.670
Um...

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.630
You just kissed me.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.890
If we follow

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.070
the natural

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.710
progression of things,

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.280
then next,

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.000
shouldn't we...

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.640
I didn't expect

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.920
you to be so naughty.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.110
I-I mean...

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.110
Shouldn't we

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.230
go out for a meal?

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.980
Rascals aren't scary.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.920
What's scary is

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.370
an educated rascal.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.080
When you kissed me just now,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.250
my eyes were closed.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.360
What?

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.150
You want another kiss

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.010
with your eyes open?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.610
Eyes are the windows to the soul,
you know.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.400
You should sue Yu Dongjun!

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.030
Sue him!

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.230
Wrong way!

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.630
Sorry. Sorry.
