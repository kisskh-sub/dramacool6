00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.658
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.952
I apologize for the delay.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.290
We shall finally begin the competition.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.793
The theme of the first dish is…

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.752
MAENG MAN-SU, EOM BONG-SIK

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:26.669
TANG BAILONG, YA FEIXIU, KONG WENLI

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.090
Mu for "nonexistent," yuk for "meat."

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.636
It is a meat dish
that has never been seen before.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:45.313
You may begin cooking now.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.873
Let's start making our first dish,
spicy galbijjim, braised short ribs.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.916
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.585
- Let us begin cooking the diced chicken.
- Okay.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:23.518
{\an8}- Gil-geum.
- Yes.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.936
{\an8}- Cook Sim.
- Okay.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.167
What? It's two against one?

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.252
Are two people cooking the main dish?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.587
What are they doing?

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.380
So this is their plan?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.784
Cook Eom.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.832
- Ya Feixiu.
- Yes.

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:35.048
What? The cook for the first round
is Ya Feixiu?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.758
What are they thinking?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.602
She's soaking the chicken
in salt, vinegar, and honey.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.521
She's tenderizing the meat.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.981
What is she making?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.066
Stir-fried chicken?

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.238
Let's focus.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.031
Let's boil the meat.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.621
A mere braised short rib dish?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:11.209
Did I expect too much of her?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.295
I will start cooking
when the meat is seasoned.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.505
When will that be?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.714
In half an hour.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.132
Very well.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.019
- Cook Maeng?
- I was done long ago.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.772
{\an8}The griddle is heated and ready too.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:33.690
{\an8}Good.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.277
{\an8}- Give me the gochugaru, chili powder.
- Cook Sim, where is the gochogaru?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.029
Well, you see…

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.282
Cook Min is looking for it at Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.285
- What?
- He should be here by now.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.327
What…

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.540
Here he is.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.042
I have bad news.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.335
Why are you empty-handed?

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.796
The gochogaru is gone.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.423
- What?
- What?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.966
What are you talking about?

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.760
We safely stored it in Saongwon.
Where could it have gone?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.012
Did you look everywhere?

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.514
Yes. I searched every corner.

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:08.766
The gochojang and gochogaru are all gone.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.186
What on earth is happening?
The competition has barely started!

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.896
Did you not check beforehand?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.523
It was there just last night.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.068
This can't be.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.403
I'm screwed.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.698
Cook Min, are you sure?

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:24.866
Yes.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.034
There's no time for this.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.410
If we don't have gochugaru,

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.037
- we have to change the dish.
- What?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.622
How are we to change the dish now?

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.375
Let us just braise the short ribs
in soy sauce.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.253
That is not a meat dish new to the world.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.802
I must prepare a meat dish
they've never seen before.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.263
With short ribs.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.142
A taste that doesn't exist in this era.

00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:57.774
Yeah.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.108
That's it.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:01.903
Everyone, please do as I say.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.197
There's wild grape wine made with rice
at Saongwon, right?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.074
- Yes, there is.
- Shall I go get it now?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.700
- Yes. Hurry.
- Sure.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.827
- And then…
- Why do we need that?

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.080
I need more than just wild grape rice wine

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.831
to create the true flavors
of beef bourguignon.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.583
It needs the flavor of bacon.

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.752
Cook Eom, please get some pig fat

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:20.129
- and coat the griddle with it.
- Okay.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.380
And then…

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.382
{\an8}I also need the aroma of mirepoix too.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.135
{\an8}Instead of onions, carrots, and celery…

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.348
Cook Maeng, please chop
the Pyogo mushrooms, radish, and pumpkin.

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.307
Okay.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.725
Gil-geum, drain the meat.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:33.726
Okay.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.786
- Gil-geum, get me a bowl of water.
- Okay.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.872
- And drain the water from the pot.
- Okay.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.625
This is the best I can do right now.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.739
- Here is the wine.
- Good.

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:35.163
- Let's see.
- Check it first.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.541
Great.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.259
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:49.552
That much?

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.971
Pour it all in there.

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.764
- All of it?
- All of it.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:56.684
WILD GRAPE RICE WINE

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:02.565
This aroma.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.610
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:07.528
This is definitely the aroma of wine.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.491
A mixture of rice and wine.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.952
She is cooking meat in wine.
What could she be making?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.704
That is very strange.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.207
Instead of adding a dash of wine
to get rid of the meat smell,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.460
she is soaking all the meat in it.

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.631
- There is still more left?
- Yes.

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:28.633
They look anxious.

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:29.967
Whatever it is,

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.013
it surely is a meat dish
the world has never seen before.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:37.892
No matter how hard they try,
they cannot win.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:40.102
We will win

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.604
because…

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.109
I have this.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.070
Here.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.322
What did you just put in?

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.032
It's called bouquet garni.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.660
It's a French herb bundle,
and I made the Joseon version.

00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:57.787
Oh, bucket garly.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.376
We're good. Now we let it simmer.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:05.336
How long will it take?

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.091
An hour?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.176
Half a sijin.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.637
- We'll take turns watching the fire.
- Take turns, my foot.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.347
Boiling is my specialty,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.349
so I will make sure it does not burn.

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:19.308
Okay.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.395
What should we call this dish?

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.480
It is braised, but…

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.566
Since it's a blend
of Joseon-style galbijjim

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.151
and western cooking techniques…

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:34.657
Maybe beef bourguignon galbijjim
braised in wild grape rice wine?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.992
What was that?

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.369
She said brabbling galbijjim
braised in wild grape rice wine.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.662
COURSE N° 8 RICE WINE BEEF BOURGUIGNON

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:46.752
Cook Yeon,
what in the world are you making?

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.672
Cooking meat in a pot of wine?

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:53.551
There is a great disparity in skill
compared to the Ming cooks.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.431
{\an8}It looks quite unlikely
that she will overpower them and win.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.309
HAN MIN-SEONG
CHIEF STATE COUNCILOR

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:04.478
They are doubting the skills
of the Joseon cooks.

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:15.323
He says they were no match

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.241
for the best cooks of the Ming
to begin with.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:19.952
However,

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.288
the true value of a dish
is not how it smells

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.707
but how it tastes.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.960
Ultimately, it all comes down
to the excellence of the taste.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:30.963
Our cooks

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:34.050
{\an8}are known to possess the skills
of a guksamussang in Joseon.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.135
{\an8}GUKSAMUSSANG: INDIVIDUAL WHOSE TALENTS
ARE UNMATCHED THROUGHOUT THE NATION

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.138
I am sure it is as you say.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.852
All the finest ingredients
would scarcely suffice,

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:47.897
yet she acts so recklessly.

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:50.858
Look at the Ming cooks.

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.361
Their knife skills are extraordinary.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.196
We shall wait and see.

00:10:55.946 --> 00:11:00.618
Who knows? The wine-soaked meat
could have special qualities.

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.083
It's done.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.834
{\an8}Let's prepare the garnish.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.796
{\an8}Cook Eom, please steam the pumpkin.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.632
Cook Maeng,
please prepare some young greens.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.217
Here you go.

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:51.252
That is heavy.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.597
Okay. We need 30 more minutes.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.599
It'll be done in a quarter of a sijin.

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.561
Do we just have to wait now?

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:09.937
Yes, Cook Eom.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.068
Will you check the plates and cutlery
in case they are blemished?

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.987
Let us start setting the tables.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.113
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.423
{\an8}Cook Maeng, can you pass me the milk?

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:38.841
{\an8}Milk.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.509
Is that pumpkin paste?

00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.137
It's pumpkin purée.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.930
Oh, hurray.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:45.931
- Hurray.
- Purée.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.834
What is this smell? It is so spicy.

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.838
It is a familiar smell
that stings the nose.

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.306
It can't be.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.268
It does not smell like
the typical pepper used in the Ming.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.441
No. There's no way.

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.698
- Uncle.
- Yes.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:48.577
What is this oddly familiar spicy smell?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.721
No.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.390
It better not be.

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.935
I will go back to setting the tables.

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:15.437
Yes, let us do that.

00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:23.112
That liquor looks special too.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.154
What is that?

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:28.242
Is that not the legendary
Qufu Family Liquor?

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:31.495
You mean the liquor that is only
passed down in the Qufu family?

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:35.875
The Ming cooks in action
are truly an impressive sight.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:40.087
However, I do not think that is
a meat dish the world has ever seen.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:46.635
I do not know what Ya Feixiu is preparing,

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.638
but I am sure it is a dish
that the world has never seen before.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.682
Not to mention the liquor
Kong Wenli has prepared,

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:54.351
which is also one of a kind.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.562
Kong Wenli?

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:02.192
He says he is Confucius' descendant.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.820
Kong Wenli will serve you liquor

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.866
you have never tasted before,
called Qufu Family Liquor,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.534
to drink on the side.

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:12.578
A one-of-a-kind liquor

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.496
served by Confucius' descendant

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.582
called Qufu Family Liquor?

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.215
He says whatever food Ya Feixiu makes,

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.177
it will be a one-of-a-kind liquor
that suits a one-of-a-kind dish.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.345
I very much look forward to it.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.741
- Cook Yeon, let me do it.
- Oh, thank you.

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:52.493
{\an8}Please put it on the griddle
so I can flambé it.

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:53.410
{\an8}All right.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:54.662
{\an8}FLAMBÉ: ADDING ALCOHOL TO FOOD
AND BURNING IT OFF QUICKLY

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.332
Cook Maeng,
can you put some of the sauce in here?

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.668
- By "sauce," you mean the seasoning.
- Exactly.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.746
How fascinating.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.958
A dish is completed
with the chef's final touch.

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.589
On top of the bourguignon
with a deep and rich flavor…

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:35.345
puffed rice is added
to give it a crunchy texture.

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.350
A flower is shaped from cucumbers.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.896
Adding the pumpkin purée on top
will add a subtle sweetness.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.733
Then the diced chicken
is carefully placed in the middle.

00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:58.619
And that completes a meat dish
the world has never seen.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:02.247
Lastly, topping it with fragrant
young greens completes the dish.

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:08.337
The time is up.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.840
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:38.659
It is time for the tasting.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.287
After you taste the food,

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:45.999
we will provide you
with paper, ink, and a brush.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.086
Please rate the other nation's dish,
the highest score being ten.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:55.175
First, you will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks.

00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:35.275
The moment the meat touches my tongue,
it disappears as if it is melting away.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.569
It is an incredibly tender dish
that I have never tasted before.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.821
What is the name of this dish?

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:41.657
This dish is called

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.743
beef bourguignon
braised in wild grape rice wine.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.120
It's a traditional French stew dish.

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:50.040
We braised top-shelf short ribs
in wild grape rice wine for a long time

00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:54.294
to add deep flavor
and make it a Joseon-style galbijjim.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.171
"Tough self" galbi?

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:00.384
Beef burgy yawn
braised in wild grape rice wine?

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:18.860
He says the meat
not only melts in his mouth,

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.071
but also has a sweet, fruity aroma.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.323
It is truly delicious.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.909
The deep flavor and aroma
of the wild grape rice wine

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:29.079
remain in my mouth,
yet I do not taste the wine.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.039
Why is that?

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:36.128
The alcohol in the wine
evaporated as the meat simmered.

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.713
Not to mention the flambé.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:38.755
Plum bay?

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:42.301
Oh, it's called "flambé."

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:45.345
You saw how the flames flared up
and died down earlier, right?

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.806
- That burned the remaining alcohol--
- "Our cool"?

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:51.727
No, so… It got rid of the wine taste.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.188
Impressive indeed.

00:21:56.898 --> 00:22:00.694
It has a light and fresh aroma,

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.989
and the meat is so tender
that it melts in my mouth.

00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:06.116
You are incredibly skilled.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:11.747
I am certain not many cooks in the Ming
can make a dish like this.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.419
He says that may be the case.

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.005
The natural flavor of the meat

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:21.882
goes well with the delicate aroma
of the wild grapes.

00:22:21.965 --> 00:22:23.133
It is truly the finest of all delicacies.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.760
Thank you.

00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:36.605
He says it is still just galbijjim,

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:39.524
so it does not qualify as a dish
the world has never seen.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.278
This is a dish

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.531
that doesn't exist in current times.

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:49.409
What does that mean?

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.119
It's a home-cooked meal
that will come about

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:53.955
a few hundred years from now
in the French countryside.

00:22:54.664 --> 00:22:55.916
And also,

00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:57.667
this is a personal story,

00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:00.212
but this dish doesn't exist for me either.

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:04.174
This dish

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:08.553
is something that French mothers
prepare for their families.

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:12.349
Whenever I make this dish,

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:17.896
I imagine how it would taste
if my late mother

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:20.649
made it for me.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.443
Therefore,

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:27.864
this dish doesn't exist in this era,

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:31.034
and it doesn't exist anywhere else
in the world for me as well.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.889
Next, you will taste the dish
made by the Ming cooks.

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:05.986
What is this dish?

00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:11.992
I made this
for the first time today, my lord.

00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:23.003
It is made with chicken and nuts,
so she named it "gyejeong,"

00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:25.130
and it is served with Qufu Family Liquor.

00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:26.089
"Gyejeong"?

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:28.592
That food was introduced later
in the Qing Dynasty.

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:31.428
{\an8}What is Kung Pao chicken,
a Sichuan dish, doing here?

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:35.265
{\an8}No way. Is she the creator of gyejeong?

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:19.476
It is pleasantly spicy yet sweet,

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:21.061
and even nutty.

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:24.731
It is very strong.

00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:26.650
What is this?

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.086
It is extremely moist.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.755
How is that?

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:53.051
I cooked the chicken just enough

00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:56.763
that it was cooked all the way through
without losing its moisture.

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:02.519
And she says peanuts were added
for the nutty flavor.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.440
How did you create
this intense spicy flavor?

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:16.199
She said she added a secret sauce
to the chicken to make it spicy.

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:18.743
I wonder what that secret sauce is

00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:24.082
that gave your dish
an intense yet captivating spiciness.

00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:34.050
The clean yet rich taste
of the Qufu Family Liquor

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:36.011
balances out the spiciness.

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:39.139
I would expect no less of a liquor
passed down for generations.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:48.398
However, in what way is your gyejeong
new to the world?

00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:50.358
For a long time,

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.819
we have been eating a similar dish
in Joseon called chicken gangjeong.

00:26:57.324 --> 00:27:00.618
I have tasted that dish myself.

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:02.620
However, what I made is different.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:11.921
She used a red oil called "layu"
that the world has never seen before.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.424
A red oil called "layu"?

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.233
He says Ya Feixiu,
who created a new seasoning called layu,

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:34.110
is the pride of Ming.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.787
He says the silky red
and fine-colored layu

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.122
is something no one has tasted before.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.918
I'm positive that she made that
with our gochu, chili peppers.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.212
Even if she's a genius,

00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:54.214
you can't make layu without gochu.

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:55.757
I have bad news.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.550
The gochogaru is all gone.

00:27:58.134 --> 00:27:59.135
Did she…

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.561
He is suggesting that you make
a decision now, Your Majesty.

00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:10.146
Let us do that.

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:14.025
Which dish did you find more special?

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:20.448
I am sorry to say
I preferred Ya Feixiu's diced chicken

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.827
to Joseon's braised short ribs.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.205
Joseon's dish was exceptionally good,

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:30.834
but it is hard to believe
that the dish does not exist in this era,

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:34.421
and the story behind it
was also too personal.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:41.052
He says he cannot give a high score
to Joseon's galbijjim.

00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:45.140
However, the beef burgy yawn
braised in wild grape rice wine

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:48.852
was definitely prepared in a way
that did not exist until now.

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:50.562
Therefore,

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.605
I cannot give a high score

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.358
to the Ming's version
of chicken gangjeong.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.958
SEVEN

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.468
FOUR

00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.913
I will announce the result
of the first round.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.876
Wait, Your Majesty!

00:29:59.005 --> 00:29:59.923
What is it?

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:03.635
Before you announce the winner,

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:06.429
please allow me to taste Ming's dish.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.733
He asks what your intention is
behind the request.

00:30:19.692 --> 00:30:21.986
Ya Feixiu is certainly a great cook,

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.239
but I'd like to check something
before the final judgment.

00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:26.991
How dare you? The judgment is to be made

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.827
- by His Majesty and the chief envoy.
- Wait.

00:30:31.037 --> 00:30:32.163
I apologize, Director Yu.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:37.085
What is it you wish to check?

00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:40.672
- An ingredient, Your Majesty.
- An ingredient?

00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:44.008
I won't know for sure
until I taste Ya Feixiu's dish.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:48.555
Are you saying
she used a banned ingredient?

00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:50.723
Please let me taste the food just once.

00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:52.016
Please.

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.396
He will not allow it!

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:23.756
Uncle, why would you give that to her?

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.343
Bailong, what are you doing?

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:38.771
The result of any cooking competition

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.690
- comes down to the taste of the food.
- He is curious about the Joseon dish

00:31:40.773 --> 00:31:42.483
and suggested
they taste each other's food.

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:45.153
Bailong, it is not for you to decide.
Step back!

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.155
Do you not mind that our cooks

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:51.659
may be subjected to mockery
by the cooks of this small nation?

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:55.121
Director Yu.

00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.289
You should sit back down.

00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:59.459
The pride of the Ming depends on this.

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:02.128
Please give your permission, my lord.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:11.262
The cooks from both nations
wish to taste each other's food.

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:14.641
As the King of Joseon,
I give my permission.

00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:23.358
He says he also gives his permission
as the chief envoy

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.193
of the great nation of Ming.

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.589
This taste…

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.218
The aroma, color, and taste.

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.553
It lacks nothing at all.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.389
This is truly

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.684
a perfectly balanced dish.

00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:07.318
This is definitely layu
made with our gochu.

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:11.990
Where did you get this red oil?

00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:14.367
Is it an ingredient you brought?

00:33:20.748 --> 00:33:21.791
Ya Feixiu.

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.714
- Yes?
- Where did you get the red powder?

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.886
She says she obtained the ingredient
through legitimate means in Joseon.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.182
This is our gochugaru.

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:41.060
The cooks and I picked the gochu
and dried them in the sun.

00:33:41.144 --> 00:33:42.729
We poured our hearts into making it.

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:47.608
It was a secret ingredient that had
a key role to play in the first round.

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:50.278
How did you get your hands on it?

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:55.783
The gochugaru and gochujang

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:58.828
are secret seasonings that will be
very important in the competition.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.830
Secret seasoning?

00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:03.124
Then is she saying the red oil

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.293
was made using gocho?

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:08.337
How did the Ming cook obtain that?

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.008
Your Excellency.

00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:13.551
We can listen to
what the cooks have to say

00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:16.262
after we decide on a winner.

00:34:16.345 --> 00:34:19.348
Let us make a judgment now.

00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:22.018
Director Yu.

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:24.771
For cooks,

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:28.649
ingredients are like a scholar's brush
and a warrior's sword.

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:31.486
If this happened to you,

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:33.237
would you let it slide?

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:40.703
Ya Feixiu.

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:43.247
Explain what happened.

00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:47.001
Did you steal their ingredient?

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.879
Uncle, I did not steal it.

00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:57.011
She says she obtained it fairly
by exchanging it with huajiao.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.346
Were you aware

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:02.517
that Joseon's chief royal cook
was going to use it in the competition?

00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:05.770
- Well…
- Ya Feixiu!

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:11.192
You did something a cook should never do.

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.986
You stole someone else's ingredient,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:18.074
and you did not tell me about it.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:21.619
Your conniving trickery

00:35:21.702 --> 00:35:24.288
insulted the name of our great nation,
as well as this competition.

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:27.083
As a cook, I cannot forgive you for this.

00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:29.043
Uncle…

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.088
Ya Feixiu did something

00:35:32.171 --> 00:35:34.465
a cook should never do.

00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:45.184
He says he will admit to the Ming's defeat
in the first round of the competition.

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.605
Tang Bailong!

00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.859
Maintain your dignity, Director Yu.

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.653
It seems we have a winner.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.994
The cooks you brought

00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:06.873
certainly possess unmatched skill.

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:10.501
However, no matter how highly skilled
a cook may be,

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.336
one must learn

00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:15.339
basic human decency first.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.217
Do you not agree?

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.808
I appreciate what you said,

00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:28.394
but what I want to know
is where you got this from.

00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:34.317
The outcome of the first round is decided.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.902
You won.

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:39.197
- No, that's not--
- Wait!

00:36:40.781 --> 00:36:42.450
I did not lose.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.410
Uncle.

00:36:45.244 --> 00:36:46.412
I will prove

00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:49.707
that I got the red powder
through legitimate means.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.335
Admit your defeat, Ya Feixiu.

00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.880
- You stole their ingredient.
- I did not!

00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:10.102
She says she got the gochogaru
from Saongwon.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.730
Saongwon?

00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:15.566
That's impossible.

00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:22.907
The person who gave it to her was…

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.750
It is him.

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.752
What? Who?

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.798
Grand Prince Jesan?

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:53.271
Uncle.

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.232
What is she talking about?

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.067
The Ming cook says you gave her

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.569
the chief royal cook's ingredient
without my permission.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:02.697
Is she telling the truth?

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.880
Your Majesty.

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.173
With all due respect,

00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:24.427
I did not need your permission.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.638
When ingredients are admitted
to be used in the royal kitchen,

00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:31.309
they are checked,
and only the produce cleared by me,

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.519
the Superintendent of Saongwon,
can be stored.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.396
What are you saying?

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.939
I had heard

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:42.111
the chief royal cook was using
some red powder and red paste

00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:45.323
in the royal kitchen
without proper approval.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.449
That is why

00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.327
I had them all thrown away.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.291
For the health and well-being
of the royal family is paramount.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.337
So you did not give it to the Ming cook?

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.798
You could say I did. I let her take it.

00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:04.258
I did.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:08.054
She offered to exchange it
for some valuable Ming huajiao.

00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.723
I thought the trade was in our favor,

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:13.476
so I allowed her to take
as much as she needed.

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:18.064
Chief Royal Cook,
if you had told me in advance,

00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:20.524
I would not have thrown it away.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:22.193
What a shame.

00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:34.789
Your Excellency, it seems
Grand Prince Jesan has made a mistake.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.091
He says since Ya Feixiu is not at fault,
the scores should be announced.

00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:49.512
Ya Feixiu.

00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:52.556
Do you still not know what you did wrong?

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.058
Uncle.

00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:55.643
I am innocent!

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:58.354
Even if you obtained the ingredient
in a legitimate manner,

00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:00.564
you took it knowing the red powder

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.067
was Joseon's chief royal cook's
secret weapon.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.693
As a result,

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:08.489
she had her ingredient stolen
without knowing it.

00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:12.243
You do not deserve to be a master cook.

00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:14.870
You are unqualified to be one.

00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.707
This is your last chance.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:21.043
If you have any pride left as a cook,

00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:24.296
admit defeat.

00:40:27.049 --> 00:40:28.008
Uncle.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.386
He told her to admit defeat.

00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:32.221
Excuse me.

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.642
I'm also responsible.

00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:43.107
He says he refuses your pity.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.066
No.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.360
I'm at fault too.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:50.573
I felt wronged that I lost the gochugaru
that I'd worked hard to make.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.577
But I'm partly at fault for failing
to keep a valuable ingredient safe,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.663
as I lacked the understanding
of how things work here.

00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:59.373
So please stop.

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:12.303
He thanks you for your considerate words,
but claims that the Ming has still lost.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:19.768
Do you not think

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:22.980
both cooks make a valid point?

00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:26.609
The Ming cook received the ingredient
from the Superintendent of Saongwon,

00:41:26.692 --> 00:41:27.818
so she is not to blame.

00:41:28.694 --> 00:41:30.029
Joseon's chief royal cook

00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:32.406
had the ingredient she prepared
stolen from her,

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.158
so she has the right to feel wronged.

00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:38.370
That is right. Moreover,
the Ming's Chief Royal Cook Tang Bailong

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:42.291
has expressed that they have lost
regardless of the outcome.

00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:43.375
That is right.

00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:46.879
Even if you announce the Ming's victory,

00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:50.591
the Ming cooks
will not accept that result.

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.343
Even if you rule in Joseon's favor,

00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:56.096
it will do nothing
to console their hurt feelings.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.139
However,

00:41:57.223 --> 00:42:00.309
we cannot annul the result
right from the first round.

00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:02.853
The cooks' pride and the scores
are separate matters.

00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:05.231
Therefore, the scores should be revealed.

00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.774
Yes, that is right.

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:12.071
I can make no excuse for what happened.

00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:15.407
Your Majesty.

00:42:15.491 --> 00:42:18.494
I suggest you make the judgment.

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.456
In that case,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.375
I shall annul the result

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.169
and call it a tie.

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:28.921
Your Excellency.

00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.507
You cannot call it a tie when we won.

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.053
What do you mean you won?

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:38.264
The scores were not yet revealed.

00:42:42.017 --> 00:42:43.769
He says he is sure the Ming won.

00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:52.069
Let us do this.

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.655
In return for annulling today's result…

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.494
I will suggest something in Ming's favor.

00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:04.456
Very well.

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:17.261
As this round proves too close
to determine the winner,

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:19.680
it is a tie.

00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:26.812
However,

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:32.192
it is true that the Ming
came slightly ahead in this round,

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.737
as the cook developed
a new sauce called layu.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.365
Nevertheless, since it was made
with an ingredient from Joseon,

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.367
this round will be considered a tie

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:43.078
with the grace of the King of Joseon.

00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:46.415
In the upcoming rounds,

00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:49.376
both sides must ensure nothing disgraceful
happens again due to ingredients.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.920
And if all three rounds end in a tie…

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.966
it will be considered the Ming's victory.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.220
The Ming gets an advantage?

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.598
Does that mean I just lost?

00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:04.433
There's no way.

00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:06.018
The second round

00:44:06.101 --> 00:44:08.479
will be held here tomorrow
at the same time.

00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:10.648
Be well prepared.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.900
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:49.645
- Wait.
- Goodness, that scared me.

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:50.729
Do you have more to say?

00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:52.356
What is it?

00:44:57.403 --> 00:44:59.154
She says she wants to apologize
to the chief royal cook.

00:44:59.238 --> 00:45:01.698
What's this? She's really apologizing?

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:05.536
Not everyone admits to their mistakes.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.830
Now you are acting like a cook
of a great nation.

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:09.706
Through this round,

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.294
I learned the attitude and mindset
a cook should have

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.296
toward their ingredients.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.383
Thank you.

00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:21.468
She thanks you for the lesson.

00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:24.096
I also

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.683
learned that I should take better care…

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.812
of my ingredients, thanks to you.

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:42.406
She says you will learn even more tomorrow
since you will be up against her uncle.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.992
I have nothing more to learn,

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.452
because I'll win tomorrow.

00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:53.292
See you tomorrow, Chief Royal Cook.

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.847
This is driving me nuts.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.434
I spoke confidently earlier,
but what am I going to do about tomorrow?

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.520
How could the Superintendent do that?

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:14.980
Where did all the gochogaru go?

00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:19.276
We picked them until our fingers bled
and dried them until we wept,

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.444
and he just gave them all away.

00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:21.904
We cannot lose tomorrow.

00:46:21.987 --> 00:46:24.156
Even if it is a tie until the last round,
that is still our defeat.

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:25.532
My goodness.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.869
What is important
is that we did not lose today.

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.120
That's enough, everyone.

00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:32.080
Tomorrow's round is important,

00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:34.291
and we don't have any gochugaru.

00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:35.375
Goodness me.

00:46:39.004 --> 00:46:39.880
All right.

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.090
First,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.968
I'll explain tomorrow's dish.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.887
- Gil-geum.
- Yes.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.349
{\an8}Do you all remember this laziji dish?

00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:52.226
Yes. Spicy stir-fried duck.

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:55.270
Will we still manage
without the gochogaru?

00:46:56.688 --> 00:47:00.526
Would not dongpo pork be a better choice
if we want to trample on their pride?

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:01.777
What about clam and lotus root soup?

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.863
That is one of the Ming's
three great dishes.

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:08.033
No. We'll stick to what we prepared.

00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:11.078
{\an8}But instead of spicy duck laziji,

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.163
we're going to make Peking duck.

00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:14.581
Peking duck.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:18.126
During a diplomatic conference
between the US and China in the 1970s,

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:23.632
this iconic dish is said to have
broken the tension in an instant.

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:25.676
- What?
- Peking?

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.470
- Peking?
- Is that also a Ming dish?

00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:29.846
I have never heard of it.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.848
It's an imperial dish
that has been enjoyed

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:34.560
by the Ming imperial court for many years.

00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:36.728
Is that not just a plain roasted duck?

00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:37.771
Yes, it's a roast dish.

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:41.108
But it's not just any roasted duck.

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:44.987
The key is to blow in air
to separate the skin from the meat,

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.240
and it really isn't easy
to get the crispy texture on the skin.

00:47:48.323 --> 00:47:52.578
Do you really think
that dish will captivate the chief envoy?

00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:56.999
The chief envoy is someone
closely related to the imperial court.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.627
He'll focus on how much care
and effort went into utilizing

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.754
traditional cooking techniques
and the harmony of flavors.

00:48:02.838 --> 00:48:06.800
That's why the Peking duck,
an imperial dish, is the best choice.

00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:13.932
The only way to salvage the dried duck
without gochugaru

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:16.226
is to make Peking duck.

00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:20.230
First, you must learn about the hanging
roasting method we'll be using.

00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:22.190
The Joseon cooks

00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:24.735
- were much more impressive
- The duck…

00:48:24.818 --> 00:48:26.862
- than I thought.
- Look.

00:48:26.945 --> 00:48:30.490
Especially the chief royal cook.

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:33.327
A warrior's sword takes lives,

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.246
and a cook's knife gives life.

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.833
She is a true master.

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:44.129
It seems we have
greatly underestimated them.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.256
We must win tomorrow.

00:48:49.384 --> 00:48:52.512
Are all the ingredients prepared?

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.348
Yes, Brother Tang.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.110
The Ming cooks were great,

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:11.948
but the galbijjim was truly remarkable.

00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.408
I agree.

00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:16.203
The talents of the cooks
were truly tempting.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.959
It was a full day of good food
and good entertainment.

00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:24.503
My goodness.

00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:29.007
The moon is especially bright tonight.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.677
It is bright indeed.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.886
- Oh goodness.
- What?

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:34.304
Your Highness.

00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:36.014
Please come with me.

00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:37.849
His Majesty wishes to see you.

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:40.435
Me?

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.229
Uncle!

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:50.070
What were you thinking?

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.531
You knew of the competition with the Ming,

00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:55.242
yet you discarded the chief royal cook's
ingredient at your own discretion?

00:49:56.076 --> 00:49:57.285
Your Majesty.

00:49:57.369 --> 00:50:02.082
I sincerely apologize for my usual
carelessness and incompetence.

00:50:02.624 --> 00:50:05.043
However, as I explained earlier,

00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:08.171
I did what I did
for the sake of the royal family.

00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:11.717
I never imagined that it would

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.261
affect the outcome of the competition.

00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:16.221
Tell me.

00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:20.142
Did you truly dispose of all the gocho?

00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:23.395
I gave some to the Ming cook,

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.440
and the rest are in the storage.

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:27.441
Chief Royal Secretary!

00:50:32.446 --> 00:50:36.199
Retrieve the gochogaru from his residence
and return it to the chief royal cook.

00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:39.578
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will do as you command.

00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:47.711
A tie?

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:50.088
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.424
In the event that the remaining rounds
also end in a tie,

00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:54.509
the Ming will be ruled the victor.

00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:57.846
Is that not a disadvantage to us?

00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:01.433
{\an8}If His Majesty suggested
such a disadvantageous condition…

00:51:01.516 --> 00:51:04.936
{\an8}The chief royal cook
must have lost the first round.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.688
However,
the first round concluded this way

00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:11.276
{\an8}because Grand Prince Jesan
gave the chief royal cook's ingredient

00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:13.195
to a Ming cook by mistake.

00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:14.112
What?

00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.740
Grand Prince Jesan
took the chief royal cook's ingredient?

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:20.994
How could that be called a mistake?

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:23.872
As he is the Superintendent of Saongwon,

00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:25.916
he must be related to this matter
in some way.

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:30.837
What could he stand to gain by discarding
the chief royal cook's ingredient?

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:42.682
So I hear today's round ended in a tie.

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:44.518
Yes, Your Grace.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:48.146
I summoned you to confirm our agreement.

00:51:50.232 --> 00:51:51.775
I am sure you remember.

00:51:51.858 --> 00:51:53.819
We must lose at all costs tomorrow.

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.695
However, Your Grace,

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:59.115
I heard winning this competition
could bring Joseon a great profit.

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:02.494
Since when have you concerned yourself
with the matters of the state?

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.830
I apologize, Your Grace.

00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:09.543
Your mother resides in Jecheon County,
does she not?

00:52:11.711 --> 00:52:13.046
Your Grace, how did you…

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.139
{\an8}HUIJEONGDANG
SECOND ROUND OF THE COMPETITION

00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:24.683
{\an8}It is time to begin

00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:27.018
{\an8}the second round of the competition
between Joseon and the Ming.

00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:28.979
Today's theme is

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:32.023
ji for "know," yeok for "change."

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.860
You must cook a dish
from each other's country.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.993
You may begin cooking now.

00:52:51.042 --> 00:52:53.920
Let's start making our second dish,
Peking duck.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.338
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:58.425
Use this and this. Let us begin.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.384
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:23.950
What's that smell?

00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:47.933
My gosh. It smells lovely.

00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:51.019
This is not the time
to be marveling at that.

00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:55.023
Where did they get
such a massive lotus flower?

00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.775
It is overwhelmingly big.

00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:58.902
If my guess is right,

00:53:58.985 --> 00:54:01.363
that big a lotus flower…

00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:04.658
That is a golden lotus.

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.534
A golden lotus?

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.873
He asks if you have not seen one before.

00:54:11.957 --> 00:54:15.543
It is surprising that a lotus flower
that big and yellow exists.

00:54:15.627 --> 00:54:20.548
It is also known as the Emperor's lotus
due to its golden color.

00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.034
{\an8}Okay. We'll start
by hanging the ducks to roast.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.035
{\an8}- Okay.
- Okay.

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.705
{\an8}- Cook Maeng, please bring this over too.
- Very well.

00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:13.852
Duck?

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:21.818
Is that the Northern Capital roast duck?

00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:24.195
Is that the fare of the Northern Capital?

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.991
It is a dish even the best Ming cooks
would not dare to make.

00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:30.326
I wonder if it will even taste right.

00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:36.583
He is doubting
the chief royal cook's skill.

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.668
Since my chief royal cook prepared it,

00:55:38.752 --> 00:55:41.337
it will not be any ordinary roasted duck.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.428
Roasting by hanging.

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.264
Must we do this
when it is not even a whole pig?

00:55:52.265 --> 00:55:56.019
What if the meat overcooks
and becomes tough?

00:55:56.102 --> 00:55:59.272
The strong heat will cook it slowly,
so the fat will get completely drained,

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.691
making the skin crispy
and the meat tender.

00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.402
I hope that is the case.

00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:06.738
Cook Maeng, please chop the vegetables.

00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:08.740
Cook Eom, please cook the glutinous rice.

00:56:08.823 --> 00:56:09.991
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:56:14.579 --> 00:56:16.623
- Cook Sim, pass me the glutinous rice.
- Cook Min.

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.333
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.376
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.328
Here we go.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.248
Okay.

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:47.755
The skin is unbelievably shiny and golden.

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:51.468
Pouring oil over it like this
hardens the skin

00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.219
- and makes it what again?
- Crispy.

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.554
That's right.

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.021
Let me try. Give it to me.

00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:05.982
Thank you.

00:58:19.537 --> 00:58:20.997
The knife work is important.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.875
It's a stir-fried dish,
but before the meat meets the sauce,

00:58:23.958 --> 00:58:26.586
the skin and meat
must be thin and evenly sliced

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.754
for maximum flavor.

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:28.963
Cook Eom, have a go.

00:58:29.547 --> 00:58:30.423
My gosh.

00:58:31.382 --> 00:58:32.842
I even cut the bones.

00:58:33.384 --> 00:58:34.802
You are crushing the whole thing.

00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:37.472
- I forgot how to start.
- Cook Maeng.

00:58:38.056 --> 00:58:40.850
Can you do it yourself, Chief Royal Cook?

00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:45.104
Is this not good enough?

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:49.609
Gil-geum, you're good at this.

00:58:59.285 --> 00:59:01.829
We must lose at all costs tomorrow.

00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:04.123
If you disobey me again this time,

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:07.544
I cannot guarantee your mother's safety.

00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:19.889
Do you understand?

00:59:19.973 --> 00:59:22.433
This is the last chance I am giving you.

00:59:25.019 --> 00:59:25.979
Oh my!

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:27.480
- Oh no.
- Blood!

00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:28.690
- Stop the bleeding first!
- Oh dear.

00:59:28.773 --> 00:59:30.233
- Gil-geum!
- Yes.

00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:32.318
You should have been careful!

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.487
- Press on it.
- This is not like you.

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.072
- My goodness, how did this happen?
- What happened?

00:59:36.155 --> 00:59:37.824
You rarely make a mistake.

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.826
You must have been too nervous.

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.911
Goodness me. Stop the bleeding.

00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:43.037
- Okay.
- Press it.

00:59:46.457 --> 00:59:48.084
There's no time. I'll do it.

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.513
What an outrageous sight.

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.141
They cannot even handle a knife.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.980
He says that the Joseon cooks
lack basic skills.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.525
Basic skills?

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.739
You get ink on your hands
when you first learn to write,

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:20.158
and you are bound to hurt yourself
when cooking.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.453
Since we saw blood,

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.664
it seems that the duck dish
will turn out very well.

01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:29.083
Of course.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.670
If that is what Your Excellency thinks,
who am I to object?

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.798
I will do it.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.762
- Goodness, give it to me.
- I will just do it.

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.680
- Just give it to me.
- Let go!

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.599
How can you do it when I cannot do it?

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.809
- We have no choice. I'll just do it.
- There is no time.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.604
Be careful.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.819
Can you manage with your sore hand?

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.156
My goodness, miss.

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:02.825
You cannot cut anything with that hand.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:04.744
This will not do.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.205
I will try it.

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:09.123
What are you talking about?

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.792
- Not even we--
- Wait.

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.337
Are you sure, Gil-geum?

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.798
Trust me this once.

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:20.677
If I try and fail, you can do it then.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.644
Okay. You do it, Gil-geum.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:30.561
Okay.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:37.193
It looks like
they have given up on this round.

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:48.996
Maid Seo, take over the knife work
in the competition.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.748
What do you mean?

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.166
You have talent.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.336
I will teach you,
so learn how to use a knife.

01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.965
We will remove the skin from the meat.

01:02:05.012 --> 01:02:06.889
Hold the end gently.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.642
Do not use too much force.

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:12.395
Remove the skin only. Just the skin.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.022
That is it.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.400
Do not let it tear.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.073
Next, the scraping.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.286
Stay calm. You are almost there.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.290
Yes. That is exactly it.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.710
Stay calm and focus until the end.

01:02:43.384 --> 01:02:45.178
Well done, Gil-geum.

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:47.930
My legs were shaking so much.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.266
I do not know how I managed.

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:52.143
No, it's fine. You did really well.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.607
Well done, Maid Seo.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.901
And thank you.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.531
You should have stepped up sooner.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.283
Indeed. That was great.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:14.582
{\an8}Cook Maeng, I saw that Gil-geum's hand
became a mess.

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:16.083
{\an8}What happened yesterday?

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:17.919
I am sorry.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.462
For what?

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:20.797
You will lose this competition

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.257
because of me.

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:24.926
What?

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.346
Will you explain so that I can understand?

01:03:28.429 --> 01:03:32.725
I must withdraw from the competition,
but I cannot do so.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.354
Are you being threatened?

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:37.480
Is it the Ming?

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.066
You are.

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.068
It's that sleazy envoy, isn't it?

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:44.403
Do not ask any further.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.033
Is it Kang Mok-ju?

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.206
No, it is not her.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.961
Peking duck tastes best when sliced well,

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.839
and a competition is more entertaining
when there's a twist.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.804
A layer of chewy glutinous rice

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.348
is placed on top of the flattened
and scraped duck skin.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.020
Mixed grains rice,
ginkgo nuts, and pumpkin

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.106
are placed on the lotus leaf.

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.693
Onto that goes the sliced cucumber
and green onion for a refreshing taste.

01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:27.822
It is then wrapped to trap the aroma.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.539
That's rolled up
and cut into bite-sized pieces.

01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:43.045
Thus becomes a golden lotus leaf wrap.

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:46.382
It's garnished with taro mousse

01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:50.428
and served with majiang sauce.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.151
To complete the dish,

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:08.696
it is served with five-colored
lotus roots and refreshing radish.

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:10.865
And that completes the Peking duck rolls.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.998
The dishes from both sides are complete.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.751
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:43.230
First, we will taste the dish
made by the Ming cook, Tang Bailong.

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:44.917
It is truly impressive that he captured
the deep flavors of Joseon in such a way.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:48.963
The subtle but elegant aroma.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.645
The deep and elegant flavor

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:08.649
subtly yet consistently draws me in.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.486
Is this truly the taste of Joseon?

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.364
One mouthful

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:18.451
makes me feel as if
I am being covered by a lotus flower.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.296
How did you create

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.256
the five colors in the braised lotus root?

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:38.054
This is a temple dish

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.598
in which various vegetables of Joseon
are wrapped

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:43.100
and cooked in golden lotus leaves.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.977
As for the five colors,

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:49.106
the red comes from omija,
and it represents benevolence.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:53.652
The yellow comes from gardenia,
and it represents righteousness.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:58.574
The green comes from mulberry leaves,
and it represents propriety.

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:02.953
The black comes from soy sauce,
and it represents wisdom.

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.497
VINEGAR

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.837
Lastly, the white, representing sincerity,

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.839
is the natural color of the lotus root
pickled in vinegar.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:15.633
I see.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.384
Bailong.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:21.931
When did you learn
how to cook Joseon temple fare?

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.022
There was a time…

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:36.695
when I wandered the lands
in search of the ultimate taste.

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.533
However, I could not find such a taste

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.536
and was plagued by torment.

01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:45.788
Back then…

01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:50.126
{\an8}10 YEARS AGO

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:06.225
This cannot be the pulse of a living man.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.727
Homage to the Amitabha Buddha.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.905
You should eat.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.992
At least have some mallow soup.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.785
It is light enough to just drink.

01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:31.333
This is the most delicious soup

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.336
I have ever tasted in my life.

01:09:36.213 --> 01:09:39.800
What is used to make this soup?

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.844
You are not from Joseon.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.513
Please teach me,

01:09:45.097 --> 01:09:46.390
Venerable.

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:52.771
In order to find the ultimate taste,

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:56.150
I traveled to many temples
all around Joseon.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.320
The meal served before you

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:06.452
consists of the dishes I learned
from the venerable monk who saved my life.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.830
Are you saying
you learned how to cook in Joseon?

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:11.123
Yes.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:15.294
I spent around five years in Joseon.

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:22.760
Why did you hide the fact that
you could speak the Joseon language?

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:28.182
He says he never hid it,
and that the Director simply never asked.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:37.691
The rice wrapped in the lotus leaf
shows great wisdom

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.902
as well as depth.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.915
He says the rice is soft and sticky,

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:55.334
and the root is crunchy,
yet chewy and tender.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.760
He says he appreciates
the harmony of the taste and aroma

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:06.345
sealed into each lotus root.

01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:10.015
I am in awe of this food.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:13.894
The result is as clear as day.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:14.853
That is right.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.610
What a touching story.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:24.154
This round won't be easy.

01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:26.782
Although what happened
with the gochugaru was made right

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:28.701
thanks to his great character,

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.286
I don't want to lose either.

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:37.126
Now, it is the Joseon cooks' turn.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.712
Those from the royal kitchen,
step forward.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.344
Now, we will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.557
What is this dish called?

01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:54.852
This is Peking duck.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.730
It's an ancient dish
from the Central Plains,

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.565
often enjoyed by the imperial court.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.027
You can eat the pieces of skin
sprinkled with sugar as is,

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:06.030
and the rolls are to be dipped
in the majiang, a sesame-based sauce.

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.198
Northern Capital roast duck, you say?

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:25.382
He is mocking you,

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:28.010
saying it might be easy to make,
but it is hard to make it taste right.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.602
A crispy and clean taste
with just the right amount of greasiness.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.897
And what is this sweet flavor
that comes through?

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:16.618
No. It is not just sugar.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:23.208
There is more to it.

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:28.046
This is not the roast duck I had
in the imperial court.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.673
It is a completely new taste.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.094
What is more surprising

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:38.098
is that the duck does not at all
smell gamey or earthy.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.692
The majiang sauce

01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:50.444
enhances the nutty and sweet flavor,

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.489
and it goes well with the unique,
clean taste of the roast duck

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:57.576
that it feels as if all three flavors
flood my mouth at once.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.289
The skin is crispy, the meat is moist,

01:15:02.372 --> 01:15:06.835
and together with the shredded
green onion and cucumber,

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:10.339
they create a perfect harmony.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:11.507
This dish…

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.591
It is…

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:15.177
- The greatest taste on the land.
- The greatest taste on the land.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.977
What is the sweetness
infused into the skin

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:25.562
of the roast duck you made?

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.607
It's pumpkin.

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.905
It is a cooking method
I have never heard of before.

01:15:34.988 --> 01:15:39.576
To think that you managed to infuse
the flavor of pumpkin into the skin,

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.163
as expected,
you surely are no ordinary cook.

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:47.292
How can duck meat
be so unbelievably juicy?

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:51.630
You indeed have the skill
befitting a gwinyeo.

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:58.428
This concludes
the tasting of the second round,

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.430
and the evaluation will follow.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:59.656
I will announce
the scores for the second round.

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:40.614
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.699
{\an8}It was my mistake

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.160
{\an8}to risk the future of the nation
on a cooking competition.

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:46.161
{\an8}No.

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:49.456
{\an8}Even if we lose, we should do our best
until the very end.

01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:52.209
{\an8}What if the lid does not arrive in time?

01:17:52.292 --> 01:17:53.502
{\an8}We'll go with Plan B.

01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:55.462
{\an8}This is our opportunity.

01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:57.589
{\an8}If it means we can eliminate
the chief royal cook

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.300
{\an8}and make His Majesty explode with fury.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.344
{\an8}What I say is of the utmost secrecy.

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:03.970
{\an8}Treachery.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:04.930
{\an8}It cannot be.

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.600
{\an8}You want the chief royal cook
as a tribute woman?

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:17.109
