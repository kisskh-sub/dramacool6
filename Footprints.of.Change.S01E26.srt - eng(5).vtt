[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.890
[Episode 26]

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.400
Sue Yu Dongjun!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.370
Sue him!

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.660
From the inside.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.880
Sorry, sorry.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.660
He accuses me of having an affair
with Lu Guoyao.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.340
Lu Guoyao is my distant relative.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.560
He's my boss.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.630
Isn't it normal for us to work together?

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.910
Isn't it normal for us
to go purchase fabric together?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.680
So I can't interact with any men
from now on?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.410
I'm out earning money,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.860
and all he needs to do is cook at home

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.320
and take care of our child.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.780
But what happens? When I get home,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.620
he smashes everything in sight.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.400
16 years.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.840
He got Hua

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.810
to curse at me...

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.320
He called me a slut,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.560
said I was shameless,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.850
and accused me of sleeping with Lu Guoyao.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.230
My...

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.310
my son...

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.280
Why...

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.840
Why do I...

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.400
Why do I...

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.260
Why do I...

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560
Why do I go out and work?

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.860
Ye, I'm...

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.800
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.540
Jiuling.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.860
You can't just brush
the outside of your teeth.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.140
You need to brush the inside too.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.630
Otherwise, your breath will smell.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.290
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.990
Beichuan is a nice guy.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.980
I said, Beichuan is a nice guy.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.190
Don't bully him.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.910
What are you talking about, Jiuling?

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.650
I'm saying you're a shrew.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.100
Don't bully Beichuan. He's a gentle guy.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.400
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.260
Why are you mentioning Beichuan?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.360
I saw you two kissing!

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.779
Jiuling!

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.290
Ye Xining and Xiang Beichuan were kissing!

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.200
You can't even stay quiet
while brushing your teeth?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.060
I'll treat you to lunch, alright?

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.340
Dinner too.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.600
Deal?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.560
Fine, fine, fine.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.090
Just stop talking about it.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.300
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.720
What did you and Jiuling talk about

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.110
after I left yesterday?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.390
Shen and I talked about us.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.490
She didn't just talk about it last night,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.170
but this morning too.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.170
What did she say?

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.620
She said...

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.190
She said I'm like a big stroke of luck

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.070
that landed right in your lap,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.250
and that you should cherish me.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.970
What do you think?

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.000
I think she's right.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.570
What else did she say?

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.920
She talked about you too.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.310
She said...

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.190
"Xiang Beichuan is

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.370
not that great."

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.970
What does that mean?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920
She said you're

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.360
slow-witted,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.600
stubborn,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.360
old-fashioned,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.390
and as dense as a block of wood,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.570
and that I should think carefully
before proceeding.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.280
I was going to argue with her,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.659
but the more I thought about it,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.480
you know, they say, "If you don't
listen to your elders' advice,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.870
you'll soon regret it."

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.120
Are you upset?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.130
No, I'm not.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.840
Are you feeling kind of upset?

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.350
Not at all.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.950
You are upset.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.040
Don't get anxious,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.190
and don't feel bad.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080
You know, I

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.470
only see

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.150
your good qualities.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.900
For example,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.600
you're honest and straightforward.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.190
Being slow-witted just means
you're honest, right?

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.270
You're well-read,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.510
educated, and polite.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.770
You're also virtuous,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.870
gentle,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240
and considerate.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920
That's good then.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.420
Anyway, I only see your good qualities.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.690
As for your flaws,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.350
I can put up with them for now.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.210
You can work on them gradually.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.720
I'll work on them gradually.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.990
See? There's another good quality:

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.320
you're willing to correct your mistakes.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.240
Okay.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.450
By the way,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.030
I have good news for you.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.380
Mr. Zhong told me

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.350
I can return to teaching at the school.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.230
Really?

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.270
Congratulations, Mr. Xiang Beichuan.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.720
You can finally return to
the teaching post you love.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.120
I'm really happy for you.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.010
But how did you manage it?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.150
How did you get the school
to change its stance so dramatically?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.960
Not me.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.480
Several female students in my class

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.090
wrote a joint letter to the school

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.690
and continued sending more,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.050
proving my innocence.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120
Female students?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.710
You're quite popular with the ladies, huh?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.180
Jiuling was right.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.340
You're really not that great.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.690
Why are you getting upset?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.970
Well,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.430
I'm not just popular with women.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.190
I get along well with men too.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.050
Yan Jun's here.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.340
Let's go somewhere else to eat.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.900
No need.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.820
Let's just eat our meal.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.270
Two friends of mine are coming.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.470
I'll go check on them.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.110
You guys came here to eat too?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.440
Come on, join us.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.920
Wouldn't that be awkward?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.720
Not at all.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.000
Is she your girlfriend?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.540
Yes...

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.480
and no.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.000
Well, not exactly...

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.750
Sort of.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.620
How long have you been together?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.320
We just met the day before yesterday.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320
And she's already your girlfriend?

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.360
Sometimes,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.820
nice guys don't always

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.040
get the girl.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.530
Am I right, Xining?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.500
Come on, come join us.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:26.980
Come on.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.789
Let me introduce you to
two friends of mine.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.240
Sit.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.909
Let me make some introductions.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.789
This is

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.080
my college classmate

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.620
and good friend, Xiang Beichuan.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.150
We're so close that...

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.040
at work, I can't even tell
which one of us is the boss.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.130
Don't be silly.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.790
This is Miss Ye Xining.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.720
She is

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.340
a good friend to both of us.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.500
This is Lu Mingming.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.290
Nice to meet you.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.470
Nice to meet you, Miss Ye.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.090
What are you doing?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.210
She is your friend?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.290
She wrote an article about me.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.790
Based on just one photo,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.960
in which I appeared close to a man,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.340
she claimed we were having an affair.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.460
Mr. Lu has a limp,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.750
and I was helping him walk.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.950
Was I wrong to do that?

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.580
You threw dirt at me,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.840
but I only splashed clean water
back at you.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.440
That's not too much, is it?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.400
That's not it, Jun.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.750
Someone previously submitted a story

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.840
about gossip between a boss

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.720
and his female employee.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.000
There were photos included.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.150
Entertainment news, right?

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.260
You know, some people nowadays

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.390
just love reading that kind of gossip.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.720
Here.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.750
Wipe the water off your face first.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.130
This is quite embarrassing.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.260
You should go first.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.010
My hairpin is still in your bedroom.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.670
Buy a new one.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.990
I just want that hairpin.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.980
Leave your hairpin with me

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.150
as a keepsake.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.440
The dishes have barely been touched.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.970
There are sweet and sour ribs
that you love.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.650
I'll order your favorite dishes next time.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.480
Waitress!

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.710
Bring some tableware!

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.510
Right away.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.790
After we finish eating,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.440
let's go upstairs

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.300
and play poker.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.960
Yan Jun,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.130
what was that all about?

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.810
We didn't expect to run into her here.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.000
Xining,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.080
you were being too impulsive just now.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.340
This is a public place.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.030
Besides,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.890
she's Yan Jun's friend after all.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.930
No big deal.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.170
Some friends are closer than others,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.690
just as some relatives are dearer
than others.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.490
Right?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.900
But I never expected that...

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.270
you, Miss Ye,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.360
would have such a fiery side.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.840
That's just how I am—

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.900
straightforward.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.000
It's mainly because she crossed the line.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.630
If she had messed with the person I love,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.720
then I definitely

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.390
wouldn't have let her off that easily.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.270
She crossed me,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.750
and I just splashed her
with a glass of water.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.720
But if it were about someone I love,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.950
I might just smash a bottle over her head.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.150
Don't do that, don't.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.000
If you actually hurt her,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.380
you'd end up at the police station

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.510
and have to pay for her hospital bills.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.830
Next time you encounter
this kind of situation,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.240
try to hold back a little.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.720
Alright, I'll listen to you.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.450
I'll be more careful next time.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.840
Wait, what's going on here?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.770
You're acting like you're dating.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.010
Don't you know?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.340
I have some good news
to share with you officially.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.140
Beichuan and I are together now.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.160
That is great news.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.000
We should celebrate.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.150
Waitress!

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.870
Bring us a bottle of Maotai!

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.800
Right away, sir.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.270
Wait,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.830
that's not necessary.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.230
That's too extravagant.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.310
I'm paying. Don't worry about it.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.450
It's time. I have something else
to attend to.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:43.900
Well,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.740
you two continue celebrating.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.270
Yan Jun, the baijiu...

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.630
Why did he leave?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.680
The baijiu just came.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.250
He probably went to
comfort his girlfriend.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.290
Wait, that's not right.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.440
From what I could tell earlier,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.700
they've probably already broken up.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.070
In the future,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.400
you won't treat me the way
Yan Jun treats his girlfriend,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.230
will you?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.400
What do you mean?

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.790
Like he did.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.600
Xiang Beichuan,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.930
from now on,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.160
you need to take good care of me,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.230
be patient with me,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.000
spoil me,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.510
and indulge me.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.080
Got it?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.480
I got it.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.170
Is it hot?

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.670
I'll feed you too.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.160
Can I peel it?

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.910
No.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.190
You're really eating it?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.510
I'm just teasing you.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.240
Let me peel one for you.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.490
I can do it myself.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.670
Tell me the truth—

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.030
what kind of business
are you really running?

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.080
Labor export.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.510
Labor export?

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.670
What does that mean?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.180
I get them jobs overseas.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.150
Their county is

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.180
extremely poor.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.720
Many strong young men have no work to do.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.910
Families can barely put food on the table.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.440
What I do

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.030
is send them abroad.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.240
This way, they can get jobs,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.870
earn money,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.380
and their families can live better lives.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.610
We're doing something
really meaningful here.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.200
This isn't dangerous, is it?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.600
There's no danger for us.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.000
No,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.960
I mean, is it dangerous for them?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:50.820
I'm helping you make money,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.360
[Longhua Guesthouse]

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.760
and here you are
asking too many questions.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.650
Mr. Yan.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.300
Thank you for your hard work.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300
Is everyone here?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.650
Th-They're all inside.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.200
These are the guys from our county.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.070
Say hello to Mr. Yan!

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.140
-Hello, Mr. Yan!
-Hello, Mr. Yan!

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.690
No need for that, no need.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.620
Everyone, sit down and take a rest.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.020
Mr. Yan,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.610
I-I heard

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.900
that once we get abroad,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.700
your people will take care of us.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.690
Didn't I give you a phone number?

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.020
Call it when you arrive.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.450
That person is my relative.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.210
He will arrange

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.660
everything for you.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.060
Look at Yin and me—

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.450
we're both college graduates.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.300
Look at him,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.970
the scholarly type.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.830
Then look at me,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.450
reeking of money.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.330
Oh, right, Yin,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.730
um...

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.760
overseas,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.800
many people don't speak Chinese.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.900
Director Hu mentioned last time

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.160
that Yin's English is quite good, right?

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.900
After these people arrive there,

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.230
they'll need a translator for daily life.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.060
Please take extra care of them.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.880
D-Don't worry.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.070
My English is fine.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.970
Well then,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.060
when you return,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.140
I'll have Maotai ready

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.270
to welcome you back.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.490
Okay.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.030
You two chat first.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.160
I need to take a call.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.020
Thank you.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.150
That was you I ran into
on the street that day, wasn't it?

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.840
I...

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.980
I actually...

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.680
never went to college.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.140
My family is quite poor.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.060
I just thought we could...

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.640
make more money together.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.460
That time when we met Director Hu,

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.920
why did he bring you along?

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.210
Director Hu just asked me

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.339
to help put on a show,

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.970
p-pretending to be someone educated.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.030
He was afraid y-you'd look down on us.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.099
Alright.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.240
Have a safe journey

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.069
on your trip.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:20.839
Take care of yourself.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.730
Thank you.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.100
Don't bite my dress.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.820
Later,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.350
I have a social event later.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.530
Do I look good?

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.190
Look at that wagging tail.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.290
Let's ask Professor Xiang.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.250
Do I look good?

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.820
Yes, you do.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.750
If you think you look good, then you do.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.050
Did you even look at me

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.510
before saying I look good?

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.050
You look good.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.290
What's wrong?

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.660
You seem upset.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.250
Nothing.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.210
I just...

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.840
didn't sleep well last night.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.290
Well,

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.750
why didn't you sleep well?

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.850
I was tossing and turning all night,
thinking.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:23.690
Maybe today...

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.050
I'd better not go.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.180
But you already promised me.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.730
It's mainly that...

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.480
with so many strangers
on that kind of occasion,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.450
I really don't feel comfortable with it.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.940
You're afraid of crowds?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.050
Professor Xiang,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.340
when you're teaching classes,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.870
aren't there even more people
in front of you?

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.100
It's like this.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.680
Teaching is teaching,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.580
and socializing is socializing.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.980
They're two completely different things.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.010
Teaching

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.290
is my main job,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.860
and those sitting below are all students.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.590
But socializing is different.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.450
There will be so many strangers.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.580
I don't even know what to say to them,

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.460
and it's hard to choose topics.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.250
Whether I talk about serious topics
or keep things light, nothing feels right.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.310
Alright, alright.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.900
You nerd.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.490
You're in teacher mode again,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.290
giving me a lecture, aren't you?

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.060
Alright.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.820
If you don't want to go, then don't.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.450
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.250
But can you...

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.010
come pick me up?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.630
Of course.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.940
I'll definitely come pick you up on time.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.740
That's great.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.020
I just want them to see

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.210
that I have such a handsome
and tall boyfriend.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.610
You can make me look good.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.270
Being able to make you look good...

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.670
might be the only thing I can do.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.380
You're so sweet.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.820
Don't worry.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.640
I'll be on time.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.620
Mr. Liu.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.900
You go ahead, go ahead.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.040
It's been a while since we met.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.210
Mr. Zhu.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.580
Huajing.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.260
Huajing,

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.180
it's been a while
since we had drinks together.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.140
Let's drink more today.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.600
Cheers.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.120
Cheers.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.300
Huajing,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.420
do you know Prosecutor Zhang

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.420
from our city prosecutor's office?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.730
No, I don't.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.900
Then I'll introduce you later.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.900
We're very close.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.490
Great.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.680
Is she here today?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:36.940
That one,

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.100
that tall woman.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.210
What are you looking at?

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.610
Huajing.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:53.970
I have a sister.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.700
Could you look after her for me?

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.200
Which sister are we talking about now?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.580
How do you want me to "look after" her?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.210
Just...

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.690
show her the ropes.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.510
This sis of mine

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.430
just started her business

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.010
and doesn't know anything.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.620
But you know, at times like this,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.220
who she learns from matters.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.290
If I didn't leave her with you,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.620
I'd be really worried.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.690
Look.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.490
That one.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.320
That girl in the red dress.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.140
I'll ask her to come over

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.730
to acknowledge you as her mentor.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.530
Don't, don't.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.690
Wait...

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.490
She doesn't know anything yet.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.620
Aren't you putting me in a tough spot?

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.280
How am I supposed to guide her?

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.290
Huajing,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.790
when I first started in business,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.520
I didn't know anything either.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.050
Take it step by step.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.450
The important thing is...

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.970
finding a mentor like you.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.100
With your guidance,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.870
everything will work out fine.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.420
What's your relationship with her?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420
Nothing special.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.490
She's like a little sister to me.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.900
Please don't read too much into it.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.730
Alright, alright.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.590
No need to explain.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.320
I get it.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.860
You're just going to sit here
by yourself all night?

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.940
It's mainly because there are

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.620
too many people I don't know here.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.820
That doesn't matter.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.490
Just go over and toast with them,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.280
call them brothers,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.780
and you'll get acquainted.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.010
I'm not familiar with them either,

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.870
so I don't know what to talk about.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.980
This is a great opportunity
to build your network.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:22.870
You know, any of these people

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:23.940
might become

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.030
your business partner in the future.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.470
You've met Ms. Shan, right?

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.010
Yes.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.210
I dealt with her once,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.410
but it didn't go well.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.010
No way.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.730
Ms. Shan told me she really likes you.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.660
Really?

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.490
Yes, really.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:44.730
She said

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:45.970
that as soon as she saw you,

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.970
she could tell
you're a very straightforward girl.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.100
She had a good first impression of you.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.860
If it were those people

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.620
who've been around too long in society

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.660
and become complicated,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.520
she would actually dislike them.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.380
She specifically asked me to come over

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.050
and invite you to chat with her.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:22:59.980
She asked for me?

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.010
Yes, she did.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.740
Why else would I have come over?

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.420
Come on, go.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.620
Well, I'm going then.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.210
Hurry up.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.220
Excuse me, sorry to disturb.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.250
My little junior,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.490
you look so beautiful.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.690
That red dress looks great on you today.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.900
Thank you, Ms. Shan.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.140
Ms. Shan,

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.010
last time at the café,

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.900
I said the wrong thing.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.180
I feel quite embarrassed.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.940
Not at all.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:41.860
In my eyes,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.540
you're quite adorable.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.730
Don't overthink it.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.860
You're still

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.860
working for Mr. Lu?

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.960
Yes, I'm still working for him.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:50.970
Mr. Lu

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.300
is really a nice person.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.000
Have you ever thought about changing jobs?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.400
I don't have such plans for now

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.900
because Mr. Lu treats me very well.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.660
You've just entered the business world.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.180
Following the right person
is really important.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.440
I'm not saying Mr. Lu isn't a good person,

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.530
but being honest

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.330
isn't exactly a compliment
in the business world.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.800
Actually, there's someone around you

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.010
who's really good.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.420
Mr. Yan, Yan Jun.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.900
He's so resourceful,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.050
young, and promising.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.050
If you follow him,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.310
you'll definitely advance quickly.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.390
I sincerely hope

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.770
you take the fast track in business

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.670
instead of the long way around.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.210
Thank you, Ms. Shan.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.140
Huajing.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.490
Speak of the devil.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.340
Looks like you two are having a good chat.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.420
My little junior.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.860
This is my senior from the same school.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.500
Ye,

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.160
what's your Chinese zodiac sign?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.890
I'm a Horse.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.650
Huajing is a Tiger.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.640
These two zodiac signs are
most compatible.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.140
Then... then let me toast to you.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.940
Cheers.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.820
It's fate.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.130
Excuse me, I need a word with Mr. Zhu.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:08.770
Sure.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.620
Section Chief Shan.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.660
Miss Ye.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.180
Mr. Yan,

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.290
it's been a while.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.750
It's been a while, Mingming.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.290
By the way,

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.580
I'm not a journalist anymore.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.420
I quit.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.290
Now I work at Mr. Zhu's company

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.570
as the PR manager.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:28.970
Mr. Zhu,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.730
what a coincidence today.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.130
We're all gathered here.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.940
Mingming, we haven't seen each other
for about 2 years, right?

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.400
The last time we met was...

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.880
at the department store, right?

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.490
Time really flies.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:41.770
Indeed.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.690
Feel free to visit our company
when you have time,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.490
and maybe we can collaborate
if there's an opportunity.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.420
No problem.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.180
Welcome to visit my company.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.820
My little restaurant is quite nice.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.200
We can all have a casual meal there.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.680
Great, sounds good.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.750
Come on, cheers.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.970
Looking forward to it, everyone.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.770
Me too, me too.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.230
Looking forward to it.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.000
Mr. Zhu,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.580
would you accompany me
to get something to eat over there?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.120
Okay.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:06.940
Section Chief Shan,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940
please excuse us.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.050
When that girl graduated,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.010
she worked as a proofreader
at a newspaper.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.210
I've seen her before.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.690
She came from a small town

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.100
and was so unsophisticated.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.580
Forget about the Shanghai dialect,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.040
she couldn't even speak Mandarin properly.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.820
But in just a few years,
she completely transformed.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.020
An ugly duckling has turned into a swan.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.580
How do you think she managed to do that?

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:45.620
She slept

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.140
her way to the top.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.960
Mr. Zhu

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.980
will definitely not be her last man.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:54.940
Ms. Shan,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.860
do you think career women's success

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.470
always depends on men?

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.620
Of course not.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.340
A woman can only

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.530
count on herself to succeed.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.390
Well, Huajing,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.490
there's a grown man sitting right here,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.290
and you two...

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.660
How did you manage just now

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.490
to act like you really haven't seen her
for over 2 years?

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.900
Well,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.050
I couldn't just leave a girl
sitting there awkwardly, could I?

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:20.940
Mr. Yan,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.860
well,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.210
looks like
Reporter Lu wouldn't have made it today

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.730
without your help.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.240
How come I didn't know about this?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.860
You've kept it quite secret.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.530
Not at all.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.620
Huajing,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.400
this is why I said you two are compatible.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.620
Ye,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.490
you've been sitting here for,
like, 5 minutes,

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.710
and you've already sold me out.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.190
You're really something.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.280
Alright, I won't chat with you anymore.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.610
You two continue.
I'm going to get a drink.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.720
We made him uncomfortable.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.210
Ms. Shan, I'd like to toast you.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.140
Come on, cheers.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:51.770
Then,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.430
I'll need to learn more from you
in the future.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.030
Hello, who's calling?

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.420
Beichuan,

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.580
it's Yin.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.590
Yin?

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.280
Can we meet downstairs?

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.660
Sure.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.720
See you in a bit.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.340
Yin.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.140
What did you want to see me about today?

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.050
Nothing special.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.850
Come on, Beichuan, let's drink.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:39.970
Thanks.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.270
Come on, Beichuan.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.420
Beichuan...

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.400
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.660
Beichuan,

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.140
they...

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.420
they say you

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.940
and Mr. Yan were classmates.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.010
We were bunkmates.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.420
Could you talk to Mr. Yan for me
and tell him

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.290
that I want to go to Europe?

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.970
They... they said that in Europe,

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.380
laborers earn more money.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.780
O-Once I save enough,
I-I'll go to America.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.140
Of course.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.910
Yin.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.670
There's something
I don't quite understand.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.920
Why do you insist on going to America?

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.860
I...

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.290
I like a girl.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.590
S-She's in America.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.110
And then?

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.820
We were high school classmates
in our county.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.580
I remember

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.100
when I first saw her,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.250
I was stunned.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.770
She's tall

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.420
with big eyes,

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.680
and when she smiles, she has two dimples.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.820
A-And she has fair skin.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.820
Every time I saw her smile,

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.860
I just...

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.180
I just...

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.010
I didn't expect

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.780
you to be quite devoted.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.770
But...

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.340
but my family was poor,

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.450
so I could only go to a junior college.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.940
She...

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.770
she went to university in Shanghai later.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.050
After graduation, she went to America.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.530
P-People in our county say

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.450
that she has a boyfriend now.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.970
I don't know why.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.420
I never even held her hand,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.210
but I

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.580
just want to...

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.690
see her once more.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.210
Maybe...

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.730
I'll finally let go after seeing her.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.340
Yin.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.540
Do you think it's worth it...

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.050
for love?

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.050
I don't really know what love is.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.940
I just know

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.690
I want to see her.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.140
Sometimes I ask myself too—

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.660
is it worth going through

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.530
all this trouble?

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.770
I think...

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.050
it's worth it.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.580
Come on,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.510
let me toast you.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.300
Thank you, Beichuan.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.420
Sir,

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:43.730
we'd like 10 more skewers.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.660
Coming right up!

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:48.780
Huajing,

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.490
after all these years,

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.620
you just keep getting better at drinking.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.050
Can't handle it anymore.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.660
You don't even blush

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.990
and stay as calm as ever.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.310
Allow me, Huajing.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.800
Let me take you home, Huajing.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.920
Mr. Yan, I wouldn't dare ride in your car.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.560
Too many eyes are watching.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.570
But you could give

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.180
Miss Ye a ride.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:05.800
No need.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.080
I have someone to take me home.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.320
My ride is here.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.080
Section Chief Shan, it's been a while.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.320
Is he your boyfriend?

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.710
Yes.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.400
Beichuan.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.660
You've met him before.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.580
Ms. Shan,

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.020
what do you think of him?

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.180
I've been wondering

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.660
what kind of man would be worthy

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.990
of my brilliant junior.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.580
I don't know him well enough to judge.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.490
I can only say

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.620
he's a very lucky man.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.900
I am indeed very lucky.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.690
Is he still working at your company?

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.490
I've always wanted to

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.340
groom him into a businessman

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.690
to make some real money.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.730
But he

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.770
keeps wanting to go back to school

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:43.530
to teach.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.180
You see?

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.510
How much can you make teaching each month?

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.310
It's okay.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.140
We get a base salary

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.490
plus hourly teaching fees.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.690
It's enough to get by.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.260
You two are quite the romantic couple.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.290
Ye,

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.050
you need to ask your boyfriend
to work harder

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.420
and buy you a car soon.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.490
Otherwise, on rainy days,

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.420
he won't be able to come pick you up.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.950
We'll definitely work hard together.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.140
Ms. Shan, we'll be going now.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.860
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:09.650
Goodbye.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.480
Huajing,

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:14.860
please look after

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.790
this sis of mine.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.810
I'm off.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.860
You're not mad at me

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.850
for going out networking tonight, are you?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.530
Of course not.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.040
I don't understand
your business dealings anyway.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.930
I'll definitely buy you a car
in the future.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.010
I'll get you one

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.010
that's better than

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.900
Yan Jun's and Shan Huajing's cars!

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.340
Then you'll have to

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.570
work hard to get your driver's license.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.840
That's too generous of you, Ms. Ye.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.350
In the future, I'll only ride

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.820
in your car and no one else's.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.150
I'll sit in your passenger seat every day.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.380
In the future,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.290
I'll work hard to make money outside.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.050
And you can focus on your writing.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.980
When you become a great writer someday,

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.970
you'd better not forget

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.300
this little darling who provided for you.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.580
If that day really comes

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.530
when I become a famous writer

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.990
and then forget about you,

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.389
wouldn't you hold a knife to my throat?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.699
No way.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.170
I'd only

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.679
crush your bones and scatter your ashes!

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Even more ruthless than I imagined.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.340
Alright, it's getting late.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.650
Hop on the bike.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.530
Please, Ms. Ye,

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.449
take your exclusive seat.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.060
Who is the passenger seat reserved for?

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.090
I was afraid it might be uncomfortable
for you.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.900
Not at all.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.050
My butt has plenty of padding.
I won't feel a thing.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.780
I'll take your passenger seat.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.260
Then sit tight.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.420
Let's go!

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.650
[Echoes of Time]

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.860
Please turn your books

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.300
to page 15.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.090
Everyone, it's important to note

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.040
that the development of New Era literature

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.810
began after 1976,

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.740
centered on the development

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.970
and creative work of Chinese writers.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.410
Xining,

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.130
this batch of goods was inspected

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.780
at the factory before shipping.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.340
What is there to worry about?

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.450
Several batches of wool sweaters

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.650
were in perfect condition
during the factory inspection,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.860
but when the goods reached the buyers,

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.780
they reported defective products,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.720
and not just a few.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.500
So the problem must have occurred

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.490
somewhere between the factory
and the dock.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.260
Some people will do anything for money,

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.420
no matter how shady.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.440
They must have tampered with
the goods somehow.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.690
They're all moldy.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.090
Mr. Lu.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.860
Please come take a look.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:04.970
What's wrong, Ye?

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.280
They're all moldy.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.420
Two whole boxes.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.130
Since we've found the moldy ones,

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.260
just get rid of them.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:13.340
Let it go.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.720
How can we just let it go?

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.740
What if this happens again?

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.090
They're all long-term clients.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.610
I know why they did this.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.490
Why?

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.130
Ye.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.620
You've never run a factory.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.530
Running a manufacturing business
is very tough.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.490
We need to find

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.640
a mutually beneficial approach.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.650
What kind of mutual benefit?

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.050
Give up a little profit here and there

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.940
so we can secure hard-to-get goods.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940
If you do the math,

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.490
it's still worth it.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.860
Mr. Lu,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.170
I've noticed

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.220
that your business approach and philosophy

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.820
are becoming more like someone else's.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.130
Are you copying him?

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.010
Copying who?

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.380
The guy next door.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.000
It's business.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.570
All businesspeople are like this.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.900
That guy next door isn't
a good role model.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.090
Why not?

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.380
In business, Yan Jun has

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.820
very low standards

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.050
and poor principles,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.450
yet he's got thick skin.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:09.420
Ye,

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.970
that doesn't sound like a compliment.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.740
If you stay in business long enough,

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.490
you might end up the same way.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:18.260
I won't.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.620
I don't copy others.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.490
I am who I am,

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.420
Ye Xining.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.000
That's all for today's class.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.900
There's one more thing

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.760
I need you all to pay attention to.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.190
Starting today,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.170
when you come to see me
in my office after class—

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.560
whether you're male or female students—

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.340
you need to come in pairs.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:47.930
Please keep this in mind.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.260
Alright,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.100
that's all for now.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.100
Class dismissed.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.070
Just wear it.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.170
Bye-bye!

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.170
It's easy to make money off foreigners.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.650
Jiuling.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.460
Do you know about the shady dealings

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.860
between Mr. Lu

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.690
and that sweater manufacturer?

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.670
Shady business?

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.650
I don't know. What happened?

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.700
Let me tell you, the company is
so unprofessional.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.520
If he keeps playing these games,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.970
something bad will happen sooner or later.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.380
No, he's not playing games,

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.610
and the company is not
unprofessional either.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.170
With such a big thing happening
in his family,

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.430
he must be distracted.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.530
What happened

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.490
to his family?

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.390
You don't know?

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.230
No, I don't.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.390
I don't spill secrets.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.940
This stays only between you and me.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.420
He got divorced.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.900
Wasn't he getting along pretty well
with his wife?

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.220
They were childhood sweethearts
with a son and a daughter.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.380
How could they divorce?

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.170
That's just what they showed to outsiders.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.370
All those little domestic problems...

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.050
The real reason is...

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.230
I can't tell you.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.380
Come take a look at these jeans!

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.100
Where was I?

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.530
You were saying

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.070
it was all for show.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:26.780
Right.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.820
Take a look, come on.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.340
How much are they?

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.700
-90 yuan.
-90 yuan per pair.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.560
Too expensive. I don't want them.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.910
Come back next time!

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.000
The real reason is

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.350
that he's been
neck-deep in debt now, right?

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.890
He couldn't pay that back at all.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.350
So he borrowed money
from his wife's family.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900
All the extra money.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.660
And then?

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.740
Two years later, he still couldn't
pay them back.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.800
They'd had enough.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.630
His mother-in-law came to his house,
making a scene.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.890
She sat on the floor and cried.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.390
His brother-in-law
scratched his face badly—

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.450
blood everywhere. Very terrifying.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.220
Wait, Ye Xining.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.010
You were trying to get me
to spill the beans, weren't you?

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.740
No, I wasn't.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.130
You said it yourself.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.090
I didn't.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.650
You said it yourself.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.450
I didn't!

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.340
You said all of it.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.260
What did I say?

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:07.940
You said

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.490
his brother-in-law scratched his face,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.970
and his mother-in-law

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:12.970
was crying there.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.090
Did I say that?

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.440
Ye Xining, if you weren't tricking me,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.900
I wouldn't have said any of this.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.530
You cunning woman,
trying to pump me for information.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.940
You...

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.370
I can't outsmart you.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.970
Well, what's the deal

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.420
with Mr. Lu and that manufacturer?

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.490
Two boxes in the batch of goods

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.130
he gave to me are defective,

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.080
and he wants me to mix them
with the good ones and sell them.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.000
Defective products?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.270
Keep your voice down.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.980
Or the whole street will know later.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.710
With that big mouth of yours...

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.900
Does he know

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.010
about the defective ones himself?

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.010
He definitely...

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.420
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.010
Are you thirsty?

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.350
How about I go buy you a bottle of water?

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.630
Buy me a popsicle then.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.820
Cream or red bean?

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.700
Cream is fine.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.310
That one's more refreshing.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.090
Most people have fried dough sticks

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:02.690
with soy milk for breakfast.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.270
Why do you have fried dough sticks
with rice balls?

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.390
Carbs with carbs.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.020
These aren't enough for me!

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.820
Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.820
You think I'm fat?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.630
No.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.170
Just by looking,

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.100
you're probably around 55 kg.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.270
Are you blind?

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.130
Pick me up!

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.160
We're in public.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.630
Hugging or cuddling isn't appropriate.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.360
Just pick me up when I ask you to!

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.310
I take back what I just said.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.780
You're not 57.5 kg.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.600
How much then?

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.420
Just around 54.5 kg.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.720
Xiang Beichuan, you're such a jerk!

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:40.420
Alright, alright.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.340
I was wrong, okay?

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.540
I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:48.640
Jerk,

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.340
[Women's Status and Choices
Amid the Market Economy Boom]

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.860
isn't this your paper?

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.950
This jerk's paper got published.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:55.610
Sir,

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.870
I'll take 10 copies.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:58.860
Why buy so many?

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.010
Can you even read them all?

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.420
I'll give them to others as gifts.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.130
Come on,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.690
we don't need to be
all vain about this, right?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.190
You're not vain?

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:07.700
You don't want to be famous?

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.700
Honestly,

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.490
being famous or not

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.190
doesn't really matter much to me.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.260
My main task is

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.900
to write down my observations as papers

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.050
so readers can read them.
That's enough for me.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:17.970
I'm vain.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.700
When you publish a book, I'm proud.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.940
It's like, "If one of us
becomes wealthy and successful someday..."

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.990
We'll definitely forget about each other.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.120
Don't talk to me for the rest of the day!

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.860
Why are you mad?
