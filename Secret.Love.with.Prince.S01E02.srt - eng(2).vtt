00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:16.434
Yes, come on in.

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.082
Oh, Matsuri!

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.133
You came. Thanks!

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.227
- Here's a little gift.
- Wow, really!

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.464
Thanks. Looks delicious!

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.471
Looks delicious!

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:35.889
Wait, where's Azusa?

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:37.317
What?

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:39.312
Not again.

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:42.165
Before any performance,
he always finds a place to be alone.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.895
Yeah.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.026
Azusa, here's a snack for you.

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:54.637
Your favorite croissant sandwich.

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.345
Matsuri, thank you.

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:12.209
Are you perhaps too nervous to eat?

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.756
Nope.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.130
I know you'll give your best
like you always do.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.641
As your sister,
I'm rooting for your talent in Terzetto!

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:33.660
Well, even if it's just me vouching for you,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.110
you're going to be all right.

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:46.389
Matsuri, do you always stick your nose
in other people's business like this?

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.857
Huh?

00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:50.345
What if...

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.346
What if I liked you, Matsuri,
what would you do then?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.052
I know my place.

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.671
Do your best tonight.

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.487
Here.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.506
Whoa!

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:34.341
So many people showed up just to see Terzetto!

How about binding you with our love?

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:12.641
Are you ready to spend
the best evening with us?

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.922
Awesome!

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:19.715
Amazing!

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:31.489
What if I liked you, Matsuri?

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.027
That was obviously a joke.

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:39.719
No way someone cool like him
would want to be with someone like me.

00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:46.523

Apologies. We are currently
experiencing a power outage.

00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:12.898

- Is it going to be canceled?
- What? No way!

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.100
Come on! I came all the way from Okinawa!

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:47.916
Go, Terzetto, you can do it!

00:04:56.073 --> 00:04:58.286
Haruka!

This is amazing.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.274
Feels so surreal.

00:05:52.274 --> 00:05:55.737

­[Secret Love with Prince]

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.207
Thank you for today.

00:07:18.207 --> 00:07:22.929
Really. Why thank me? I enjoyed it even more.

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:26.222
Accept my apology instead, then.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.398
Huh? Why are you sorry?

00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:33.488
If I apologize honestly, will you forgive me?

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:35.825
What?

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:40.184
I'm sorry.

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:43.823
I ended up falling for you, Matsuri.

00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:49.277
I can't see you as just a sister anymore.

00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:54.213
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:56.559
What?

00:07:57.167 --> 00:08:03.181
Wait. Did he just confess his love to me?

00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:06.650
Azusa of Terzetto just said he loves me?

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:19.396
Good morning, Matsuri.

00:08:20.076 --> 00:08:21.734
Huh?

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:26.170
Sorry, Haruka.
Sorry for such a weird reaction.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.269
What's troubling you?

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:30.583
You can tell your brother. I'm all ears.

00:08:31.382 --> 00:08:35.121
I am glad you want to, but I can't say anything.

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:39.456
Is it possibly a love problem?

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:42.343
Huh? What the... Come on! Tell us.

00:08:42.343 --> 00:08:44.443
Who is he? Where is he from?

00:08:46.999 --> 00:08:49.299
All right, that's enough.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.507
Why don't you hurry and get changed?

00:08:51.507 --> 00:08:53.395
You'll be late for school.

00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:55.468
Oh, right. Crap!

00:09:03.514 --> 00:09:07.227
Matsuri, you don't need to say anything.

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:09.800
If you only think of me as a brother,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.560
then we'll leave it at that. Don't worry about it.

00:09:15.523 --> 00:09:18.630
Even if you say not to worry about it...

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:22.590
If you say so, let's just forget it,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.190
and go back to being siblings as before.

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:27.268
What are you saying?

00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:32.455
There's no way we can go back
to how things were before.

00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:34.874
Huh?

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:40.562
Even now, I feel like I want to hug you like this.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.406
What?

00:09:55.038 --> 00:09:58.520
If things aren't the same as before,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.940
does that mean I'm no longer your sister?

00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:12.652
It's not like I'm going to
stop being your brother, Matsuri.

00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:14.679
Huh?

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:19.965
It's just that being only siblings
is no longer enough.

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:26.281
So, it's okay.

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:29.337
I'll still do my duties as your big brother.

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:39.868
I don't understand it.

00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:42.855
I really don't get it.

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:02.435
I knew you'd be here.

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:05.749
You don't seem like yourself today.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.863
Let's head home together.

00:11:07.863 --> 00:11:10.184
Rihito, how did you find this place?

00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:14.031
Well, the world is quite convenient these days.

00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:15.324
What?

00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:19.423
Then I can always find your location.

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:22.634
- Huh?
- The power of love.

00:11:23.464 --> 00:11:24.993
Oh.

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:27.239
That's a crime. I'm going to report you.

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:29.734
Matsuri!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.765
I guess this is what I really like
about being with my brothers.

00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:39.471
What's for dinner today?

00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:42.496
- Plain rice and salt for today.
- No! That's lame!

00:11:42.496 --> 00:11:43.632
Rihito?

00:11:43.632 --> 00:11:45.666
- Subaru!
- Hey there.

00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:49.841
Wait! Is that the handsome actor,
the national crush, Subaru?

00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:52.300
What? Is he real?

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.002
Matsuri?

00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:56.595
Huh?

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.772
What?

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:02.484
Wow! It's really you, Matsuri!

00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:06.912
What? I... uh...

00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:13.072
No way, don't tell me you've forgotten
your beloved "big brother".

00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:14.572
What?

00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:18.406
What is he saying?

00:12:22.837 --> 00:12:24.857
Matsuri.

00:12:27.374 --> 00:12:29.270
No way!

00:12:30.108 --> 00:12:32.015
I have something to give you.

00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:35.034
Meeting you here must be fate.

00:12:35.034 --> 00:12:39.194
Call me like you used to, Matsuri.

00:12:41.503 --> 00:12:43.772
Subaru?

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.169
Gosh!

00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:48.974
- It's been ages since we met.
- Please, put me down!

00:12:48.974 --> 00:12:51.005
Why are you acting so formal?

00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:55.035
You used to cling to me,
chanting my name all the time.

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.627
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

00:12:57.627 --> 00:13:00.813
Wait, how come you two are together?

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.128
She's my sister.

00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:06.497
Matsuri's mom and our dad got remarried.

00:13:06.497 --> 00:13:11.798
So, now Haruka, Azusa, and I
are Matsuri's brothers.

00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:13.812
Oh, really.

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:18.260
Then can I borrow your little sister
for a little bit?

00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:20.959
Huh?

00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:28.318
How have you been?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.984
I still can't believe it.

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:34.586
My brother Subaru is now such a famous actor.

00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:39.929
And that you remember me.

00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:43.314
You used to say that too, right?

00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:48.140
You're everyone's prince,
so why do you care about me?

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.486
Because everyone just adored you.

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:56.050
You are Richie Rich.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.778
Your world was totally different from mine.

00:13:58.778 --> 00:14:02.242
Yet you always looked after me.

00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:05.518
You haven't changed at all.

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:08.558
It's the same Matsuri I knew from before.

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:18.660
Because you were always with me,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.440
I don't think I ever felt lonely back then.

00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:28.263
It brings back so many memories.

00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:42.386
You are mine, after all.

00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:49.232
You are mine, you know.

00:14:59.446 --> 00:15:01.462
Erm...

00:15:03.645 --> 00:15:05.225
You must be tired.

00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:08.103
Huh? What are you saying?

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:14.645
You only said those words when you were tired.

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:17.846
So, I guess...

00:15:23.087 --> 00:15:27.898
Matsuri, can you say that for me?

00:15:27.898 --> 00:15:29.418
Huh?

00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:31.568
Say what?

00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:34.621
That you love Subaru the most in the world.

00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:38.680
Huh?

00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:41.428
No, no, no!

00:15:41.428 --> 00:15:45.501
Who do you love the most in the world?

00:15:46.743 --> 00:15:51.887
In the world... Suba...

00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:55.906
I've fallen for you, Matsuri.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.234
Wait.

00:16:00.536 --> 00:16:03.186
Huh? Why am I...

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:08.756
Matsuri, I'm going to debut as an idol.

00:16:09.586 --> 00:16:10.968
What?

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.832
Through the same agency as Terzetto.

00:16:15.523 --> 00:16:19.268
Current idols are the princes, right?

00:16:23.493 --> 00:16:25.648
Look forward to seeing me on stage.

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:29.367
Yeah.

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:49.095
See you later.

00:17:00.178 --> 00:17:04.777
I'll become a real prince
and protect you, Matsuri.

00:17:04.777 --> 00:17:06.057
Promise?

00:17:06.057 --> 00:17:07.605
Yes.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:17.249
Matsuri, do you remember
the promise I made?

00:17:21.902 --> 00:17:23.475
What are we having for dinner today?

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.945
I heard it's just plain rice and salt.

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.999
What? Just rice?

00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:30.635
That explains it.

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:52.983
I won't give her to anyone randomly.

00:17:53.748 --> 00:17:55.868
What?

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.896
Subaru, what are you doing?

00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:02.695
You're the worst.

00:18:03.945 --> 00:18:06.859
- Matsuri!
- Matsuri!

00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:12.261
My bad, Azusa.

00:18:20.124 --> 00:18:24.282
What was that? What got into him?

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.411
Azusa!

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.967
Do you need to use the bathroom?
Go ahead.

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:37.747
I just need to dry my hair.

00:18:37.747 --> 00:18:41.634
Can I do that for you?

00:18:41.634 --> 00:18:43.214
Huh?

00:18:43.214 --> 00:18:44.754
That.

00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:49.425
This?

00:18:55.376 --> 00:18:59.069
Azusa, I can do the rest myself.

00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:02.600
I've been thinking all along...

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.520
about how I can supersede Subaru's kiss.

00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:10.928
Supersede?

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.738
Relax, I won't force you.

00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:21.536
Because I don't want you to hate me.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:28.124
So, if you don't like it, just say it.

00:19:28.124 --> 00:19:30.336
And I'll stop.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.673
Huh?

00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.485
What do you mean?

00:19:45.132 --> 00:19:47.382
Is this okay?

00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:50.901
Azusa...

00:20:03.829 --> 00:20:06.103
Then how about this?

00:20:10.618 --> 00:20:12.418
Matsuri.

00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:17.024
You have to clearly say if you don't like it.

00:20:23.232 --> 00:20:27.157
If you don't, I might actually kiss you.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.518
It's late.

00:20:49.771 --> 00:20:53.283
What?

00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:57.315
What should I do?

00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:14.953
The only place of comfort is school now.

00:21:14.953 --> 00:21:18.035
Which one do you like more, Matsuri?

00:21:18.943 --> 00:21:20.728
Whoa!

00:21:21.267 --> 00:21:23.467
What in the world is this?

00:21:23.467 --> 00:21:27.759
We're doing a popularity poll
and it's super close.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:30.280
That's kind of...

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.335
Which one do you think is the ideal prince?

00:21:56.536 --> 00:21:58.256
Uh oh!

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.913
I think you dropped this.

Oh!

00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:14.132
You're such a klutz.

00:22:20.387 --> 00:22:22.798
I really wanted to see you all this time.

00:22:24.483 --> 00:22:27.310
I've made my peace with being your brother
for the rest of my life,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.680
as long as I can be your first.

00:22:31.492 --> 00:22:35.330
But if that's being taken away,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.970
I won't hold back anymore.

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:43.700
I won't stop until you say that the perfect
brother and the perfect prince

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.360
are both me.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.886

Matsuri, what's your relationship
with that sparkling guy?

00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:14.645
- Nothing in particular.
- Don't tell me he's your first love.

00:23:15.742 --> 00:23:20.133
Since you won't be seeing him,
should I hang a sign here?

00:23:20.863 --> 00:23:22.555
A sign?

00:23:22.555 --> 00:23:27.228
Yes. Something to say that Matsuri belongs to us.

00:23:28.568 --> 00:23:30.342
