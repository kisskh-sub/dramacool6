[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.630
[Episode 28]

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.430
Mr. Zhong.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.920
I heard the housing allocation for
the apartment building has been announced.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920
They rejected me.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.509
They gave it to Xiang Beichuan.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.150
Why?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.400
This is so unfair.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.000
Everyone knows

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.530
I've been married for years

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.120
and finally expecting a child.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.000
I desperately need that apartment now.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400
Why give it to him?

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.830
He's not even married

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.040
and hasn't taught for over a semester.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.190
Is it just because

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.790
he gave you all those shirts?

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:19.680
Fine.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.600
I'm returning this to you now.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.700
You said it was good quality.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.870
It shrank after one wash

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.520
and doesn't even fit anymore.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.240
Mr. Guo.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.470
Silk shirts do shrink after washing.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.560
Don't try to fool me.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.690
You think I've never worn silk before?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.050
Mr. Guo, wait.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.310
How did you know
the apartment was assigned to me?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.800
I don't even know about it myself.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.630
That's right.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.280
The housing list
goes through several rounds of selection.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.290
The first round hasn't even started yet.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.480
Who told you this?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.430
Zhang from the boiler room

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.470
at our faculty's public bathhouse.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.030
How could you believe Zhang?

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.750
He's just a boiler operator after all.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.370
What's wrong with being a boiler operator?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.700
He's been operating boilers
at our school for over 20 years.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.190
This Zhang...

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.360
Anyway,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.210
if I'm not on the list
for the apartment allocation,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.870
no one else will get it either.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.560
Mr. Guo.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.880
Where are you going?

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.260
I'm going to ask Zhang for clarification.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.180
Who is it?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.920
Who's there?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.840
Huajing.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.870
Why are you here?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.400
Huajing, I heard you weren't feeling well.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.760
I came to check on you.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.680
Come in, please.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.670
Have a seat.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.680
How did you know where I live

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.470
and that I was sick?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.150
Yan Jun told me.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.070
I thought so.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.310
Not many people know about my place.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.630
Why would he tell you about this?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.070
Huajing.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.680
Do you have a cold

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.750
or a fever?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.600
Is it serious?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.510
It's not serious, just a minor cold.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.240
I'm fine now.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.460
Perfect.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.310
I brought you some fruit.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.750
Eating more fruit while you're sick

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.870
helps supplement your vitamins.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.950
Thank you.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.800
Good.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.680
Have some water.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.880
You're here

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.190
because you need something, right?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.450
I don't need anything.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.630
The other day I went to the mall

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.480
and saw a beautiful necklace.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.890
I thought

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.080
it would suit you perfectly.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480
So I bought it right away.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.330
It's for you.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.090
Is it expensive?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.050
Not expensive.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.690
It looks beautiful.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.270
[Amber necklace 1388]

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.210
And you say it's not expensive?

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.050
Do you want something from me?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.480
I don't want anything from you.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.320
I just think this necklace

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.340
looks especially beautiful on you.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.880
Don't worry, Huajing.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.060
Please accept it.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.190
I really don't want anything from you.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.200
All right.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.070
Then I'll accept it.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.350
I really like it.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.720
Thank you.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.480
Stay for dinner.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.950
I'll skip dinner.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.270
I have some work at the company.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.390
I need to go back.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.210
That's fine.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
I won't keep you then.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.830
You know where I live now.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.960
Come visit anytime.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.760
No problem.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.000
I'll definitely come visit you often.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.830
Huajing, eat more fruit.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.830
Drink more water.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720
And get plenty of rest.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.430
Sure thing.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.870
Okay, I won't disturb you anymore.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.930
I'll head back now.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.800
Okay.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.360
You don't need to see me out.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.000
I can find my way.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.120
I won't see you out then.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.380
Take care of yourself.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.160
Take care.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.870
Do you even act like a boss?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.600
You're goofy

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.360
and out of it all the time.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.490
You just took off in your little plane,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.360
leaving me and Ye Xining behind.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
A boss who doesn't act like one.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.159
Now we're the ones acting like bosses,

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.820
cleaning up your mess all day.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.430
Do you know how we sold that merchandise?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.630
Piece by piece at Qipu Road,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.560
selling day and night without rest.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.920
If only I'd known you were running off.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.659
We were worried something happened to you.

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.240
I was afraid you'd died
somewhere out there.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.840
Not even a single phone call.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.630
Thankfully, there was Mr. Yan.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.870
That's the only reason
you can see us today.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.050
Otherwise, we'd still
be stuck at Qipu Road.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.270
But you know what?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.430
That Mr. Yan

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.360
took half our merchandise.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560
You know why?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.720
He's got a thing for Ye.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.870
Otherwise, who would take half our goods?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.000
Why would he be so nice to us, right?

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.760
The way he looks at Ye,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.000
it's kind of...

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.870
You know what I mean.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.240
Don't you get it?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.400
What are you laughing at?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.630
So flippant.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.810
I'm telling you, this is serious.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.659
You're really something...

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.600
Mr. Lu?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Ye.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.920
I'm sorry.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.190
Did you also think I ran away?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.800
I did kind of think that way.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.980
He didn't run away.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.120
In fact, he

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.390
brought back
a big order from Eastern Europe.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.120
What's this big order about?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.840
Well, in Europe
they have this thing called...

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.510
Halloween.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.070
Halloween.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.000
Yes, Halloween.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.480
It's basically like

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.630
the Chinese Ghost Festival.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.270
You understand?

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.670
It's that Western thing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.190
On that day, they dress up

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.480
in all kinds of strange costumes,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.600
wear tall hats,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600
put on masks,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.240
wear capes,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.270
and clothes with skeleton patterns.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.510
Then they go out and

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.270
run around in groups.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.660
But making these costumes over there

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.920
is very expensive.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.750
We can make them cheaper here.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.600
So Mr. Lu secured this order

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.510
to make these costumes back home.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.549
After they're made, we'll ship them back.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.669
That's the whole thing, right?

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.669
What's it called?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.150
OEM production.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.240
Yes, OEM.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.360
So these goods

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.150
are specifically
for the European Halloween.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:44.970
That's right.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.150
If we miss the Halloween deadline,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.260
our losses will be enormous.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.150
So,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.840
in this matter,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.910
the key is to win over Shan Huajing.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.370
As long as customs clears us

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.930
without delay, everything will be fine.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.670
Xining,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.580
how's your relationship with Ms. Shan now?

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.910
Ms. Shan treats me very well

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.360
and has introduced me to many connections.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.630
She can help me with small matters,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.810
but with something this big...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I'm not sure

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.600
if she'll help me.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.770
So you're saying

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.480
this matter still has some risk.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.390
Can we do it or not?

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.750
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.910
Let's do it.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.480
We'll

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.810
trust you one last time.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.360
Lu Guoyao,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.840
if you mess things up again...

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.270
Yan Jun is waiting for us.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.510
We can start working right now.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.600
It's your call.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.030
Alright.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.150
Beichuan.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.770
What's the matter, Mr. Guo?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840
Professor Xiang.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.480
I've confirmed with

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.370
Zhang from the boiler room.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.500
The apartment will be assigned to you.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.340
I believe what he said.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.410
I just wanted to ask you

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.320
if you would consider
giving it to me instead.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.290
Why should I give it to you?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.120
Let me be honest with you.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.390
My wife and I

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.470
have been assigned

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.480
to our school since graduation.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.080
All these years of marriage,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.780
we've been living in separate dormitories.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.670
You know our salaries,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.520
just that little money each month.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.320
We simply can't afford
to buy commercial housing.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.810
You're different.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.530
You're not married yet.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.720
You're an excellent young teacher

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.120
with many opportunities in the future

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.850
and many possibilities ahead.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.330
When we got married,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.240
my mother-in-law
didn't approve of her marrying me.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.240
She thought I had no money, no house,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.630
that her daughter
would suffer by marrying me.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.420
Our baby is due soon.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.240
If I can't get this apartment,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.480
I'll lose all face with her family.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.750
So please, Professor Xiang,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.480
could you help me?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.030
When our school assigns housing again,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.160
I'll do everything to help you get one.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.520
I may not be able to get that apartment.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.790
Why?

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.840
Didn't you say you're the most experienced

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.970
and they'll definitely give it to you?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.400
I gave it to someone else.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.750
Who did you give it to?

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.890
I gave it to Guo Xiaoxu.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.650
How could you be such a jerk?

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.790
Don't be angry.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.390
I was wrong.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.390
It's a big deal.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.480
Before you make a decision,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.200
you didn't even ask my opinion?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.240
From now on, no matter what I do,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.200
I won't discuss anything with you.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.270
Tomorrow I'll take another man

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.800
to go shopping for clothes.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.510
I know I was wrong.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.350
I'm sorry.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.210
Of course you should be sorry.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.260
Just hurry up and eat your food.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.400
Don't smack your lips.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.090
Here, Section Chief Shan.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.210
Let me toast to you.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.960
I'd like to formally introduce her.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.910
This is my dear sister, Miss Ye.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.600
This is Director Liu
from the leather factory.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.510
80% of leather jackets on the market

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.770
come from his factory.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.630
If you need anything in this area,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.560
just ask Mr. Liu.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.780
Guaranteed quality at great prices.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.510
Section Chief Shan's sister
is like my own sister.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.320
Miss Ye,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.360
whenever you need to stock up,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360
come directly to me.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
We can negotiate a good price.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.840
Come, cheers!

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.510
Sure, Sir.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.240
Come.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.480
Ms. Shan.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.840
Where is Mr. Yan?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.890
He said his stomach was bothering him.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.950
He's avoiding drinks on the balcony.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
I'll go check on him.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.720
Okay.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.270
Sir, I'm stepping out for a moment.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.080
You all continue drinking.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.960
Okay.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.510
Mr. Yan,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.510
is your stomach feeling better?

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.120
It's nothing.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.910
I've just

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.050
been drinking too much lately.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.210
You should drink more hot water then.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.550
You've changed a lot.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200
What do you mean?

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.200
Back then, whenever you came
to occasions like this,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.860
you would just sit there alone

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.840
without moving.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.000
But now look at you,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.240
chatting everywhere you go

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.570
and talking to everyone.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.740
Not bad now.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.790
I know Beichuan very well.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.000
Back in college, the two of us

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.060
were best friends.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.110
As for me,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.490
I was quite poor back then.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.960
When I went to the cafeteria,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.240
I could only afford two vegetable dishes

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.970
and didn't dare order any meat.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.030
Every time,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.650
Beichuan would lend me his meal tickets.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.840
What I'm trying to say is,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.630
you've changed so much,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360
but Beichuan

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.290
has stayed exactly the same.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.360
So,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.550
doesn't this affect

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.720
your relationship?

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.920
It doesn't affect us at all.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.790
I went to a bookstore the other day.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.390
I read a book there

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.390
and it said

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.000
that in relationships,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.030
objective circumstances

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.690
affect subjective feelings.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.600
What does that mean?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.250
It means

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.630
when one person changes

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.130
and the other doesn't,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.570
it's very problematic.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.500
This change refers to

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.320
when one person progresses

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.670
and the other doesn't.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.440
Then these two people

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.800
are probably destined
to break up sooner or later.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.170
I didn't expect you
to visit bookstores, Mr. Yan.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.030
I don't buy into that theory.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.560
I believe

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.790
that human emotions

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.030
are guided by subjective consciousness.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.320
And my view on relationships

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320
is idealistic.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.960
Maybe.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.760
Beichuan is idealistic too.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.510
But from what I've observed,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.840
among my friends,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.840
once they get money, they change.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.120
And once they change,
relationships fall apart.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.910
Of course,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.150
you and Beichuan

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.390
might be the exception.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.780
I wish you both happiness.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.340
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.670
Beichuan!

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.960
Xiang Beichuan.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.600
Mr. Lu.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.410
Long time no see.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.080
It's been a while.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.630
Have you eaten? Sit down and join me.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.430
No, I haven't.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.870
I just came down to order.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.600
They'll send the food up later.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.240
It's been so long.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.640
Indeed, long time no see.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.220
You've been doing well lately?

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.840
Very good.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.630
How are you? Busy, I imagine?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.750
Yes, busy.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.620
I've been busy all day.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.680
Finally got a moment to grab a bite.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.840
That's tough.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.880
How are things

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.790
with Ye?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.010
We're doing great.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.200
Good.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.329
Ye is

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.910
quite a remarkable girl.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.560
She did well when she was

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.640
working for the SOE.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.270
And now in our private company,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.160
she's like a fish in water.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.910
She has this drive about her.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.160
It's that kind of

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.750
fearless determination.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.510
How do they say it in trendy terms?

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.660
She's someone

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.960
who can keep up
with the tide of the times.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.510
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lu.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.590
Not at all.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.240
It's your girlfriend,

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.960
Ye, who has been helping us.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.000
Mr. Lu.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.830
Is Ye still frequently going to customs?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.860
Yes, she is.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:53.780
Let me tell you.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.640
Shan Huajing is such a difficult woman.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.160
But now Ye has developed
an excellent relationship with her.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.890
All of our customs-related business

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.090
is handled by Ye.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.200
You're one lucky guy.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.640
In the future,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.680
you can just teach at the school

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.180
and work on your research.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.750
All external matters
can be entrusted to Ye

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.310
without any concern.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.170
Make sure you don't miss out

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.110
on such a good girl.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.420
Would you like some water?

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.080
No, thanks.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.240
Mr. Lu, please enjoy your meal.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.880
I have some matters to attend to.
I'll be going now.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.410
Alright.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.200
Enjoy your meal.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.310
Let me see you off.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.200
No, no, no.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.440
Go back to your meal.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.200
Goodbye.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.550
See you.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.510
Goodbye.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.830
Everyone's busy?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.270
Busy.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.650
Look at this.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.400
Is it nice?

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.060
This hat looks good.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:49.610
Nice.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.490
This thing. Come on, try it on.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.030
What is this?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.860
I would look like Zorro with it on.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.240
It works. Keep it on.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.950
It looks better on
than off, right, Xining?

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.380
Wearing this blocks my eyes.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.550
That's exactly why it looks good on you.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.160
Ye.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.070
Our containers are all ready.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.550
How's it going?
Did you sort things out with customs?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.590
Not yet.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.650
I haven't talked to Ms. Shan about it.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.000
Why haven't you talked to her yet?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.790
Aren't you two getting along well now?

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.070
Calling each other sister and all.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.960
Go talk to her.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.600
It's not that simple.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.550
I get it.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.750
She keeps business
and personal matters separate.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.030
Life is life, work is work.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.170
How about this?

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.920
I'll give you two boxes of eggs.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.160
Take them to visit her.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.420
She doesn't need that.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.830
She's been to all
the fancy restaurants in Shanghai.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.720
Exactly.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.790
She's a section chief, a big shot.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.150
She's eaten
at every restaurant in Shanghai.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.550
As if she'd want your eggs.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.640
Well, my eggs are special.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.270
They're the kind
women eat during postpartum recovery.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.030
Is Section Chief Shan
in postpartum recovery?

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.000
They're free-range eggs!

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.350
You've eaten too many eggs yourself.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.410
Alright, alright. Both of you, stop.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.480
I'll go see her
in the next couple of days.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.030
I'll talk to her properly
about this matter.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.750
Ye.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You need to hurry.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.880
I know.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.680
Mr. Yan.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:09.990
Have a seat.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.000
I heard you've returned
to teach at school.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.090
Congratulations.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.200
I came today to resign.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.910
This is the 60,000 yuan
you advanced for me before.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.200
Where did you get the money?

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.980
The commission you gave me before,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.780
plus the writing fees I saved up,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.080
it's exactly enough.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.640
Professor Xiang, you're really impressive,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.640
making so much money from writing.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.880
Xiang Beichuan.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.920
Don't you think you're being

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.930
a bit ungrateful?

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.660
When you were down and out,

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.000
I gave you a job,

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.030
provided food and housing,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.790
and even paid you a salary.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.640
While you were here,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.810
despite not accomplishing anything,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.590
I even gave you commission.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.830
Now that you have a new job,

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.550
you're just walking away without a care.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.810
Is that right?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.200
To me, at most,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.640
what we have is

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.640
simply a case of incompatible values.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.240
Let's part ways peacefully.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.590
Incompatible values?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.610
That's true.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.660
You, Professor Xiang, are

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.960
a scholar,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.000
destined to become a writer.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.670
While I'm just

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.140
a lousy boss.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.780
A country bumpkin.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.880
I'm not even worthy
of comparison with you.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.480
Mr. Yan.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.920
In the days to come,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.380
I wish you and your company

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.740
smooth sailing

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.410
and great success.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Then I also wish you

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.370
a bright future

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.600
and great achievements.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.720
Goodbye.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.400
I quit my job at Yan Jun's.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.790
You should have quit long ago.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.390
Focus on your creative work.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640
I'll support you.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.380
No need.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.160
I started a company with my senior.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.890
We plan to work on cultural projects.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.110
Will it make money?

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.830
Definitely not as much as you do.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.960
Actually, for us,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.640
making money
isn't the most important thing.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640
What we value more is

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.110
the influence of cultural projects.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.750
Cultural projects don't need investment?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.680
No costs?

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.640
Without money,
what kind of projects can you do?

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.700
Where will your influence come from?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.830
Let's take it one step at a time.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.090
When I make big money, I'll invest in you.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.270
You're not good at business,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.550
but it doesn't matter if you lose money.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.440
Just be happy.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.700
Ma'am, check please.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.500
Okay, coming.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.030
Why are you paying?

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.430
I'll pay. How much?

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.390
15 in total.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.110
The amount is just right.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.110
What are you doing?

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.000
Take it.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:58.890
Let's go.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.850
Your dishes are ready.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.650
Oh, thank you.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.400
Whose car is this?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.240
It's so nice.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.250
Do you know what brand this is?

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.490
It's a Mercedes, right?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.900
This isn't just any Mercedes.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.100
It's rare even in all of Shanghai.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.830
It's the best model.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.110
Do you know how much this car costs?

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.920
I don't know.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.210
How come you don't know anything?

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.900
This is what I'm working toward.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.490
Ms. Shan?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.630
Ye.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.330
What a coincidence!

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.480
Out for a walk with your boyfriend?

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.310
Yes, we just finished dinner.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.560
That's nice.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.060
What about you?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.550
I just borrowed a car from a friend

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.960
for some errands these days.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.560
So this is your friend's car?

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.230
Just a casual friend.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.370
Alright.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.510
I won't interrupt your romantic time.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.870
Bring Xiang over to my place sometime.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.310
Sure.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.700
Great, I'm off then.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.930
Take care, Huajing.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.720
Goodbye.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.440
Goodbye.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.830
Look at Ms. Shan.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.000
Even her ordinary friend
drives such a nice car,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.330
and you still want me
to stay away from her?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.590
I just think
there's something wrong with this person.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.790
You should keep your distance from her.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.040
Xiang Beichuan.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.480
From now on, I won't tell you

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.680
anything about my work anymore.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.360
I've calculated that

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.720
if we ship now,
we'll just make it in time.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.240
Ye,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.790
I'll need you to make a trip

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.320
to customs this afternoon.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.020
If we don't ship now,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.000
we'll miss Halloween.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.160
I'll go see Ms. Shan soon.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.910
She invited me to her home.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.390
That's great!

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.880
As long as this shipment
goes out smoothly,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.400
the company will have money
to pay everyone's salary

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.240
and bonuses.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.830
Xining,

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.090
I'm counting on you for this bonus.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.640
That's why everyone
says Xining's so capable.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.160
When this young talent steps up,
she's worth two.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.090
She'll go out there
and nail everything down, right?

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.880
Right.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.910
Being invited to her home

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.480
means you two have a good relationship.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.030
Not everyone
gets invited to someone's home.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.920
Don't worry.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.520
I'll have a good talk with her

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.680
and try to seal the deal.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.310
Good.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.230
Ms. Shan.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.040
This is our company's
customs declaration form.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.640
I saw you with Xiang the other day.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.600
You two are still together?

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.390
You're really a good girl,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.920
finding yourself
such a decent, reliable guy.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.850
To be honest,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.070
girls like you are

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.310
rare these days.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.920
Thank you, Huajing.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.180
Our company's shipment

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.240
has been stuck at customs.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.680
I've asked around

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.880
and everyone says
you're in charge of this.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.240
So I wanted to ask for your help

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.310
to see if you could
resolve this issue for me.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.110
Is that so?

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.560
I'll look into it tomorrow.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.850
Actually,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.590
I'm not in charge
of specific matters anymore.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.050
If I intervene too much,
my subordinates will complain.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.400
Does your company have some paperwork

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.720
that's incomplete?

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.110
Customs is undergoing reforms now

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.130
and inspections are very strict.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.400
Ms. Shan,

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.240
our company is small

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.570
and all our funds

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.200
are tied up in this shipment.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.140
Plus there's a time constraint.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.680
It must reach Europe before Halloween.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.670
If it doesn't arrive in time,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.410
all the money for this shipment

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.270
will go down the drain.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.510
That would be the end of our company.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.750
So,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.880
Huajing,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.210
could you please help me

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.790
and our company?

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.100
What you're saying is

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.960
that your company's financial pressure

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.160
is all on my shoulders now?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.640
No,

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.200
that's not what I meant.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.200
I'm not good with words.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.030
I didn't mean that at all.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.950
I just wanted to say,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.860
Huajing, could you help me

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.650
just follow up on this a little?

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.990
Alright, I understand.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.240
You can go now.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.680
I won't bother you anymore.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.280
I'll head back now, Huajing.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.640
Huajing, you should rest.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.620
I'll be going now.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.100
Okay.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.440
Who is it?

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.350
Mr. Yan.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.640
Come in. Come in.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.270
Have you eaten yet?

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:35.790
Not yet.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.090
Please sit down. Let's eat together.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.680
The bowl and chopsticks are clean.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:48.740
Thank you.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.200
Let me serve you some rice.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.580
That's enough.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.640
Try this.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.620
Mr. Yan.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.000
I'm here to ask you about Shan Huajing.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.560
What about Shan Huajing?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.660
We have an important shipment

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.640
that's stuck at customs.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.420
Ms. Shan won't approve it.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.400
You know, Ms. Shan
has always been nice to me.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.680
She treats me like a real sister.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.930
But suddenly
she won't help with this matter.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.400
I thought since you have
a good relationship with her,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.920
could you ask her

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.400
if I did something wrong

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.480
or made some mistake?

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.880
Is this dish too salty for you?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.640
Let me get you some water.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.490
Or would you prefer a drink?

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.690
No need. It's perfect, not salty at all.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.740
It's not that you did anything wrong.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.160
Shan Huajing doesn't have
anything against you either.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.770
It's just that many things

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.730
aren't what they appear to be.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.690
Appearances can be deceiving.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.800
People like Shan Huajing

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.070
don't work for free.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.640
No pay, no service.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.540
I understand.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.280
How much should I offer?

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.250
Is the shipment you mentioned

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.920
the Halloween merchandise

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.380
you're sending to Europe?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.410
That's quite a large shipment.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.400
I think

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.270
you'll need to prepare at least 100,000.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.070
That much?

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.750
I'll need to call Mr. Lu

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.320
to discuss this with him.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.720
About delivering the money,

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.830
will you do it

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.850
or will Lu do it?

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.680
I'll do it.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.870
I've always been the one
dealing with Ms. Shan.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.730
If you're going to deliver it,

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.070
be careful.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.640
Also,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.160
if your company has any financial issues,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.800
come to me. I can help.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.230
Don't worry about it.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.790
Once you've sold this shipment

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.440
and made a profit,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.880
you can pay me back then.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.740
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.790
Don't worry about it now. Let's eat.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.350
After dinner,

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.750
you can still call Mr. Lu.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720
Besides, I think

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:01.900
this matter

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.260
won't be a big problem.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.400
Eat up.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.120
That's what Yan Jun said?

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.940
This woman is really greedy.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:29.550
But there's only 50,000 yuan
left in the company account.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.980
For the remaining 50,000,

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.240
I'll figure something out quickly.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.070
Mr. Lu,

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.610
it's already too late.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.590
Let's do this.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.920
I'll take care of

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.570
the remaining 50,000.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.630
Good.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.130
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.170
I don't know anything.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.510
I didn't hear anything.
Don't tell me about it.

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.850
I'm going to Qipu Road to sell pants.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.510
You guys talk. I know nothing.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.090
I'll hurry to the bank
and withdraw the money for you.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.680
Here, take this, girl.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.500
Here's your change.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.240
All right.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240
Come back if you need anything else.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.260
Don't pass by without stopping!

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.750
Export-quality jeans and shirts!

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.409
Export-quality jeans and shirts here!

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.030
These are all premium goods for export.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.360
Foreign merchandise!

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.670
You can't find these anywhere else.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.400
Jiuling.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:22.800
What brings you here, Beichuan?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.670
I'm here with my students
for field research.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.360
Are any of them like that girl
from the other day

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.190
who bought everything in sight...

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.630
No, no.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.800
Not anymore.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.350
I heard from Xining
that you're becoming a writer.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.139
Are you writing novels?

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.840
So you're going to be a famous author.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.000
Don't forget about me, okay?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.630
How could I?

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.320
You might just walk by someday,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.630
pretending you don't know me anymore.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.960
-No way.
-And then even spit on me.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.500
Jiuling.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.230
You would never?

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.630
When you all become successful,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.889
don't forget about me.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.960
What success are you talking about?

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.960
Right now we're hanging by a thread.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.230
Mr. Lu had a good plan.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.000
He planned to finish this batch of goods

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.590
and ship them abroad before

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.360
the European Halloween.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.630
But now

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.490
they're stuck at customs.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.270
You know that woman,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.800
Shan Huajing,
is so difficult to deal with.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.400
I thought

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.030
that my two boxes of farm eggs

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.480
would be enough as a small gift.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.190
But then Ye and Mr. Lu

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.920
gave me a hard time about it.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.320
I didn't understand why.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.610
Now I finally get it.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.550
Come, take a look!

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.690
She looks down on our little gifts.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.150
When I heard what those two

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.550
were planning to give today,
I was shocked.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.430
What are they giving?

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.470
Money, of course.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.260
They're giving her money?

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.840
How much?

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.820
No, I can't tell you.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.510
If I tell you, aren't we accomplices?

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.840
We're not accomplices.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.840
Tell me quickly, Jiuling. How much?

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.840
I'm already upset about it.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.170
I might as well tell you.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.030
Hurry up.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.740
100,000 yuan.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.540
100,000.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.670
Well.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.630
Don't tell anyone I told you.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.960
Don't miss out, everyone!

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.350
What's wrong?

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.510
What's in your bag?

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.720
A few books for my friend.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.630
Some books?

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.800
Let me check them for you.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.550
No need.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.360
I just picked up some novels.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.620
I need to go now.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:32.800
Wait.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.980
You're going to see Shan Huajing, right?

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.510
It's illegal to bribe a public servant.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.030
Didn't you help Yan Jun
do the same thing before?

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.400
I didn't know about it then.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.440
Then you can pretend not to know now too.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.280
Ye Xining,

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.670
please calm down.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.000
Be clear-headed, okay?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.320
I am perfectly clear-headed.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.050
It's because I am clear-headed

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:01.800
that I don't want
the factory to close down.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.190
Right now, Shan Huajing
is blocking this shipment

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.840
from leaving customs.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.960
What am I supposed to do?

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.510
If the goods can't be shipped,
the factory will close.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.590
All the employees will lose their jobs.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.510
Can you take that responsibility?

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.550
But you can't use illegal means

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.030
to solve this problem.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.190
Think about it carefully.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.230
There must be legal and compliant ways.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.230
I've already thought of
every possible solution.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.800
You think I want to do this?

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.280
You're in your ivory tower.
You don't understand.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.080
You have no idea

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.940
how complicated the business is.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.030
Yes.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.440
I don't know what business is like,

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.690
but I know the principles
of being a decent person.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.500
Enough!

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.320
I really hate that arrogant
teacherly attitude of yours!

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.730
Always standing on your moral high ground,

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.030
lecturing me on
how to behave and what to do.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.230
Would you stop it?

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.030
Aren't you being hypocritical?

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.090
I'm hypocritical?

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.450
Ye Xining.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.830
Aren't you being hypocritical?

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.520
Ask yourself honestly.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.030
You usually act

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.840
so close with Shan Huajing,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:54.990
but is there really pure friendship

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.670
between you two?

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.840
Are you two really like close sisters?

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.230
She asks you for 100,000 yuan today,
and you give it to her.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.630
What if she asks for 100 million tomorrow?

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:05.680
Would you give it to her?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.510
What's it to you, Xiang Beichuan?

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.960
If she asks for a billion,
I'll give it to her too.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.890
Whatever she wants, I'll give it to her.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.400
You're just a university teacher.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.400
Your mouth is full of morality talk.
It's disgusting.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.230
How much money
have you earned for us?

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.900
Have you earned enough for a car?

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.280
Or enough for a house?

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.030
Ye Xining.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.000
I want you to look at yourself right now.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400
You said you hated Director Jin before.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.550
You hated Yan Jun.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.400
But what about now?

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.110
You've become just like them.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.670
Where is your conscience? Your principles?

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.190
Have you thrown them away?

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.630
Are you crazy?

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.020
You can't go!

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.120
What are you doing?

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.510
I have to go!

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.320
Leave me alone!

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.890
Why are you here?

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.110
Ms. Shan.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.880
I came to see you.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.680
Alright, let's go upstairs
and sit for a while.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.110
Come in.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.830
No need to change your shoes.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:44.920
Have a seat.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.840
Did you come today

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.030
because customs is holding back

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.890
that shipment from your company?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.710
No.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.960
I wanted to treat you to dinner.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.350
What would you like to eat? We can go out.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.330
I'm on a diet recently.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.610
I don't eat dinner.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.950
You have such a great figure.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.210
You don't need to diet.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.630
Let's go out to eat.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.480
Why do we need to go out?

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.150
Ye.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.520
You're not as straightforward
as you used to be.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.710
Ye.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.880
You've been talking to me for so long,

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.230
and I still don't understand

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.690
what you're trying to say.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.510
If you don't have anything else,

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.670
you should go now.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.210
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.320
Huajing.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.100
Actually, I came today

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.920
to bring you

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.630
some books.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.500
They're some classic novels.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.030
Who is it?

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.150
I'll get it.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.510
Section Chief Shan.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.920
I just want to have
a quick word with Xining.
