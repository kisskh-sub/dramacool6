Well...

The ones doing the rescuing are those hurrying to the emergency.

And a caller only feels relief when they see an ambulance or fire truck.

But I'm more of a couch potato, so I'll pass.

I sent her a New Year's message as well but got no response.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.190
I thought so.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.550
But it switched to "read," so at least we know she's alive.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.970
That's right. No news is good news, after all.

Still...

I'm sure Kaneshita said his piece to you,

I think our Squad 3 has potential

because we have such unique dispatchers on our team.

But we really can't send anyone because of a noisy dog.

I admit that Kaneshita has a foul mouth,

Nothing. Just doing my work as the team leader.

No, I don't think this is gas.

No, it's nothing to that degree.

I just wish something would be done about it.

The scent may have died down when officials arrived, too.

I'm just glad it wasn't a case of bioterrorism.

- Ambulance! Hurry!

There's blood! On the pavement, his head... everywhere!

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.300
- Ma'am, are you the one bleeding?
- No, a man veered and fell.

He was riding an electric scooter.

Did he veer off on a street? Or the highway?

He's at a crosswalk. There's a bridge!

No, he's not. Definitely not.

You called the people on site to ask?

We had some difficulty on our end identifying the caller's precise location.

It's my job as an admin to make sure help arrived as intended.

[Firefighter Festival 2020]

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.900
dispatchers are the first to hear someone's cry for help.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.880
They must imagine what scenario the caller is in

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.760
from sound and voice alone.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.960
At times, they're even required to determine how to save a life.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:06.360
If those who work on site rescue folks with their two hands,

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:12.410
then dispatchers save lives with their imagination.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:27.500
Hearing your speech convinced me to become a dispatcher, Sir.

But, Sir...

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.980
No matter how much we imagine,

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.300
there will always be lives we cannot save, right?

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.600
Is that why I shouldn't get invested in every call I receive?

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.010
Should I truly forget and move on as soon as the call is over?

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:04.890
Forgetting and moving on mean different things.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.790
The odd scent reported at Marin Mall

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:32.330
was discovered to be the fault of malfunctioning cleaning robots.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.890
So what exactly was the issue?

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.130
Well, you see...

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.700
How should I explain this?

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.900
The malfunctioning robot bumped into a cooling machine,

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.850
causing the ammonia inside to leak, which was that odd smell.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.670
The robot also hit other generators, causing the power outages,

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.700
faulty shutters, and fire.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Does that suffice?

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.790
She spoke more than a word.

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:05.640
I was so surprised that I processed none of it.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.530
But thanks for the explanation.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.830
Tough crowd...

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.180
Why do I have to...

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.190
Kasuhara.

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:38.390
Hello there, Sir.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.530
You visited Marin Mall after that first call about the smell, didn't you?

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.090
Oh, you found out?

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.470
Just know you got lucky this time around, all right?

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:54.420
I still haven't forgiven you for barging in on a site.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.600
I'm well aware.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:00.070
But, Sir,

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.990
may I speak my mind as well?

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.160
Kaneshita-san,

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:12.080
you said our role as a dispatcher was to act as a stand-in.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.670
We only convey the caller's status to those heading to the rescue.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:24.640
We're not the ones doing the rescuing.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.340
I certainly said that. And?

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.820
Sir, I don't think that's all our role entails.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.830
Because I've experienced it.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:45.310
I know a dispatcher can save lives.

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.620
[119]

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.610
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.540
Fire.

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.360
Please save us.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:07.480
You're speaking in riddles.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.670
In any case, we may be stand-ins.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:14.510
But I think we're stand-ins who tether lives together.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:21.530
After all, dispatchers are always the first

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:24.340
to hear someone's cry for help.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:32.560
I believe our imaginations can change the future, you know?

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:37.370
♫ If only I had been able to forget ♫

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:44.040
Though our beliefs may differ, I look forward to working with you.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:52.130
♫ Without understanding how things are, I closed my eyes ♫

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.110
- Y-You don't need to get so angry...
- Here.

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.240
This was addressed to you.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.190
♫ What's the answer? ♫

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.350
That's all.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:13.570

Fire department's 119...
[CALL 2: A factory fire]

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.400
A fire erupted in our factory's storehouse.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.550
Someone collapsed from the smoke!

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.200
We'll send the fire department and ambulance right away.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.870
- Kaneshita!
- Kaneshita-san!

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.690
I only caused confusion. I even wrecked someone else's life.

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:41.470
Sometimes it may be harder to open up to family.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.370
You should tell him sooner rather than later.

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:45.060
I'm sorry I never told you.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.830
Do you like working as a dispatcher?

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:48.690
Neither the caller nor the dispatcher is ever perfect.

01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:51.430
You can't resolve an issue on your own.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.980
I strive to take each and every call to heart.
