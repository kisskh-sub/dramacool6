I sent her a New Year's message as well but got no response.

I thought so.

But it switched to "read," so at least we know she's alive.

That's right. No news is good news, after all.

I think our Squad 3 has potential

I admit that Kaneshita has a foul mouth,

No, I don't think this is gas.

No, it's nothing to that degree.

There's blood! On the pavement, his head... everywhere!

- Ma'am, are you the one bleeding?
- No, a man veered and fell.

He was riding an electric scooter.

Did he veer off on a street? Or the highway?

No, he's not. Definitely not.

[Firefighter Festival 2020]

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.900
dispatchers are the first to hear someone's cry for help.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.880
They must imagine what scenario the caller is in

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.760
from sound and voice alone.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.960
At times, they're even required to determine how to save a life.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:06.360
If those who work on site rescue folks with their two hands,

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:12.410
then dispatchers save lives with their imagination.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:27.500
Hearing your speech convinced me to become a dispatcher, Sir.

But, Sir...

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.980
No matter how much we imagine,

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.300
there will always be lives we cannot save, right?

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.600
Is that why I shouldn't get invested in every call I receive?

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.010
Should I truly forget and move on as soon as the call is over?

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:04.890
Forgetting and moving on mean different things.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.790
The odd scent reported at Marin Mall

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:32.330
was discovered to be the fault of malfunctioning cleaning robots.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.890
So what exactly was the issue?

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.130
Well, you see...

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.700
How should I explain this?

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.900
The malfunctioning robot bumped into a cooling machine,

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.850
causing the ammonia inside to leak, which was that odd smell.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.670
The robot also hit other generators, causing the power outages,

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.700
faulty shutters, and fire.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Does that suffice?

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.790
She spoke more than a word.

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:05.640
I was so surprised that I processed none of it.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.530
But thanks for the explanation.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.830
Tough crowd...

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.180
Why do I have to...

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.190
Kasuhara.

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:38.390
Hello there, Sir.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.530
You visited Marin Mall after that first call about the smell, didn't you?

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.090
Oh, you found out?

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.470
Just know you got lucky this time around, all right?

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:54.420
I still haven't forgiven you for barging in on a site.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.600
I'm well aware.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:00.070
But, Sir,

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.990
may I speak my mind as well?

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.160
Kaneshita-san,

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:12.080
you said our role as a dispatcher was to act as a stand-in.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.670
We only convey the caller's status to those heading to the rescue.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:24.640
We're not the ones doing the rescuing.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.340
I certainly said that. And?

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.820
Sir, I don't think that's all our role entails.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.830
Because I've experienced it.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:45.310
I know a dispatcher can save lives.

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.620
[119]

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.610
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.540
Fire.

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.360
Please save us.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:07.480
You're speaking in riddles.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.670
In any case, we may be stand-ins.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:14.510
But I think we're stand-ins who tether lives together.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:21.530
After all, dispatchers are always the first

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:24.340
to hear someone's cry for help.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:32.560
I believe our imaginations can change the future, you know?

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:37.370
â™« If only I had been able to forget â™«

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:44.040
Though our beliefs may differ, I look forward to working with you.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:52.130
â™« Without understanding how things are, I closed my eyes â™«

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.110
- Y-You don't need to get so angry...
- Here.

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.240
This was addressed to you.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.190
â™« What's the answer? â™«

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.350
That's all.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:08.930
â™« To protect yourself from unfamiliar pain? Yet... â™«

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:13.570
â™« You are calling out to me â™«

01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.040
[Dear Kasuhara-sama*,]
[*Respectful suffix]

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.800
[Thank you for helping my daughter the other day...]

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.940
[Wishing you the very best, in both work and health...]

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.340
[Thank you very much. From, Yamashita Emi]

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.610

01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:33.580
Thank you for saving me. From, Rino.
[119]

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.010
Thank you!

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.190
â™« Iâ€™ll come to you, I swear â™«

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.370
â™« Remember that â™«

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.510
All right then.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.530
[Preview]

01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:26.880
Fire department's 119...
[CALL 2: A factory fire]

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.400
A fire erupted in our factory's storehouse.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.550
Someone collapsed from the smoke!

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.200
We'll send the fire department and ambulance right away.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.870
- Kaneshita!
- Kaneshita-san!

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.690
I only caused confusion. I even wrecked someone else's life.

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:41.470
Sometimes it may be harder to open up to family.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.370
You should tell him sooner rather than later.

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:45.060
I'm sorry I never told you.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.830
Do you like working as a dispatcher?

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:48.690
Neither the caller nor the dispatcher is ever perfect.

01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:51.430
You can't resolve an issue on your own.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.980
I strive to take each and every call to heart.
