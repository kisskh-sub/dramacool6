00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:02.425
(Episode 94)

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:09.195
That's enough.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.005
Jae In, didn't you say you had to head home early?

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:21.745
Let's go. I'll take you home.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.715
Sorry, I'm going to head out first.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.755
Let's have a drink, Chairman.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.325
The chicken here is amazing.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.465
Way to kill the mood. Can't he read the room?

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.665
We were finally enjoying ourselves,

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:48.335
and he just killed the vibe.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:52.105
Well then, how about we call it a night...

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.315
and get together again soon?

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.275
Sounds good.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.515
How about just the two of us go for a drink? Deal?

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:00.015
I'm in.

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:05.285
Shall we make a quiet exit home together?

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:26.145
That's enough.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:36.785
We're here, Do Yun.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:41.155
We're here.

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:46.565
Oh, right.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:49.935
What's on your mind?

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:54.435
It's nothing. You should go inside.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:58.705
Thanks for the ride.

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:00.615
Get home safely.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.855
It's a shame the company dinner ended so abruptly.

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:16.455
Want to grab a drink?

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.565
Maybe next time. I have things to do.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:22.035
In front of all those people,

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:26.335
It's not a good look trying to drag a woman away.

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.735
As the chairman,

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.175
you should be more mindful of your conduct.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.545
And it's not like she's just an acquaintance.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:36.545
Especially since you two are over.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:38.345
Over?

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:40.615
Jae In is your ex-wife, right?

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:43.585
You knew?

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:45.455
Of course.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:47.525
I told you.

00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:49.455
I'm interested in her.

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:53.565
So you knew she was my ex-wife and still said that to my face.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:56.195
Well, you two are nothing to each other now.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:57.665
Why should I be careful?

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:01.835
Like I said, I'm not one to dwell on the past.

00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:04.045
Go on, then.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.805
What did you have to say to Jae In that you'd drag her away in public?

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:35.475
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with Jae In?

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:38.605
Stop that nasty habit of yours of tearing into people.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:43.815
I said I won't interfere if you two see each other, and I won't,

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:45.785
but at least have some decency.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:47.755
Is cheating something to brag about?

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:49.885
If you're going to see her, do it in secret.

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.025
Everyone in the company knows I'm your wife.

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:54.225
What does that make me look like?

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:55.355
You're so loud.

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:57.095
You're giving me a headache. Get out.

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:01.735
I am still your wife.

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:06.735
So I'll find out what's owed to me and claim what's rightfully mine.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:11.745
Where's the slush fund that Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol left?

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.215
See? I'm not the only one keeping secrets.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.815
How long were you planning on keeping this from me?

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.685
Everything you've accomplished, everything you have,

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:25.555
you didn't do it all on your own.

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:27.395
We built this together.

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:31.625
So I have a right to know and a right to my share.

00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.295
Where's the slush fund?

00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:37.605
I don't know. I haven't found it yet.

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:40.575
You really haven't found it?

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:44.345
Yes. If I had it, would Jae In be quiet?

00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:48.775
Then you'd better share it with me. Exactly how much you know.

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:53.345
I don't know much. All I have is a note with an address.

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:10.735
Hey...

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:18.075
So your mom said things while drunk, and now you're not talking to me?

00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:24.285
I was too hungover to eat yesterday. Aren't you worried about me at all?

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:26.845
I haven't seen you in two days,

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:30.215
and I've wasted away to nothing.

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:37.195
We'll put the door over here, and make it a sliding pocket door.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:39.165
Here's some coffee for everyone.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:41.735
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:48.805
If she has a great man by her side,

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:50.535
no losers would even dare to come near, right?

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.745
The more I see him, the more I like him.

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:56.215
I heard he's a famous art dealer.

00:05:57.885 --> 00:05:59.115
This one? Okay.

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:02.385
- This one is for Jae In. - Thanks.

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:06.525
Is it okay if I treat you like an older brother?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.795
Whatever you're comfortable with. You can just call me by my name.

00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:14.035
So what do you think of my sister? You two look so good together.

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:20.165
Kang Seung Woo, stop joking around.

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:23.575
I'm not. I'm being 100 percent serious.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:30.045
He says we look great together. Shouldn't we try to humour him?

00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:33.115
Please forgive him. He's just a doting younger brother.

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.185
He sets me up with anyone he likes, so please don't get the wrong idea.

00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:37.755
Don't worry about it.

00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:38.825
I'm actually flattered.

00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:40.925
I'm a fool for you too, you know.

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:48.795
See? I've got a good eye for these things.

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:52.765
Jae In, a straightforward guy like Teo...

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:55.335
is honest and manly, and he'd be a great match for you.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.275
Seung Woo, I told you to cut it out.

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:06.185
I have an off-site meeting. I'll be back later.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.385
Have a good meeting.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:26.435
What's going on? Something's felt off for a few days.

00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:29.475
Like I forgot to eat something,

00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:31.975
or forgot to see someone.

00:07:33.005 --> 00:07:36.715
Right, I haven't seen Hwang Na Ra around.

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:41.485
She used to constantly pester me. No wonder it's been so quiet.

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:45.225
I think she asked me to go to the movies around this time.

00:07:45.855 --> 00:07:47.725
I bet she even sent me the tickets already.

00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:58.065
Hello? Who is this?

00:07:58.405 --> 00:07:59.565
You wanted to see a movie today.

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:07.345
Assistant Manager Kang? Is that really you?

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:11.845
Did you ask some other guy to the movies?

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:14.985
No! I only have eyes for one person.

00:08:18.055 --> 00:08:21.395
You sound energetic enough. Be there on time.

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:24.325
You'll really see a movie with me?

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:29.295
Never mind.

00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:31.805
I don't deserve to see a movie.

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.675
I don't deserve to be happy with you.

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:40.275
I'll be at the cafe in front of the theatre after work.

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:43.975
But I told you I can't go! Don't wait for me.

00:08:44.945 --> 00:08:47.045
I'll just wait here until you show up.

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:48.885
What?

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.155
Hello?

00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:03.395
Ji Ho said he wanted to see you, Princess, so we came.

00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:05.865
That's right, Auntie.

00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:07.935
I mean, Princess.

00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:11.005
What were you thinking, just bringing him out like this?

00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:13.805
Did you ask his parents for permission first?

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:17.745
I'm his big brother, so I don't need permission.

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:19.615
Right?

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:22.255
Can we draw here?

00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:25.185
We even brought our own supplies.

00:09:28.895 --> 00:09:30.255
Go ahead. You can use the table.

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:02.655
Excuse me.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.225
Looks like you have company.

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.995
Yes, something like that. What brings you here now?

00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:13.035
I was in the area for work. But what's going on?

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:18.075
First, I need you to look at this. Hwang Gi Man drew these.

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:28.415
They're all pictures of stairs.

00:10:28.515 --> 00:10:31.485
I heard his accident was a fall down the stairs.

00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:35.595
It's strange for an amnesiac to draw stairs so compulsively.

00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:38.565
You're right. It's definitely strange.

00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:40.825
He may not remember it,

00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:42.065
but the fall's trauma could be showing...

00:10:42.065 --> 00:10:43.765
in his subconscious drawings.

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.105
So you think it might not have been a simple falling accident?

00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:53.675
Well, looking at these, the trauma from the accident must've been huge.

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:56.945
I drew my dad.

00:10:58.085 --> 00:11:00.315
I want to show this to my dad.

00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:03.915
Let's go show it to Gi Chan. I know where his company is.

00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:12.825
I have to go back to the office. I'll take them to their parents.

00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:15.865
And it'd be awkward for you to contact that family anyway.

00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:17.935
That would be a huge help. Thank you.

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:23.405
Ji Ho, this gentleman is taking you and your uncle to your father.

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:29.975
I was hoping for dinner tonight, but I have another appointment.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:31.085
Let's do it next time.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:34.185
Right. I have plans tonight too.

00:11:35.685 --> 00:11:36.815
Mom!

00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:39.425
Ji Ho!

00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:43.125
Mom, I missed you.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.965
Ji Ho, have you been well?

00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:49.265
I ran into them at Yu Gyeong's.

00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.235
I brought them because I heard they were coming here.

00:11:56.575 --> 00:11:58.205
Oh! There's Gi Chan!

00:11:58.205 --> 00:11:59.205
Gi Chan!

00:12:00.305 --> 00:12:01.475
Hey! It's Dad!

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.475
Dad!

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:06.415
Hey there, Ji Ho. Up you go!

00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:09.515
Ji Ho, how did you come here?

00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:12.155
I said my uncle and I were going to see you at your office,

00:12:12.925 --> 00:12:14.655
so that man over there gave me a ride.

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:23.135
Ji Ho, do you want to go to the office with me?

00:12:25.605 --> 00:12:26.605
Come with me, Gi Man.

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:37.075
Try not to let it get to you.

00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:08.375
Teo? Was this the appointment you had?

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:11.115
Yes. And you?

00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.615
Seung Woo booked it. He said the vibe here was great.

00:13:15.355 --> 00:13:16.355
Seung Woo did?

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:19.685
My goodness.

00:13:22.395 --> 00:13:25.695
Don't tell me Seung Woo asked to meet you too.

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:27.425
He did.

00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:31.435
Unbelievable.

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:43.675
Teo.

00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:46.185
About today...

00:13:46.415 --> 00:13:51.115
I think Seung Woo must have gotten the wrong idea.

00:13:51.185 --> 00:13:53.485
I know what you're trying to say.

00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:55.455
I had no idea this was going to happen either.

00:13:57.095 --> 00:14:01.025
I'm so sorry. I'll have a word with Seung Woo.

00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:04.295
There's no need.

00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:07.935
He even booked us a table here. Isn't it fun?

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.805
That of all people, we're the ones caught in this unexpected situation.

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.345
I don't know. I guess we did get caught up in it.

00:14:19.615 --> 00:14:24.785
I actually like the unexpectedness. You know, a coincidence? A surprise?

00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:28.255
That little bit of magic you find in unexpected moments.

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:30.025
And that's why I'm enjoying this.

00:14:36.895 --> 00:14:38.465
Let's not give it a second thought,

00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:40.735
and just enjoy ourselves. What do you say?

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:55.255
Jae In and Teo both got off work early today, right?

00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:57.255
That's right.

00:14:57.685 --> 00:15:00.525
But weren't you supposed to meet Jae In?

00:15:00.685 --> 00:15:02.895
Jae In said she had dinner plans with you before she left.

00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:07.095
I played matchmaker for Jae In and Teo.

00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:11.835
I have a knack for matchmaking. When two people seem right together,

00:15:11.905 --> 00:15:13.965
I just get a gut feeling, you know?

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:20.405
Anyway, I have an appointment, so I should get going.

00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:25.485
Oh, it's not a date or anything.

00:15:25.815 --> 00:15:27.545
It's more like humanitarian.

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:28.955
Something like that.

00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:33.155
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:36.155
Not at the moment.

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:39.295
Me neither.

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:42.165
Maybe us single guys should work out together sometime.

00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:45.635
Okay. That sounds good.

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.865
Great. Well, I'll get going then.

00:16:12.995 --> 00:16:15.835
It's been a while. Won't you even let me see your face?

00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:22.435
I'm a mess and I'm not wearing any makeup.

00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:24.075
So what?

00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:27.345
Who wants to show their bare face to the guy they like?

00:16:28.575 --> 00:16:31.115
So I told you not to come, but you insisted on waiting.

00:16:32.285 --> 00:16:34.315
You said you wanted to see a movie. Let's go.

00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:37.715
It's been a while. Let's just talk instead of seeing a movie.

00:16:38.655 --> 00:16:40.285
About how you've been lately and all that.

00:16:41.495 --> 00:16:42.825
I don't want to talk about it.

00:16:43.695 --> 00:16:45.365
Fine, then you can just listen to me.

00:16:46.165 --> 00:16:47.165
What can I get you to drink?

00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:53.505
Wait, so Director Kang Mi Ran is your birth mother,

00:16:53.635 --> 00:16:57.075
and CEO Patrick of DH Holdings is your biological father?

00:16:57.675 --> 00:16:58.805
It's wild, isn't it?

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:03.045
You haven't known about CEO Patrick for very long, have you?

00:17:04.145 --> 00:17:06.345
But you seem to be handling it surprisingly well.

00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:09.655
- Weren't you shocked? - I was surprised,

00:17:10.015 --> 00:17:11.585
but it's not like he knew about me all along.

00:17:13.525 --> 00:17:16.355
It's not as if he knew I existed and chose to ignore me.

00:17:17.225 --> 00:17:21.225
He knows now, and we can try to connect.

00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:24.495
It's not a crime to not know something.

00:17:24.805 --> 00:17:26.435
It's what you do after you find out,

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:28.205
that's what really matters, don't you think?

00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:31.235
Right.

00:17:31.545 --> 00:17:33.675
What you do after you find out...

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:35.915
That's true.

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:39.845
Do you know about my family's situation?

00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:43.555
A little. Patrick told me.

00:17:45.285 --> 00:17:47.855
But I thought you didn't want to talk about it today.

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:49.525
Let's just stick to me doing the talking.

00:18:26.325 --> 00:18:27.895
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:31.865
Is something wrong?

00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:33.835
No.

00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:40.505
I should go. You should head in.

00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:44.645
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:47.545
Do Yun?

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.895
I guess I was jealous.

00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:02.895
I heard from Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:05.205
About your dinner plans with Teo.

00:19:06.505 --> 00:19:09.475
You're free to see whoever you want, Jae In.

00:19:10.605 --> 00:19:12.375
It's not like I have any right to object,

00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.045
but I liked you first.

00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.655
Saying it out loud sounds so childish.

00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:23.885
I sound like a little kid, don't I?

00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:28.555
Just forget I said that.

00:19:29.995 --> 00:19:30.995
I'm sorry.

00:19:31.995 --> 00:19:32.995
I'll get going.

00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:36.995
We just had dinner.

00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:39.605
Nothing else happened.

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:42.975
What you said about waiting for me.

00:19:44.845 --> 00:19:46.045
I haven't forgotten that.

00:20:11.395 --> 00:20:14.565
(Joint Supplement)

00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:32.025
Mom, you're taking good care of yourself.

00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:33.655
How have your knees been lately?

00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:38.665
Thanks to you, I am taking this. The throbbing pain is much better.

00:20:41.425 --> 00:20:44.595
And I feel like the stiffness in my joints has eased up too.

00:20:45.835 --> 00:20:46.865
Thank you.

00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:49.935
Keep taking it for your joint health.

00:20:50.305 --> 00:20:52.075
I'll order more when you run out.

00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:54.675
- I'm heading out. - Okay, be safe.

00:20:55.275 --> 00:20:56.475
Watch out for cars.

00:20:59.615 --> 00:21:00.645
Hey, you're here.

00:21:04.655 --> 00:21:06.155
She's in good spirits today.

00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:11.255
Mom, I'm here.

00:21:11.925 --> 00:21:13.765
Shouldn't you be at work? What are you doing here?

00:21:14.225 --> 00:21:15.595
I came to hang out with you, Mom.

00:21:16.295 --> 00:21:18.335
Don't worry. I took the day off.

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:22.205
Mom, do you know how hard I worked just so I could take today off?

00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:24.505
Pretty great, right?

00:21:24.945 --> 00:21:27.775
Come on, Mom. Pat me on the head and tell me I did a good job.

00:21:30.715 --> 00:21:32.645
Stop coming here. Just go.

00:21:36.515 --> 00:21:38.855
Mom, come on. Hang out with me.

00:21:39.425 --> 00:21:40.425
Please?

00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:50.665
You're being a nuisance. Just go.

00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:53.965
Mom.

00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:56.735
Mom, look at me. Please?

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:03.045
I heard you told Mi Ran to legally register me as her son.

00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:05.385
She's your biological mother.

00:22:05.985 --> 00:22:07.415
Now that you've found out everything,

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:10.755
so you don't need to remain on my register.

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:14.685
Think of it as setting things right and sort it out quickly.

00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:20.825
I'm tired. I need to rest.

00:22:21.165 --> 00:22:22.165
Leave.

00:22:30.235 --> 00:22:33.345
Mom, you know how stubborn I can be.

00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:35.645
I think I get it all from you.

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:40.015
It's true Mi Ran gave birth to me,

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.455
and I know she's my biological mother.

00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:45.355
But, Mom...

00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:49.155
To me, you're my mom.

00:22:50.695 --> 00:22:52.165
That's true now,

00:22:53.295 --> 00:22:55.335
and it'll be true even if you forget who I am.

00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:03.075
I don't know how long you'll be able to remember me.

00:23:05.075 --> 00:23:07.145
I'm going to do my best to slow it down.

00:23:08.915 --> 00:23:10.515
But we can't waste the time we have.

00:23:10.975 --> 00:23:11.985
Right?

00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:14.915
So, no more talk about the family register,

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.485
and if you're tired, sleep, and then we'll hang out when you wake up.

00:23:19.855 --> 00:23:21.125
You'll hang out with me, right, Mom?

00:23:39.475 --> 00:23:41.245
How's the internal audit on Hwang Gi Chan going?

00:23:41.245 --> 00:23:43.145
It's taking longer than expected.

00:23:43.915 --> 00:23:46.585
It seems the Louis B case was just the tip of the iceberg.

00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:48.515
We're finding one suspicious thing after another.

00:23:49.155 --> 00:23:53.725
We're reviewing all the projects he handled before becoming chairman,

00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:55.055
so it's going to take a while.

00:23:56.655 --> 00:24:01.525
Hwang Gi Chan thinks the audit is just about the Louis B project?

00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:04.665
Jae In, you know the head of the audit team.

00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:06.665
Nothing is going to get out.

00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:13.075
Yes, he's a principled man since my father's time.

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:19.345
- Are you in contact with his board? - Yes.

00:24:19.615 --> 00:24:23.315
The neutral members are with us, so there isn't much pushback.

00:24:23.855 --> 00:24:26.225
Besides, they're all veterans from my brother's time.

00:24:27.485 --> 00:24:31.355
They're sharp enough to figure out what's best for the company,

00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:33.425
and what's in their own best interest.

00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:38.395
Jae In, just be ready to take down Hwang Gi Chan at the meeting.

00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:40.135
And we need to take him down so hard...

00:24:40.135 --> 00:24:41.465
that he never even thinks of coming back.

00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:43.275
Right.

00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:46.875
I'll do everything I can to help.

00:24:50.645 --> 00:24:53.485
I worked myself to the bone to raise that boy.

00:24:54.085 --> 00:24:56.085
He's in and out in a flash, morning and evening.

00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:58.355
He doesn't even show his face.

00:24:59.225 --> 00:25:00.825
How many days has it been now?

00:25:01.455 --> 00:25:03.755
What? He's miserable because of me?

00:25:04.025 --> 00:25:05.295
He lost Jae In?

00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:08.165
How ridiculous.

00:25:08.565 --> 00:25:10.765
It's all because of that little vixen.

00:25:13.405 --> 00:25:17.435
That's it. Today, I'll teach her a lesson she won't forget.

00:25:19.675 --> 00:25:23.475
(Designer Kang Jae In)

00:25:26.215 --> 00:25:28.045
You wench!

00:25:28.615 --> 00:25:31.985
The divorce should've been the end! How dare you mess with my Gi Chan?

00:25:32.055 --> 00:25:34.685
- Let go of me! - I will not!

00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:36.725
You teamed up with those scoundrels...

00:25:36.725 --> 00:25:38.595
to extort money and run your scams,

00:25:38.725 --> 00:25:40.825
and you think you can hurt my family? You wench!

00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:42.395
I'll just kill you!

00:25:42.635 --> 00:25:44.665
I said, let go of me!

00:25:47.335 --> 00:25:48.335
Come here!

00:25:50.575 --> 00:25:52.005
I said, let go of me!

00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:53.775
You wench!

00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:57.515
Hey! Give me my son back.

00:25:57.775 --> 00:25:59.915
My son Gi Chan has changed because of you!

00:26:00.085 --> 00:26:01.185
What are you talking about?

00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:02.755
Give him back!

00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:05.325
- Hey, you! - What do you think you're doing?

00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:07.785
That's enough!

00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:10.855
Chairman, get out of the way.

00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:14.365
I'm going to beat some sense into her today.

00:26:14.425 --> 00:26:15.435
Mother!

00:26:16.165 --> 00:26:17.565
- You... - This is why...

00:26:17.935 --> 00:26:20.405
I blame you for everything!

00:26:20.765 --> 00:26:22.175
It's because you act like this!

00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:24.605
Did a single word I said get through to you?

00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:27.605
I told you I was struggling.

00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:29.575
And did you listen to a single word I said?

00:26:29.915 --> 00:26:33.645
Are you proud that vixen duped you? How dare you yell at your mother?

00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:34.745
Please, just stop!

00:26:37.215 --> 00:26:38.555
Please, just stay out of it.

00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:42.395
If you so much as lay a finger on her,

00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:45.725
I'll cut you out of my life for good.

00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:48.495
You...

00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:49.995
I've made myself perfectly clear.

00:26:51.335 --> 00:26:52.605
When I say I'll do something, I do it.

00:26:53.735 --> 00:26:54.735
You know that.

00:27:05.815 --> 00:27:07.245
He's lost his mind over a woman,

00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:10.385
and now he wants to disown his own mother.

00:27:11.015 --> 00:27:14.625
They say raising a son only gets you stabbed in the back.

00:27:15.395 --> 00:27:20.395
Oh, it's so unfair. This is just heartbreaking.

00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:25.095
It's so unfair.

00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:29.805
Let go of me. Are you going to let go or not?

00:27:30.705 --> 00:27:32.305
I said, let go! Let go!

00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:34.475
I told you to let go.

00:27:43.785 --> 00:27:45.255
I'll apologise for my mother.

00:27:47.055 --> 00:27:48.695
- I'm sorry. - Don't.

00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:51.555
What good is an apology after the damage has been done?

00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:54.625
Don't ever let this happen again.

00:27:55.935 --> 00:27:57.165
Jae In.

00:27:57.495 --> 00:27:58.495
Let go!

00:28:02.075 --> 00:28:05.475
Can't I come back to you?

00:28:10.915 --> 00:28:13.885
I've been thinking about when I was the happiest.

00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:19.025
It was when I was with you and our son, Eun Ho.

00:28:22.425 --> 00:28:24.095
I didn't realise that was happiness back then.

00:28:26.165 --> 00:28:27.425
It was too peaceful...

00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:29.735
and too ordinary.

00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:33.005
I didn't see it as true happiness.

00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:38.635
I've only just realised that.

00:28:40.505 --> 00:28:41.505
That happiness.

00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:43.745
Who shattered it?

00:28:45.415 --> 00:28:46.845
It was you, Hwang Gi Chan.

00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:54.925
Nothing else matters to me anymore, Jae In.

00:28:55.995 --> 00:28:57.095
All I need is you.

00:28:59.525 --> 00:29:01.395
If we could just go back to the way things were,

00:29:02.535 --> 00:29:03.995
I would give up everything.

00:29:04.595 --> 00:29:06.205
Please give me one more chance.

00:29:07.965 --> 00:29:10.635
You've got some nerve.

00:29:11.935 --> 00:29:13.445
After everything you've done,

00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:15.515
a chance?

00:29:22.685 --> 00:29:24.955
All right, fine.

00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:29.525
Go to the police, confess it all, and face the consequences.

00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:33.565
Asking for a second chance without being punished...

00:29:34.325 --> 00:29:36.235
just seems like a cheap trick to avoid responsibility.

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:40.665
I'll do it.

00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:44.805
If that's what you want, then I have to.

00:29:48.005 --> 00:29:49.715
I'll confess the crimes I've committed so far...

00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:52.115
and turn myself in.

00:29:53.445 --> 00:29:54.815
Do you even realise...

00:29:56.415 --> 00:29:57.585
what you're saying right now?

00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:01.325
To pay for my crimes,

00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:03.725
it might take several years.

00:30:06.225 --> 00:30:07.565
I have no right, but will you wait for me?

00:30:10.295 --> 00:30:11.295
Then,

00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:14.335
give me one more chance.

00:30:19.045 --> 00:30:20.445
Talk is cheap.

00:30:21.675 --> 00:30:22.975
I don't believe in empty promises.

00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:24.615
I'll show you.

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.545
I'll prove that I mean it.

00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:42.125
(Divorce Papers)

00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:49.005
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:30:49.375 --> 00:30:50.805
I am not getting a divorce!

00:30:51.235 --> 00:30:52.605
Then, I'm filing for divorce.

00:30:53.245 --> 00:30:54.545
I've already spoken to my lawyer.

00:30:55.405 --> 00:30:56.475
Honey.

00:30:56.515 --> 00:30:58.375
I'm taking custody of Ji Ho.

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:01.385
If you don't want to drag this out in a messy court battle,

00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:04.285
your best option is to take the settlement money...

00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:05.285
and walk away.

00:31:05.685 --> 00:31:07.255
You can't dump me.

00:31:07.655 --> 00:31:08.895
You can never get rid of me!

00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:11.725
Have you forgotten what I know?

00:31:12.025 --> 00:31:14.525
If you're planning to blackmail me over Kim Do Hee's accident...

00:31:14.525 --> 00:31:15.965
The original dashcam footage.

00:31:17.035 --> 00:31:19.705
I have it. Have you forgotten?

00:31:28.345 --> 00:31:32.145
(Rear Camera)

00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:36.555
If I hand this over to the police,

00:31:36.915 --> 00:31:39.025
it's an open-and-shut case. You're going to prison.

00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:42.425
So drop the idea of filing for divorce.

00:31:44.925 --> 00:31:45.925
I don't care.

00:31:46.995 --> 00:31:47.995
What?

00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:50.235
Send that footage to Jae In,

00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:52.195
or send it to the prosecution.

00:31:52.865 --> 00:31:55.505
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:00.275
I'm going to turn myself in.

00:32:03.275 --> 00:32:04.445
Are you crazy?

00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:07.885
Are you out of your mind? Why are you suddenly doing this?

00:32:14.455 --> 00:32:15.795
I've said my piece.

00:32:16.855 --> 00:32:18.095
You decide what to do.

00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:29.635
Doctor, I'm very busy today.

00:32:30.635 --> 00:32:31.835
Could you please just write the prescription?

00:32:34.805 --> 00:32:37.915
First, I need to discuss your test results.

00:32:39.285 --> 00:32:41.385
Is my stomach ulcer that bad?

00:32:43.085 --> 00:32:46.325
We found a tumour in your stomach, so we performed a biopsy.

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:51.225
And?

00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:58.365
You have terminal stomach cancer.

00:33:42.845 --> 00:33:46.785
(Queen's House)

00:33:47.085 --> 00:33:48.085
Are you serious?

00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:50.015
Do I look like I'm kidding?

00:33:50.715 --> 00:33:52.015
Let me do it again, properly.

00:33:52.355 --> 00:33:53.425
Just give me some time.

00:33:54.785 --> 00:33:56.695
Sure. No pressure.

00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:58.325
Did you tell Hwang Gi Chan...

00:33:58.795 --> 00:34:00.895
that he's not Ji Ho's biological father?

00:34:02.095 --> 00:34:03.465
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:05.195
He is Gi Chan's son.

00:34:06.805 --> 00:34:08.735
Good. Keep telling yourself that.

00:34:09.305 --> 00:34:10.575
That’s what makes you, Se Ri.

00:34:10.975 --> 00:34:15.305
The mailman just dropped this off. He said it was for you, Jae In.

00:34:16.915 --> 00:34:18.015
Who on earth did this?

00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:20.915
Jae In, are you okay?
