The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.990
Mina

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.060
Mina, are you okay?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.330
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.990
What are you doing?

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.690
I want to end this.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830
But always fail

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.660
What are you doing?

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.210
You were obviously at home, why didn't you show up for dinner?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.190
Isn't this for euthanasia?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.530
You're not thinking of committing suicide, are you?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.930
-No, it's not suicide. -What is it?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.560
Do you want to kill someone?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.330
I want to kill someone

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.030
But not murder.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.590
Didn't you say

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.610
For those who are in too much pain, death may be a better option.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.930
Too dangerous

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.790
Let me take you to the hospital.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.260
It's hell

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.690
I don't want to live at all

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.010
Every minute and every second is so painful

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.230
Please help me

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.290
You said you lived in this neighborhood as a child, right?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.030
Yes

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.290
At that time

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.990
Even when our family was the poorest

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.980
But it is also the happiest

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.030
Thank you, brother.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.430
Go out and see if there's anyone in the alley.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.930
It shouldn't be too long

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.560
Goodbye

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.660
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.660
My ex-girlfriend

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.560
-=Episode 7=-

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.430
Mina

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.140
I killed him.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.360
So you move aside. I don't need a lawyer.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.060
Be more awake

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.830
Yu Suzhen is now arrested because of Lee Yunxi's death.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.510
Even if you admit your ex-girlfriend's problem, nothing will change.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.170
I started it. I've said it several times.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.630
From the beginning, I was the one who brought the medicine.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.780
I'm going to say that I ordered everything.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.860
If you want to turn yourself in, just make the call yourself.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.950
- What... - Even though you don't want to tell any family members

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.450
But your sister is getting married at the end of this month

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.260
Your parents gave me a huge sum of money to defend you.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.900
Not because I believe you're not taking drugs.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.580
It's to prevent you from being arrested before your sister gets married.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.810
Although I don't want to see you again

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.880
But if you are still my brother, try to live a quiet life.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.860
This is what your sister wanted me to convey to you.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.130
You can go back now

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.130
Why did you let me go suddenly?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.230
Because someone appeared who claimed to have killed Ms. Lee Yun-hee

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.160
Is that Father Yang?

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.360
How was he killed?

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.150
Used medicine

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.530
What medicine was used?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.110
I'm not sure about that, it's just...

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.790
I used all kinds of medicines in the hospital

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.960
Usually used by doctors in emergencies

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.760
I did just that.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.860
I don't even know what medicine it is.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.160
Just say you are a criminal?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.700
Because I was too panicked.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.230
Lee Yoon Hee is in so much pain

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.190
In a hurry, I just...

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.610
priest

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.530
Please wake up

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.010
I am the one who committed the crime

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.330
right

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.730
I killed him.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.210
According to the investigation principles, since someone has surrendered,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.590
We will take release measures first

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.690
Not a priest

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.030
So you're going to admit that you killed Ms. Lee Yoon-hee?

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.160
Father Yang did not kill anyone

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.660
If you don't admit that you killed him

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.330
Just go back first

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.390
You know the priest didn't kill anyone.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.310
You feel you are not guilty anyway.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.630
Yu Suzhen

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.940
Insist that what you do is not a sin

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.030
So what can you do yourself?

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.160
You didn't think about it because of your wrong belief

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.450
Will it hurt the people around you?

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.890
I'll be here until the autopsy results come back.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.780
Are you sure about the autopsy results?

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.290
Won't Bafron appear?

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.260
Is it out?

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:45.270
Although multiple drugs were detected, their concentrations were not directly associated with the cause of death.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.180
Damn

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.280
Please go back

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.690
The priest will be released soon anyway.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.030
Thanks a lot

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.130
Yu Suzhen, you now

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.210
Missed the last chance to stop

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.990
I don't plan to stop

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.930
Ah, have you seen Xiaosong?

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.260
So the child is not here?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.830
I probably didn't eat lunch either.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.090
I'll look for it again

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.170
Ah, okay

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.540
Why are you here?

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.660
Aren't you hungry?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.590
Are you scared?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.190
My sister has a brother

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.890
The twin brother who was born 5 minutes earlier

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.890
We often hide here when we encounter scary things.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.830
But my brother told me

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.290
When I'm scared, it's better to hide in a place like this

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.890
Go out and play with friends

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.690
It's better to be less afraid.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.030
How about it

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.780
Do you want to go out with your sister?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.010
careful

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.460
Under the Black Sun

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.890
staggering

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.860
I am gradually melting

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.290
Although ridiculed

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.360
Also need to help

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.430
The fallen body stood up

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.460
Go find you and embark on a journey

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.840
-Geon-soo -Geon-soo Geon-soo

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.030
Jianzhu

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.410
-Call the police now -Jianzhu

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.610
Dr. Yu

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.310
Did you know Ye Na has a twin brother?

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.330
He often stayed in our hospital when he was a child.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.930
You should recognize it when you see its face.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.360
Yeah, I think I've seen it too.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.160
But what's wrong

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.010
That person was taken to the emergency room and is now hospitalized.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.190
Say I want to see you

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.660
Ye-na's brother?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.360
He seems unaware that Ye-na resigned

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.280
I seem to want to ask this

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.760
Doctor, you and Ye-na are doing volunteer work together.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.260
We have some friendship, right?

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.080
I didn't know Ye Na resigned.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.740
This matter

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.900
It's best to let Ye Na tell you in person

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:17.880
OK

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.750
But today has nothing to do with Ye-na

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.880
I have something to tell you

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.640
You should go through Ye Na

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.150
Did you know I have cystic fibrosis?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.420
Cystic Fibrosis: A hereditary systemic disease that primarily causes widespread dysfunction of the exocrine glands.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.960
Um

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.310
You probably know there are many complications.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.700
Then I'll be frank.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.140
I had a checkup because I was in severe pain recently.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.410
The doctor said I have three months left.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.810
Doesn't Ye-na know?

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.470
right

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.740
I know what Ye-na and you are doing

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.220
Once when she was taking care of a patient

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.740
Didn't take the 2G phone away

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.310
But I don't mean to blame you at all

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.920
Although it sounds like a quibble

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.070
We only treat

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.040
Patients whose pain cannot be controlled by analgesics

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.750
Deep distress

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.610
I know your principles very well.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.100
So from the moment I decided to meet you

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.420
I've been preparing.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.930
I know what information is needed

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.890
Please treat me

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.920
Do that treatment too.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.250
-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.610
Hello

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.030
-Hello. -You're here.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.950
Are you okay?
I'm fine

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.760
Are you worried about me?

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.470
No

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.670
You look okay. That's great.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.700
Really? Thank you.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.460
You received a lot of donations.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.580
I received a lot this time

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.380
We need to sort it out.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.660
Give these to those in need

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.460
yes

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.520
By the way, where is Xiaosong?

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.120
Xiaosong, do you want to eat this?

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.090
Wow what is this

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.500
Don't move

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.740
-Will it be uncomfortable to carry me on your back? -I told you not to move.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.590
This is my mother's

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:37.920
Komatsu

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.820
sorry

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.100
I won't do it without Ye-na's consent.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.120
Ye-na is raising money for my lung transplant.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.190
But I won't do it just because I know him.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.580
Isn't this reverse discrimination?

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.150
Ye-na and I started this together.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.620
She only performs that treatment on patients who agree.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.970
You should convince Ye Na first.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.140
-Dr. Yu -I know you grew up without parents

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.440
I grew up with Ye-na

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.020
The Ye-na I know

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.760
I want nothing more than to take care of you.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.570
If she knew this was your decision alone

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.740
She'll be shocked.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.730
For your choice

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.040
Ye-na needs to know

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.850
But you know she won't accept it.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.670
sorry

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.290
Choi Gun-soo

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:06.790
Jianzhu

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.200
Received a report from an insider tonight

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.960
There are goods entering the country under the name of Jin Shijian

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.260
Jin Shijian should show up

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.620
Must catch him

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.800
Don't worry about it

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.890
Since the program about Kim Si-kyung's arrest was broadcast

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.150
There have been many prank calls reported in his name.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.670
In fact, I missed out several times because of this reason.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.330
But this time the report is very specific.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.600
I think I still need to confirm.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.700
The Narcotics Bureau has confirmed

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.640
If such a large amount of drugs arrives

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.200
There should be rumors from some bigwigs, but there is none.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.130
The guy who tried to stowaway but failed

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.440
He also calls himself Jin Shijian.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.060
Since he is a big shot and is on the news

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.110
That guy wants to use Jin Shijian's name

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.420
There is no guarantee that Baflon will arrive.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.270
Let the Narcotics Department handle the matter regarding Bafron.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.660
You should track down Jin Shijian's missing car.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.350
Don't you still have the vehicle's movement route?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:23.780
yes

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.760
If you really want to confirm

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.110
Your group can go and confirm it.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.540
If there is a suspicious situation

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.730
You can invite support at will.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.150
Thanks

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.620
-=Detective Fu Zhexiu=-

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.120
Hey, Detective Husband

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.210
This is the last chance

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.530
Please persuade Choi Dae-hyun

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.260
So we can capture Yu Suzhen on the spot

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.220
good

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.840
Youmei, Mom has to go out for a while

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.110
The porridge is here. Remember to eat it.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.090
Choi Dae-hyun, where are you?

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.340
Now Ye-na doesn't know about her brother's condition.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.130
right

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.490
She is so good to her brother.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.480
But she hasn't come yet

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.600
Maybe she doesn't even know her brother is in the hospital here.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.500
Do you want me to contact Ye-na?

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.380
Looks like he needs a guardian.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.710
I'll go find her after get off work.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.640
That's better

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.800
If I tell her about her brother's condition

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.770
She should be more receptive.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.940
No matter how I explain it, it will be hard for her to accept it.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.040
Xiaosong: Do you like this dress?

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.540
Thank you for buying me clothes

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.250
I'll buy you more fitting clothes later.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.780
Here, drink it.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.620
Are you crazy?

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.360
How can you bring your children?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.860
She is Lee Yoon-hee's daughter

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.540
She has some separation anxiety because of the shock.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.500
So I had to bring her here.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.900
I think you're the one with separation anxiety.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.950
Right

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.470
The unmarried...

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.720
Can't adopt a child? Is it still not possible now?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.070
Even if they are married, they will not give it to drug offenders.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.690
Opportunities to adopt a child are not available in any country.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.420
If you want to take care of her

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.860
You should know that you can't be arrested by the police.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.990
The police said they'll give you one more chance.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.910
If you're willing to help, you can get away with it.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.020
Forget it. This matter has already been decided.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.170
Think about it carefully

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.110
I think compared to Yu Suzhen

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.870
This child seems to need you more now

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.050
You are here

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.560
Just in case, I didn't tell you.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.370
The ward where patient Lee Yun-hee stayed that day has been tidied up.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.030
All the items she used were disinfected and discarded.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:55.990
Because I think it would be strange if the location of the mobile O2 was changed

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.660
Portable O2: Portable oxygen cylinder

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.810
So I dealt with it all.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.360
Thanks

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.850
Ye Na

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.710
Um

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.040
Your brother is in our hospital now because he fainted.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.350
Is it serious?

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.930
Why don't you call me if you feel bad?

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.340
Was he taken to the hospital alone?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.280
You know there are a lot of complications with cystic fibrosis, right?

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.250
Um

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.070
Not just the lungs

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.120
Even pancreatic function will gradually decline

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.510
Are there any complications with the pancreas?

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.410
Or has it turned into cancer?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.500
No wonder I felt he was deliberately ignoring my calls recently.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.560
Maybe it's because you can't tell me this.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.880
Ye Na

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.000
Um

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.140
Jianzhu

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:15.610
Know what we are doing

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.040
besides

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.100
He wants us to do it to him.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.720
The treatment we are currently doing

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.780
Can't

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.680
Can't

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.070
I know you're shocked.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.040
But the person who is suffering the most right now is Jianzhu

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.380
You won't promise him, right?

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:43.460
No

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.950
I told him I wouldn't do it without your consent.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.540
What are you talking about? You definitely can't agree with it.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.450
Even if it's for my own good

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.890
You have to tell him too

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.580
You will find a way to save him.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.640
sorry

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.540
I know you're feeling bad.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.290
But you'd better communicate with Jianzhu

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.730
He is the most miserable person right now.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.560
sorry

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.160
Because of me, you are tired

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.900
I have something to tell you

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.970
I'll take care of Li Yunxi's daughter for the time being.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.720
Compared to a hospital or a church

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.730
The child might be more comfortable living in my house.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.540
Dr. Yu

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.560
You don't have to come to our hospital anymore.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.980
You behaved in a misleading way

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.680
And it caused a lot of trouble to the surrounding area

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.130
I mean you did something you shouldn't have done.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.220
I don't want the patients in our hospital and the nuns

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.360
They suffered embarrassment because of you

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.240
So don't come to this hospital anymore.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.350
Got it?

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.070
in addition

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.890
You must never do anything that causes misunderstanding again.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.530
What if that wasn't a misunderstanding?

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.830
Don't do

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.360
Okay

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.110
Dr. Yu

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.770
You can't get involved in this kind of thing anymore.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.180
If the police said

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.730
I really did it.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.960
I think it's your mistake

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.640
right

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.560
If you escape from reality, will you feel comfortable?

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.610
Death is God's domain

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.970
People cannot interfere

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.370
Father, you also said many last prayers.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.670
It should be clear

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.570
Before death

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.270
How many patients have experienced torture?

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.490
Because of fear of others' blame

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.740
Can you easily ignore such pain?

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.820
We pretend not to know

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.540
Do those who experience pain disappear?

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.790
This is committing a sin

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.140
I'll tell you again

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.490
If this happens again

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.870
I will report you.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.120
I will testify

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.790
so

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.540
Please don't do it again

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.940
You are still as irresponsible as you were then.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.920
The first person my mother turns to for help

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.320
It's you, Father

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.740
You ignored her request then, didn't you?

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.440
Until I was young, I wanted to help my mother

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.290
What are you doing there?

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.140
Eh? What?

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.040
What did you say

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.240
I was scared to death

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.940
I asked you what you were doing there.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.170
Oh Oh

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.840
I'm drinking water

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.390
Too thirsty

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.540
What are you doing

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.440
Ouch

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.670
What are you doing?

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.890
Why are you drinking so fast?

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.120
come on

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.790
The information has come again. The time and place have changed.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.990
The report is very specific

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.280
Even the informant knew that in Jin Shijian's car

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.520
-=Incheon Port 3-A was expected to conduct drug trafficking at 10:10 PM on November 18th. At the Royal Elite construction site in Seojin-dong, Bunseong City, drug trafficking was expected to occur at 9:30 PM on November 18th. The police officer's lost drugs found in Kim Si-mi's car were also the work of them.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.690
Police found drugs they lost

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.220
But the drug squad

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.140
I think this information itself is false

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.620
They asked us to dig some more.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.470
The disappearance of Jin Shijian

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.790
No, I heard they are crazy about the performance.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.040
Why do you say such strange things?

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.740
The current situation is very strange

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.040
Jin Shijian takes the drugs lost by the police

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.790
This is also very strange

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.770
Is there an undercover thief?

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.870
If the drug squad doesn't go

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720
Let's go

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.570
The drug squad has determined it's fake.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.120
The bureau will not provide additional personnel

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.520
It's too dangerous for us to go alone

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.540
Go to the scene first and call for support if needed.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.090
Let's go by ourselves

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.740
Information leaks may also occur within the police force

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.540
Let's pretend we're leaving get off work early.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.640
Meet again later

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.190
no

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.890
Let's do it

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.440
no

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.690
Let's do it

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.290
I told you no, where are you going?

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.420
Brother, where do you go every day?

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.840
Let's do it

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.990
Get off at Komatsu. Be careful.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.570
-Hey. -Okay.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.370
Xiaosong, you got something stuck here.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.090
- Where? - It's beautiful.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.540
Wow, Xiaosong has become prettier.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.140
We went to the department store

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.470
I was just waiting for you.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.970
I plan to take Xiaosong away

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.020
Now?

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.720
- So fast? - Yeah

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.470
It's better to go to our house than stay here.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.090
Ah, yes.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.120
And Jae-yeon is here, so this is more suitable

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.670
Komatsu

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.970
Uncle will pick you up tomorrow

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.390
You stay at your aunt's house.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.470
Can I take Xiaosong out tomorrow?

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.040
Xiaosong will be bored at home after the children go to school.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.290
Okay, I'll tell Auntie.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.640
Where did Ye-na go?

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.120
Ye-na brother entrusted me with a task

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.690
Does Ye-na know?

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:19.670
Um

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.320
She is in pain now

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.220
Why didn't you tell me

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.840
Complications occurred

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.270
sorry

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.920
What's there to apologize for?

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:48.740
Why do you apologize for everything?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.270
I feel even more guilty if I didn't find it.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.020
I'll go and find out starting tomorrow.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.790
If we search, we may find new treatments.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.040
Can I stop treatment?

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.220
sorry

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.270
I really now

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.640
I don't want to continue

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.590
Why

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.790
Why

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.020
Why do you say such depressing words?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.840
Don't you remember your childhood?

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.470
The hospital said you won't live past 10.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.270
But you're still alive

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.220
Ask again

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.940
Maybe a miracle will happen.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.090
It's a miracle that I'm still alive

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.020
It's the miracle you created

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.370
But

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.470
I hate miracles now.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.720
I want to be peaceful

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.240
Why do you think so?

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.770
You are a very strong person

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.340
Haven't you persevered through treatments more painful than this?

00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.990
Why do you suddenly give up?

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.940
Is it because you are too tired?

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.420
Ye-na, please

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.270
Don't let me continue treatment.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.940
You're going too far.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.070
How did I survive to this day?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.840
You and I to Mom...

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.620
We were born from our mother's womb on the same day.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.890
How did we survive together till today?

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.320
How could you do this to me?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.990
How can you say this to me so easily?

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.640
What am I to you?

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.370
Sorry, Ye-na

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.120
- That's not the case. - Never mind.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.320
Don't say that again.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.830
-=Lee Yoon Hee=-

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.440
There is no photo of my mother.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.570
Next time you come

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.670
Xiaosong, please draw your mother's face.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.290
Mom is no longer in pain here and can rest well.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.570
So

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.320
You can come here when you miss your mother.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.890
Is this Mom's room from now on?

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.770
Yes

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.020
Will I live here in the future?

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.320
oh...

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.970
This is a place where people like my mother take a break.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.940
But Komatsu is more interested in rest

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.320
Have to play and learn

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.190
There's a lot to do

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.370
so

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.020
Come with me to our house.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.270
Auntie, is this your home?

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.890
Um

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.920
I just want to go back to my home

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.570
We have an older sister and an older brother in our family.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.990
-Sister? -Yeah

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.140
A very smart and kind sister

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.240
Besides, my brother and you, Xiaosong, are similar in age.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.140
It must be fun to play together

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.320
To my older sister and older brother, I am their aunt.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.750
But for Komatsu

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.120
I'll be your mother

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.590
I made an agreement with your mother.

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:55.970
I will take good care of you

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.340
Dear mother, let me comb your hair

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.090
Okay, what hairstyle do you want?

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.890
Are you reluctant to leave because you're worried about your children?

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.870
I made a promise with you

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.390
I will take good care of the children

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.120
You can go without worry

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.590
So don't worry

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.820
Come to our house

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.440
I received a call from a social worker.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.190
Yes, I received the call too.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.490
Yu Suzhen, are you planning to live with your child?

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:03.570
Yes

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.540
Even if it's temporary, you still have to meet the guardian requirements.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.920
Problems may arise

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.170
I know

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.020
but

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.720
For the children

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.870
During this time, I think I should take care of her.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.720
Help take care of children

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.640
Will it ease your guilt?

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.170
Even though you want to help them

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.190
But the child grew up and knew about this.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.620
Do you think she won't blame you?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.490
I don't care

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.220
I don't expect her not to blame me.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.520
Just for now

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.170
Our home is the safest place for children

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.590
The social worker will contact you in a while.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.820
You can't live with her forever.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.940
There will be difficulties, but we will always find a way.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.370
Just a few hours ago

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.440
You are still a suspect in Lee Yoon-hee's death

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.670
You can think I'm trying to avoid suspicion.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.690
Only then did such behavior

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.940
But today

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.640
Please let me take the child home.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.790
Please

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.470
-Hey -Brother

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.720
I have arrived

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.970
When will you come

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:46.440
-=Lee Yoon Hee, My Mom=-

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.470
Hello, Huilin, it's me.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.770
The representative who played golf with us last time

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.090
Patients with advanced gastric cancer

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.570
Representative Chen Yingxiu

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.070
Did that person go to Switzerland?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.420
Didn't go

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.420
His condition suddenly worsened and he was unable to make the trip.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.920
There was no possibility of this from the beginning

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.690
Dragging my sick body to Switzerland for examination and waiting for the results

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.340
But why am I suddenly curious about Chen's status?

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.370
Ah, that

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.530
I think we can use Barfron to help him.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.740
What

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.060
Didn't you say before that Bafron was hell?

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.190
Isn't it hell?

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.830
I found a way to perfectly control Barfron.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.650
A powerful person

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.520
A doctor

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.380
Aunt

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.560
I'll take Xiaosong to my room to sleep.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.050
You often have to go to work at night anyway

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.360
There is Komatsu

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.570
Cai Yun won't let me play with him

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.550
So I will be more comfortable

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.980
You've always been a great help to me.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.870
Thanks

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.230
You guys hide for a while

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.920
- What are you doing? - Just playing hide and seek.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.190
I told you to open the door, bitch

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.870
Before mom opens the door for you

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.870
You absolutely cannot come out, got it?

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.230
I told you to open the door

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.740
Open the door, bitch

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.390
Hello

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.290
Why don't you open the door for me?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.900
Open the door for me

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.250
Hello

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.500
Open the door

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.700
You damn bitch

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.870
- What are you doing? - Bear with it.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.870
Didn't we play enough today?

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.170
Isn't it enough?

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.000
- Do you want to die today? - Gun-soo's dad

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.520
- Do you want to die? - Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.490
Do you want to die?

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.600
Do you want to die?

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.410
Help!

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.810
Hello

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.410
Dad is here

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.460
Jianzhu

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.960
come over

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.330
Open the door

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.790
Why don't you open the door?

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.800
- You guys, I'm going to kill you all today. - You hide for a while.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.790
Open the door quickly

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.660
- Gun-soo, Ye-na, just treat it as a game of hide-and-seek

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.980
You must not come out before your brother opens the door for you

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.960
- You guys, - Got it.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.350
I'm going to kill you all today.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.430
Open the door, brat!

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:21.750
These guys are just brats.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.580
What are you glaring at, you little brat?

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.890
Hey, brat

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.450
Hey, brat

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.640
You little bastard, I'm your dad.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.120
- You little bastard. - What should I do?

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.540
-Dad, stop hitting me. -I'm going to kill you today.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.560
Brat

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.390
How dare you stare at me, you little brat?

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.680
elder brother

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.020
It's okay

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.340
-It's okay. It's okay. -Brother

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.800
sorry

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.790
I wonder how I'm going to live without you.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.800
So I got angry first

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.430
You did a great job

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:41.840
Do whatever you want, just live on.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.810
There's nothing I want to do

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.100
I said I would live happily with you forever

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.580
That's my wish

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.570
Hello

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.970
I will only make you suffer. What good is a brother like me?

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:02.570
Of course

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.960
After all, you are my brother.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.060
Of course

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.250
sorry

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.010
I'm sorry, brother.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.440
you

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.880
Do you really not want to continue?

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.310
Is it true?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.000
Very urgent

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.730
It's really urgent

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:58.310
I really want to do that

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.330
Coming, coming, coming

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.300
Is it him?

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.050
What's with the yellow hair?

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.450
Are you doing well?
Um

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.040
By the way, the second one is a son, right?

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.840
It's my daughter

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.790
I thought it was my son when I saw the photo

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.190
Is this it?

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.430
Damn

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.840
Opened Opened Opened

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.450
Hey, hey, hey, it's drugs, right?

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.950
What are you doing?

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:30.840
What is this?

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.500
-Have you ordered a midnight snack? -No

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.390
Is this a midnight snack?

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:39.430
What?

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.430
Hey, yellow hair

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.550
Wow

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.970
one two three

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.430
Just three people?
Um

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.190
Hello, arrest team

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.350
Arrest Team

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.820
Damn

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.420
Want to call for backup?

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.540
Didn't you just call?

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.310
No, you didn't say anything, so I...

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.590
Damn

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.170
how

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:08.210
Are you scared?

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.650
The helicopter arrived a little late.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.720
Wow, so many

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:16.410
-What? -Hey, come on.
- Up - Good

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.630
Damn

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.060
It hurts, you little bastard

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:25.980
Be gentle

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.780
Hey, take it away. Take it away.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.570
Damn it hurts, it hurts, you little brat

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.470
pain

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.540
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.770
Run, walk, walk

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.680
It hurts, little bastard. It hurts a lot.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.050
Blocked

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.010
Something is flying over here. What is it?

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.780
Hello, hello, what are you doing?

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.130
Hey, hey, hey, reverse, reverse, reverse

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.740
Can't open, can't open, bad boy, reverse, reverse

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.300
Car car car reverse reverse reverse

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.880
Parking brat

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.380
Get off, brat!

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.720
What are you doing?

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:44.630
rush out

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.240
I was scared to death. Damn it.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.780
You crazy person

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.580
Damn

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.200
Brother Cheol-soo

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.350
Daojun

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.300
Hey, you little bastard

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:26.890
Damn

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.660
That's why I asked you to apply for support.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.970
It's different from the movie.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.540
Damn, can it be the same?

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.860
Damn

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.240
Get in the car

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.420
Damn

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.360
Hey, little bastards!

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.360
Damn, should have used it earlier.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.300
-Hello. -Hello.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:09.940
Hello, are you okay?

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.550
Why are there so many people?

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:20.130
Hello, hurry up. Which way is it?

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.650
Hello, there's a normal vehicle ahead. Sorry.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.870
sorry

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.120
Brother, over there, over there, in front, in front

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.080
The cop guy is really

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.110
Parking brat

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.300
I told you to stop.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.720
Bro, I bumped into you.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.120
-Stop him, stop him, stop him, stop him, stop him -I told you to stop, Campanula

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.990
If it were you, could you park the car?

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.410
Block him

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.140
Brat, block him, block him

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.790
- I told you to stop. - In front. In front.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.800
What are you doing?

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.890
Re-posted it

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.420
Follow me, boy.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.550
Step on the gas. Step on the gas.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.230
Go to hell. Go to hell.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.420
Brother is in front

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.930
Oh, damn!

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.460
Damn

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.100
Although no one caught up

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.770
But I got the medicine

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.430
Maybe we can find some clues.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.780
There's no news from anywhere in the drug world.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:22.750
They showed up

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.520
No, there are so many drugs in Korea.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.370
Is this a deliberately fake survey?

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.100
this

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.280
Need to confirm again

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.640
It sounds like this indeed

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.600
-Hello -Detective Pan

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.860
2123 vehicles on National Highway 1034

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.290
Caught by surveillance camera

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.550
Hello, Ji-hoon

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.420
-=Emergency Room/CT=-

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.980
Received the commission

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.620
I don't have any medicine right now, so I can't accept the commission.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.280
But the patient is anxious

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.500
The patient is a 27-year-old male born in 1998.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.090
He has male fibrosis.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:34.900
Because of complications, time is running out.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.210
The patient has been suffering because his family opposes euthanasia.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.890
Now I have convinced my family and commissioned

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:51.330
Who is the client?

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.530
It's my brother

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.360
Finally, it was captured by surveillance

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.960
-=Surveillance filming=-

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.120
The 27NA2123 vehicle

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.910
The last time I was photographed was on this road

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.630
Start from this intersection

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.520
No longer captured by surveillance.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:21.000
Have you found anything new since then?

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.410
Um, about 80 kilometers away from here

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:25.400
From there, there is monitoring

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.500
But after that, the roads on both sides

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.060
No 2123 cars have been photographed

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.850
Here

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.310
There is a big lake here

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:37.440
Then let's go over here and take a look.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.500
The car disappeared within a radius of 100 kilometers.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.840
It can only go in that direction.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:43.940
yes

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.800
Please send divers here.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.600
I'll text you the location.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.000
Are you mentally prepared?

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.850
My brother is very urgent

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.820
And you

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:44.060
Because I know this time

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.620
It's really hard for me.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.440
So I promised to do it for him.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.010
Am I doing it right?

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.950
I know how hard it is for you

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.490
Maybe you'll keep thinking about this question.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.300
Is this my true heart?

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:25.500
Did I do the right thing then?

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.570
Jianzhu

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.970
Since I got sick

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:40.600
Maybe I never had a good night's sleep.

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:50.600
Ye Na

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.760
When I was a child

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:59.230
Do you know what choice my mother made?

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.780
My mother has wanted to die all her life.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.580
When she finally got what she wanted

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:28.330
Although I was very sad, I also blamed her

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:35.110
She never considered us who were left in this world.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.090
But it's not like that

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.660
My mother prepared in advance

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.240
For the daughter left behind

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.580
I only knew it then

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.790
Maybe my mom

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.160
It's hard

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.940
Until I grew up

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.260
-=Mom, I'm sorry, I love you=-

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.730
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:21.940
I love you

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.830
That's when I felt so sorry for her.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.040
Because I let the sick worry about me

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.880
Jianzhu was able to endure such a difficult treatment process

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.240
Maybe because I'm worried about you being left alone

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:54.800
What we can do

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.380
When the one we love leaves

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.300
Don't let them worry about us

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:08.660
Only that one

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.200
good

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:27.380
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.130
I have to help Ye-na's brother.

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.370
Ye Na also agreed

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:32.050
Do you have to meet that person?

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:33.740
You stinky girl

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:36.300
Do you want to have a funeral before you die?

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.530
Good. The funeral was nice.

00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:40.820
-How much can you give? -How much can you give?

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.770
I'm almost dead, why am I still so reluctant?

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.280
It really starts from now on

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.970
Do as I say

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.980
It's like becoming a kind killer.

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.160
The location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle has been confirmed

00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.140
What did you do again?
