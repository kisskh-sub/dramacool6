00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:02.544
(Episode 93)

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.894
I thought I turned off my laptop, so why am I getting a chat notice?

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.864
Is there a rule that only designers get to use the expensive ones?

00:00:19.494 --> 00:00:21.364
I have to run a lot of programs too.

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.134
Don't tell me, Kang Jae In...

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:38.844
Found it!

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:41.884
H and K Company's duplicate contract.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.994
(Overseas Factory Establishment Contract)

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.494
(Overseas Factory Establishment Contract)

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.204
(Overseas Factory Establishment Contract)

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:12.144
- No! - Let go! I said, let go!

00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:19.984
Do you think this makes what you two did just go away?

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:21.694
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.064
The H and K Company's duplicate contract.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:28.334
You don't have any proof, so stop spouting nonsense!

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:31.034
Your words are meaningless!

00:01:33.204 --> 00:01:34.834
I guess you have to be this shameless...

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.474
to commit a crime and be proud.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:39.144
Thank you.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:43.044
You've really snapped me back to my senses.

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:45.944
Kang Jae In, don't mess with me.

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:47.454
You saw for yourself.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:49.054
You can't beat me.

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:50.784
Just you wait.

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:53.654
In the end, the one who'll get shattered to pieces...

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.394
won't be me, but you.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:12.644
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:15.614
Don't you dare say "love."

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:18.684
I gave you my everything.

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:22.154
I loved you unconditionally.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:27.094
And who was it that brutally stomped all over that love?

00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:29.254
It was you!

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:31.824
Tell me.

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:34.034
To me, the woman who loved you...

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:37.004
To my family...

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:38.664
To my dad...

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:40.434
To our Eun Ho...

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:43.004
Just what did you do?

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:45.344
Until the day you die,

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:50.244
you don't have the right to say that word.

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:01.124
What is it?

00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:03.454
Stop acting like you have no cares in the world.

00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:05.394
Do you have any idea what I just did?

00:03:05.724 --> 00:03:07.264
I just saved your neck.

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.704
Jae In almost had you cornered, and I'm the one who stopped her!

00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:16.034
- Okay, explain. - Jae In found the double contract.

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:18.804
Where?

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:21.274
She went through my email on my laptop and found it.

00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:22.914
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:25.484
How could you be so careless with it?

00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:28.314
I'd just gotten a new laptop, so I didn't have a chance to secure it.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:31.684
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't fired me.

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:35.494
Hwang Gi Chan, are you even listening to me?

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:38.624
I said I just saved your neck.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.734
- So what? - Take back that talk of a divorce.

00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:46.264
You would've been finished today if it weren't for me. Got it?

00:03:46.864 --> 00:03:47.934
Don't you ever get sick of this?

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:50.444
Every day, we yell and fight.

00:03:51.104 --> 00:03:52.644
Did we get married just to live like this?

00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.314
Then let's stop fighting.

00:03:54.614 --> 00:03:56.344
All you have to do is have a change of heart.

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.684
Delete everything saved in your email.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:04.324
You have to, for both our sakes.

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:06.994
I'll handle the rest, so stay out of it.

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:09.094
You can leave now.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.624
I'm about to leave for the day, too.

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:12.294
We're married.

00:04:12.624 --> 00:04:16.034
You're treating me like an employee, but I'm your wife.

00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:18.804
I will never, ever divorce you.

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:27.144
(Designer Kang Jae In)

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:33.684
Jae In, are you okay?

00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:36.584
Why are you here? I told you not to come.

00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:38.054
I couldn't even get the evidence.

00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:39.754
I came because I wanted to see you.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:42.324
Are you sure you're not hurt?

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:47.164
I guess I should have printed it out instead of emailing it.

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:50.664
I was in such a rush to get it sent.

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:54.104
I'm sorry.

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:57.074
What for?

00:04:58.574 --> 00:04:59.944
Your sister.

00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:03.574
I was desperate to find the evidence Do Hee was investigating,

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:06.214
but I ended up being of no help at all.

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:08.554
Don't say that.

00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:13.554
Finding the truth is important, but your safety is more important.

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:17.164
Never act on your own again.

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:18.764
Okay?

00:05:25.434 --> 00:05:28.974
I can't let Jae In dig any deeper into H and K Company.

00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:33.604
I have to figure something out so I don't disappoint.

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:37.844
Heading out for the day?

00:05:39.744 --> 00:05:40.914
Do you have a moment?

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.684
Mr. Lee and DH Holdings...

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:48.524
You two seem to be closer than I thought.

00:05:49.554 --> 00:05:51.794
I mean, sharing an office is no small thing.

00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:55.694
You seem to have something on your mind.

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:57.704
So let's not waste time. Just say what you mean.

00:05:58.564 --> 00:06:01.304
To be honest, my relationship with DH Holdings...

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:03.204
isn't exactly good.

00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:06.504
We were actually about to end our business relationship.

00:06:07.774 --> 00:06:09.644
We're maintaining the status quo for now.

00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:12.514
It's embarrassing to admit it, but that is how things are.

00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:16.684
So you think I might team up...

00:06:16.684 --> 00:06:19.424
with DH Holdings and put you at a disadvantage.

00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:21.124
I suppose you might think that.

00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:26.994
I'm not so sure.

00:06:27.494 --> 00:06:29.834
If that's what you think, I'm a little disappointed.

00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:32.604
I'm a professional.

00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:35.604
I don't let personal feelings get in the way of my work.

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:42.044
I was about to discuss the art with you.

00:06:42.514 --> 00:06:46.514
A couple of my VIP customers...

00:06:46.644 --> 00:06:49.054
are quite interested in one of your pieces.

00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:52.954
Does that mean a sale is possible?

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:54.824
Isn't that what I'm here for?

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:02.764
Okay, I will be in touch soon.

00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:09.734
They said they'd buy it no matter the cost.

00:07:11.304 --> 00:07:15.914
I'm counting on you. I'll make sure you're paid well.

00:07:16.374 --> 00:07:18.644
There's a right owner for each piece.

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:20.784
Just give it some time.

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:55.514
Gi Chan, play with me. I'm bored.

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:00.794
Are you playing "Guess the Animal?"

00:08:02.854 --> 00:08:03.864
Get out.

00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:06.594
Come on, let's play.

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.694
I said, get out! Just get out!

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.614
I must have built up a tolerance to my medication...

00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:30.354
because it doesn't seem to be working anymore.

00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:33.824
I see you've been eating poorly.

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:36.494
Any other symptoms besides stomach cramps?

00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:39.194
Stomach cramps, maybe...

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:41.334
The stomach pains have gotten a lot worse lately.

00:08:42.734 --> 00:08:44.634
I have indigestion and feel bloated.

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:47.804
I'm sure it's stress, but I feel so drained.

00:08:48.974 --> 00:08:50.674
Please prescribe something stronger.

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:54.574
Have you eaten anything today, by any chance?

00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:57.014
No.

00:08:57.144 --> 00:09:00.584
In that case, why don't we run some detailed tests?

00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:05.484
Can't you just give me a prescription?

00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:07.854
I'd rather not go through the hassle.

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:11.624
The medicine will only be effective if it's for the right symptoms.

00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:13.694
You're already here, so you might as well.

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.874
Are you going to skip work and just lie there moping all day?

00:09:27.174 --> 00:09:28.514
I'm not going.

00:09:28.614 --> 00:09:30.584
If you skip work, at least eat. Come on!

00:09:30.684 --> 00:09:32.044
I don't want to.

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:34.614
You brat. You'll starve to death if you don't eat.

00:09:34.714 --> 00:09:35.714
Is this a funeral?

00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:39.784
Even mourners eat at a funeral home! Why won't you eat?

00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:43.524
This is all your fault, Mom. How do you expect me to eat?

00:09:44.464 --> 00:09:46.264
You told me that man died in a fire.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.534
And you took the insurance money and ran, didn't you?

00:09:49.594 --> 00:09:53.934
I had no idea you'd done that. Seriously, I had no clue.

00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:57.174
And if you knew? What difference would it have made?

00:09:57.444 --> 00:09:58.874
It's already over and done with.

00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:01.944
When I think about how they bled us dry,

00:10:02.014 --> 00:10:03.944
that didn't cover what they really owe us.

00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:07.754
We should properly apologise to them, Mom.

00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:11.454
What they took was for pain and suffering.

00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:16.324
They couldn't press charges legally. So return the insurance cash...

00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:17.794
Shut your mouth!

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:21.334
See? This happens when you don't eat.

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:24.034
You're talking nonsense from weakness.

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:26.364
Return what? Are you kidding?

00:10:27.204 --> 00:10:29.904
Talking to you, I just realised I can't just be sitting here.

00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:32.404
I'm going to get back the money they took from me.

00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:35.414
Oh, Mom!

00:10:43.054 --> 00:10:46.084
Did I hear what I think I heard? What did you just say?

00:10:46.184 --> 00:10:47.994
I said give me my money! My money!

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:51.424
I may have helped myself to your husband's insurance money,

00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:53.594
but does that give you the right to take six million dollars from me?

00:10:54.294 --> 00:10:57.734
Your husband's insurance payout was less than that.

00:10:58.164 --> 00:11:00.464
I used that as start-up money, fine.

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:04.574
But the rest of the six million is my own money that I earned.

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:07.674
Even after you take your cut, you should at least give me half.

00:11:08.414 --> 00:11:10.544
I can't believe you're so evil.

00:11:10.944 --> 00:11:12.214
What? What did you say?

00:11:12.514 --> 00:11:16.354
I didn't want to sink to your level, so I was going to let it go.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:17.854
But listen here, Noh Sook Ja.

00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:21.524
You couldn't even pay the rent that I cut in half.

00:11:21.524 --> 00:11:23.194
You were mooching off of me!

00:11:23.454 --> 00:11:26.724
If you stole that much money then, we must factor in inflation, right?

00:11:27.264 --> 00:11:30.564
By that calculation, you'd be out on the street now.

00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:33.634
Fine, then a quarter of it.

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:37.074
Don't you know investment managers get paid a commission?

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:39.974
Cut the nonsense and get out now.

00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:43.244
Your son is desperately trying to kill those news stories.

00:11:43.474 --> 00:11:45.684
What if I give another interview?

00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:49.054
Should I tell them an arsonist's shameless family...

00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:51.354
is demanding money from the victims?

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:55.654
Darn it. This is why cash is king.

00:11:55.994 --> 00:11:57.594
To think she was once so quiet...

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:01.434
is now daring to run her mouth off at me.

00:12:01.494 --> 00:12:03.694
You're one to talk about "daring."

00:12:03.794 --> 00:12:06.804
That's not for you to say, after daring to go after my brother.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:10.574
You're the one who belongs in a mental hospital, Noh Sook Ja.

00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:12.844
That's it. I've had enough of you.

00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:14.274
Had enough of what?

00:12:15.614 --> 00:12:17.514
Get out! Get lost!

00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:19.084
Darn it.

00:12:20.584 --> 00:12:22.084
- Goodness... - Get out!

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:24.384
My gosh! My bag!

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.394
Gosh.

00:12:28.424 --> 00:12:32.394
Darn that ignorant brute. She's all brawn and no brains!

00:12:32.624 --> 00:12:33.624
Darn it.

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:37.734
I want to see my princess.

00:12:38.264 --> 00:12:40.264
But my princess says she doesn't want to.

00:12:41.034 --> 00:12:43.204
But I still want to see her.

00:12:48.014 --> 00:12:50.574
You little brat! Give that to me right now!

00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:53.084
Must I smash this to keep you away?

00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:54.784
Give me that knife!

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:55.854
- No! - Give it to me.

00:12:55.914 --> 00:12:57.554
I won't give it to you, Mom. You're a wicked witch.

00:12:57.624 --> 00:12:59.084
I'm not giving it to a villain!

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:01.024
Get back here!

00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:09.094
Noh Sook Ja is a horrible woman. Why did she come here again?

00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:12.664
It looks like she came by to spout more of her nonsense.

00:13:13.264 --> 00:13:15.034
Mr. Do, you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:19.344
Let me get you an iced coffee. Please, come in.

00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:21.774
(YL Planning and Design Team)

00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:24.514
You've been through a lot lately, haven't you?

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:27.144
It's been quite the spectacle.

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:30.654
This is a year I'll never forget.

00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:34.724
My birth secret, finding out who my parents are...

00:13:35.454 --> 00:13:40.024
Like you said, it's gotten easier with time.

00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:44.764
But seeing our mom sick has been tough.

00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:51.444
I'm still getting used to it. Don't worry.

00:13:51.504 --> 00:13:53.144
I'll get through this, just like everything else.

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:59.184
I never knew my little brother was such a strong man.

00:14:10.654 --> 00:14:11.664
Kang Jae In.

00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:14.234
And here I thought you'd gotten smarter,

00:14:14.264 --> 00:14:16.434
but you're still the same idiot.

00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:19.564
Did you really think I'd just leave the emails on this laptop?

00:14:23.504 --> 00:14:26.374
Jae In, what's on the laptop? What were you looking for?

00:14:29.214 --> 00:14:32.014
Here, take it. Check it all you want.

00:14:32.214 --> 00:14:34.784
Instead of trying to steal it like the thieving tramp you are.

00:14:34.854 --> 00:14:37.214
Who are you calling a tramp? Look who's talking.

00:14:37.354 --> 00:14:39.854
Seung Woo. Just ignore her.

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.654
You really don't want to cross me.

00:14:42.854 --> 00:14:45.424
What now? Is that a threat?

00:14:46.294 --> 00:14:47.364
It is.

00:14:47.994 --> 00:14:50.234
Hwang Ji Ho.

00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.704
Just as I suspected.

00:14:56.734 --> 00:14:59.344
Does Hwang Gi Chan know that he isn't his biological son?

00:15:01.544 --> 00:15:05.014
Don't be ridiculous! Do you think he'd believe you?

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:08.754
Who knows? Maybe he will, maybe he won't.

00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:11.424
- Want to find out? - We're at work.

00:15:11.884 --> 00:15:13.854
Let's just drop it.

00:15:15.524 --> 00:15:17.624
Fine. Let's stop.

00:15:18.394 --> 00:15:22.494
CEO Catherine, I'll find that double contract,

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:24.664
so you'd better watch your back.

00:15:33.044 --> 00:15:34.914
Aren't you supposed to be working?

00:15:36.014 --> 00:15:38.114
Stop slacking off and do your job properly.

00:15:41.714 --> 00:15:45.154
You heard her, right? So just do your job properly.

00:15:54.994 --> 00:15:56.494
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:15:57.234 --> 00:16:01.934
This quarter's operating profit will likely be in the red.

00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:06.574
We have a lot of new projects, don't we?

00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:09.014
It's too early to discuss their performance.

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:12.784
We can aim for more operating profit in the fourth quarter.

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:18.324
However, the bank loans you received to fund new business ventures...

00:16:18.324 --> 00:16:19.754
are in urgent need of repayment.

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:23.494
Can't we just request an extension from the bank?

00:16:24.764 --> 00:16:25.764
Well...

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:28.864
The bank denied the request.

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:31.064
Due to rumours both inside and out,

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:34.304
the banking community's view of your creditworthiness...

00:16:34.974 --> 00:16:36.604
is not exactly favourable.

00:16:39.574 --> 00:16:41.274
What about Director Kang Mi Ran's faction?

00:16:41.814 --> 00:16:44.144
She's been covertly meeting with the board of directors.

00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:46.744
Primarily, the neutral members of the board.

00:16:47.314 --> 00:16:51.724
However, if your personal and company debts are not resolved,

00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:55.894
even our allies on the board will likely be forced to side with them.

00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:08.674
Have some tea.

00:17:11.104 --> 00:17:13.174
I wanted to talk to you somewhere more private.

00:17:13.404 --> 00:17:15.274
Maybe we could step out for a bit now?

00:17:17.674 --> 00:17:20.484
What I did to you was wrong,

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.354
and I want to apologise again. I'm so sorry.

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:26.824
You may not know this,

00:17:27.384 --> 00:17:30.424
but before I moved in with Gi Chan here in Korea,

00:17:31.054 --> 00:17:33.394
I struggled to raise Ji Ho all by myself in the United States.

00:17:34.394 --> 00:17:37.264
That's why when it comes to Ji Ho, I guess I get a bit oversensitive.

00:17:41.004 --> 00:17:42.734
As you can probably tell,

00:17:43.074 --> 00:17:45.644
it's not like I'm treated like a queen in this house,

00:17:46.074 --> 00:17:47.574
or that I'm living in the lap of luxury.

00:17:48.144 --> 00:17:50.174
My position in this house is precarious.

00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:52.914
But if they also find out Ji Ho's secret...

00:17:54.584 --> 00:17:56.614
Please, just give me a little more time.

00:17:57.314 --> 00:18:00.154
I'll talk to Gi Chan. I'll try to persuade him.

00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:06.564
I've heard just about enough.

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:08.734
How can you be so shameless?

00:18:10.334 --> 00:18:11.634
Then and now,

00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:13.464
Kang Se Ri,

00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:16.004
it's always been all about you.

00:18:17.104 --> 00:18:18.374
It's disgusting,

00:18:18.974 --> 00:18:20.804
so don't you dare pretend you're worried about Ji Ho.

00:18:21.144 --> 00:18:23.044
Teo, please. I'm begging you.

00:18:23.444 --> 00:18:25.584
I swear, this is going to kill me.

00:18:26.714 --> 00:18:27.714
Then go ahead and die.

00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:32.184
Gi Chan! Hey, Gi Chan!

00:18:32.384 --> 00:18:33.754
Can you look at my drawing?

00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:35.954
Not now, Gi Man.

00:18:45.004 --> 00:18:46.364
Honey, you're home early.

00:18:46.904 --> 00:18:48.034
What about dinner?

00:18:48.304 --> 00:18:49.434
I'm not hungry.

00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:52.204
Don't come in. I'm going to get some rest.

00:19:07.384 --> 00:19:09.024
I want to be alone.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.524
I drew this. It's good, right?

00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:15.294
I have another one.

00:19:18.634 --> 00:19:19.634
I drew it!

00:19:22.004 --> 00:19:23.074
And another one.

00:19:24.774 --> 00:19:26.544
"Stay strong, Dad."

00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:31.444
That's strange.

00:19:31.784 --> 00:19:33.244
But Dad passed away.

00:19:34.014 --> 00:19:35.354
I'll go ask Mom.

00:19:45.094 --> 00:19:47.224
(Hwang Eun Ho)

00:19:49.394 --> 00:19:51.364
Looks like some of Eun Ho's stuff was still lying around.

00:19:59.244 --> 00:20:01.614
(Stay strong, Dad! I love you, Mom and Dad!)

00:20:01.674 --> 00:20:03.214
Stay strong, Dad.

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:05.444
I love you, Mom and Dad.

00:20:05.744 --> 00:20:06.814
Love, Eun Ho.

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:14.994
I guess Eun Ho could tell you've been struggling lately.

00:20:15.624 --> 00:20:17.494
He's grown into such a thoughtful boy, hasn't he?

00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:20.124
I'm rooting for you, too.

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:23.164
Stay strong, honey.

00:20:23.694 --> 00:20:27.704
You always have me and Eun Ho with you.

00:20:28.204 --> 00:20:29.204
Don't forget that.

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:30.904
I love you.

00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:35.644
(Stay strong, Dad!)

00:20:46.924 --> 00:20:47.924
Fire!

00:20:48.654 --> 00:20:49.724
It wasn't me.

00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:51.094
It wasn't me!

00:20:56.994 --> 00:20:58.734
It must be that woman from the chicken shop today.

00:20:59.204 --> 00:21:00.664
I bet that's why I'm so rattled.

00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:05.444
Why on earth would her husband be in my dream?

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:08.944
I'd almost completely forgotten what he looked like.

00:21:12.584 --> 00:21:13.844
The fire was just blazing.

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:19.884
I can't sleep like this. I need a drink.

00:21:35.804 --> 00:21:36.804
Darn it.

00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:39.404
What did I do that was so wrong? What?

00:21:40.544 --> 00:21:41.944
If they were in my shoes,

00:21:42.374 --> 00:21:43.814
do you think they wouldn't have done the same?

00:21:45.714 --> 00:21:49.014
I lost my husband and was saddled with three kids,

00:21:49.714 --> 00:21:51.424
what choice did I have? We had to eat.

00:21:53.154 --> 00:21:56.024
What am I supposed to do if my mind is just sharp that way?

00:21:56.694 --> 00:21:59.094
She should've looked after her own husband.

00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:17.014
(Stay strong, Dad! I love you, Mom and Dad!)

00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.484
Honey.

00:22:21.654 --> 00:22:22.654
Jae In...

00:22:45.474 --> 00:22:46.544
You're still up?

00:22:50.374 --> 00:22:51.514
Have you been drinking?

00:22:53.184 --> 00:22:55.554
I had a terrible nightmare, so I had a little drink.

00:22:56.314 --> 00:22:57.354
Unbelievable.

00:22:57.914 --> 00:23:02.454
The chicken place woman's husband appears in my dream and keeps me up.

00:23:04.724 --> 00:23:05.924
My six million dollars.

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:09.294
A bunch of rotten scoundrels.

00:23:09.894 --> 00:23:12.704
How can they be so shameless after gobbling up someone else's money?

00:23:13.364 --> 00:23:14.704
They'll get what's coming to them.

00:23:15.574 --> 00:23:16.574
That's enough.

00:23:17.774 --> 00:23:19.974
How are we any different from them?

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:22.344
We're different.

00:23:22.674 --> 00:23:23.674
Of course, we're different.

00:23:24.244 --> 00:23:26.114
It was just some insurance money.

00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:28.414
How could that ever compare to my six million dollars?

00:23:29.254 --> 00:23:30.814
Were you ever happy...

00:23:31.354 --> 00:23:33.084
with the money you earned that way?

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:34.624
What's there to be unhappy about?

00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:38.294
If they'd gotten the insurance money,

00:23:38.294 --> 00:23:40.764
they'd have just wasted it by now.

00:23:41.494 --> 00:23:43.694
I have a good eye and a nose for investing.

00:23:43.694 --> 00:23:45.104
That's how it grew this much.

00:23:45.464 --> 00:23:46.464
Is that a crime?

00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:50.234
I feel miserable right now.

00:23:52.374 --> 00:23:54.374
I fought tooth and nail to take over YL Group,

00:23:55.474 --> 00:23:56.774
and I have everything I ever wanted.

00:24:00.214 --> 00:24:02.314
I thought money was everything in life.

00:24:03.714 --> 00:24:05.654
Just like you said, I thought it was happiness.

00:24:07.884 --> 00:24:08.894
But I was wrong.

00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:11.724
I'm not happy at all.

00:24:13.124 --> 00:24:15.694
- I feel so empty. - Don't give me that nonsense.

00:24:16.194 --> 00:24:18.704
You only think such useless things because you're swimming in money.

00:24:19.034 --> 00:24:20.434
Try having no money for a change.

00:24:22.034 --> 00:24:23.704
Every single day is torment.

00:24:24.304 --> 00:24:25.704
I feel empty.

00:24:26.344 --> 00:24:28.574
I don't see any reason to go on living like this!

00:24:29.144 --> 00:24:32.584
The only reason you feel unhappy now is because you got swindled,

00:24:32.944 --> 00:24:36.384
and you're just stressed because you're a little tight on cash.

00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:39.654
Gi Chan. Once money starts rolling in again,

00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:41.354
your misery will end, and you'll be happy again.

00:24:41.824 --> 00:24:43.954
Mother, please! Enough about money!

00:24:44.694 --> 00:24:46.394
Can you please just stop talking about money?

00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:49.934
Have you heard a single word I've said?

00:24:51.494 --> 00:24:53.964
I'm telling you I'm struggling and that I'm miserable,

00:24:54.304 --> 00:24:56.934
so you should be comforting me. How can all you talk about be money?

00:24:57.534 --> 00:25:00.004
Listen to him. Gosh, you're impossible.

00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:01.814
What did I just say?

00:25:02.014 --> 00:25:05.414
I told you money solves everything. Money!

00:25:05.644 --> 00:25:07.484
Money is the be-all and end-all.

00:25:07.484 --> 00:25:10.854
How is it that for you, everything boils down to money?

00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:14.284
Happiness, love, success, relationships...

00:25:14.354 --> 00:25:16.024
It's all about money!

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:20.564
It's that twisted way of thinking that ruined me, Mother.

00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:23.234
That's why I lost Jae In!

00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:26.504
- Shut up! - I was busy scrambling for more...

00:25:27.204 --> 00:25:29.634
and I ended up losing everyone I held dear.

00:25:30.704 --> 00:25:32.144
This is all your fault.

00:25:32.604 --> 00:25:34.044
If it weren't for you,

00:25:34.644 --> 00:25:36.074
I wouldn't be this miserable!

00:25:40.614 --> 00:25:42.854
Darn it. Get your story straight.

00:25:43.284 --> 00:25:45.784
Who lost his head over some girl and ruined this family?

00:25:46.084 --> 00:25:47.084
It was you!

00:25:48.654 --> 00:25:51.724
If you'd believed me when I said she was faking her amnesia,

00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:53.164
you wouldn't have been made a fool of.

00:25:53.824 --> 00:25:55.934
If money means nothing to you,

00:25:56.264 --> 00:25:57.794
then pay me back for raising you.

00:25:58.194 --> 00:26:00.464
I was cheated out of six million dollars,

00:26:00.464 --> 00:26:02.174
so you can give me my money back!

00:26:08.314 --> 00:26:09.374
You lunatic.

00:26:23.294 --> 00:26:26.494
(YL group)

00:26:31.334 --> 00:26:33.704
So, this is the price range you're asking for per piece.

00:26:35.834 --> 00:26:38.274
I'll keep this in mind when I negotiate the deal.

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:41.844
We discussed this last time.

00:26:42.114 --> 00:26:43.774
What's the status on meeting with the artist?

00:26:44.844 --> 00:26:47.684
Shouldn't I be discussing that with Director Noh Sook Ja?

00:26:48.514 --> 00:26:51.384
My mother has a lot on her plate right now.

00:26:52.284 --> 00:26:55.054
Regarding the paintings, you can see me or talk to her.

00:26:55.894 --> 00:26:57.324
That's why she's here with us today.

00:26:57.594 --> 00:26:59.594
You just focus on YL Group.

00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:02.564
I'll handle the discussions about the paintings with Teo.

00:27:03.564 --> 00:27:04.894
Alright, that works for me.

00:27:06.564 --> 00:27:09.304
Right, there's a favour I'd like to ask.

00:27:10.104 --> 00:27:11.774
Since you're the chairman of YL Group,

00:27:12.104 --> 00:27:14.274
it should be easy for you to find someone in Korea, right?

00:27:16.544 --> 00:27:17.944
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

00:27:18.914 --> 00:27:20.284
Who are you looking for?

00:27:21.214 --> 00:27:22.454
Actually, I have a younger sister...

00:27:22.454 --> 00:27:23.614
whom I was separated from a long time ago.

00:27:24.554 --> 00:27:26.624
I heard that she was now in Korea.

00:27:29.754 --> 00:27:31.554
What's your sister's name?

00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:33.694
Catherine.

00:27:34.924 --> 00:27:35.994
Catherine?

00:27:40.504 --> 00:27:41.604
What a coincidence.

00:27:42.604 --> 00:27:45.244
I know someone with the same name.

00:27:46.004 --> 00:27:47.004
Catherine.

00:27:48.644 --> 00:27:49.644
Really?

00:27:50.374 --> 00:27:51.884
It's possible she's my sister.

00:27:52.844 --> 00:27:54.184
Would it be possible for me to meet her?

00:27:55.814 --> 00:27:57.214
I don't think she's your sister.

00:27:59.224 --> 00:28:02.054
Catherine is her American name.

00:28:02.754 --> 00:28:04.254
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:07.294
Oh, so you're Catherine.

00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:08.894
That's your American name?

00:28:10.764 --> 00:28:13.034
I'll see what I can do about finding your sister.

00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:15.934
No, that's alright.

00:28:15.934 --> 00:28:17.804
She's my sister, so I should be the one to find her.

00:28:19.044 --> 00:28:21.504
Well, it seems we're done here. I'll be on my way.

00:28:21.844 --> 00:28:25.584
Oh, would you like to have dinner with us later?

00:28:26.414 --> 00:28:28.654
We're staying in the same house, but we've barely seen each other.

00:28:29.154 --> 00:28:31.054
I feel bad that I haven't been a better host.

00:28:32.084 --> 00:28:33.154
I have plans.

00:28:33.824 --> 00:28:36.194
The people from DH Holdings invited me to a company dinner.

00:28:36.754 --> 00:28:39.094
They want me to experience a real Korean company dinner.

00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:42.234
I hear Korean chicken barbecue is famous.

00:28:43.234 --> 00:28:44.434
Please, don't mind me.

00:28:45.164 --> 00:28:47.934
You two have a wonderful evening.

00:28:57.644 --> 00:29:01.544
Oh, sit back down. You're our guest, so don't help.

00:29:02.654 --> 00:29:04.054
Enjoy the food.

00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:05.454
- Let me know if you need more. - Okay.

00:29:05.654 --> 00:29:06.684
- Thank you! - Thank you.

00:29:06.754 --> 00:29:07.754
Thanks, Mom!

00:29:09.054 --> 00:29:10.294
- Enjoy. - I will.

00:29:10.894 --> 00:29:11.894
I'm here.

00:29:12.664 --> 00:29:13.664
Hey, you're here. Come on in.

00:29:15.664 --> 00:29:16.664
Hello.

00:29:17.064 --> 00:29:19.504
Hey, glad you could make it. Have a seat.

00:29:20.004 --> 00:29:21.134
Please, don't be so formal.

00:29:22.304 --> 00:29:24.604
All right, then. Sit down.

00:29:28.514 --> 00:29:31.814
Gosh! Let's dig in. I'm really looking forward to this.

00:29:33.184 --> 00:29:34.844
- Please, help yourself. - Right.

00:29:34.914 --> 00:29:36.114
- Eat up. - Okay.

00:29:36.184 --> 00:29:37.184
Yes.

00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:40.054
- Here, go ahead and have some. - Thank you.

00:29:47.694 --> 00:29:48.764
I have plans.

00:29:49.464 --> 00:29:51.964
The people from DH Holdings invited me to a company dinner.

00:30:07.384 --> 00:30:08.584
Are you okay? Is it too spicy for you?

00:30:08.954 --> 00:30:10.154
That's when you have a drink.

00:30:12.184 --> 00:30:13.284
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:30:16.054 --> 00:30:17.954
- It's delicious, isn't it? - It's so good.

00:30:20.324 --> 00:30:22.064
You had Jae In right by your side,

00:30:22.464 --> 00:30:24.234
the most precious person in the world,

00:30:25.094 --> 00:30:27.234
and you're the one who threw it all away.

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:30.034
So don't come around now acting like you're somebody.

00:30:31.604 --> 00:30:32.974
It's pathetic.

00:30:33.404 --> 00:30:34.744
You catch on quick.

00:30:35.444 --> 00:30:38.374
Jae In is a very charming woman.

00:30:39.044 --> 00:30:40.344
Of course, I'm interested.

00:30:40.784 --> 00:30:42.484
I'm interested in her.

00:30:55.894 --> 00:30:56.934
I know, right?

00:31:01.634 --> 00:31:02.904
Come here. We need to talk.

00:31:05.444 --> 00:31:06.504
I have nothing to say to you.

00:31:09.044 --> 00:31:10.944
I thought your project with Designer L was finished,

00:31:11.444 --> 00:31:13.014
so we have nothing else to talk about.

00:31:15.354 --> 00:31:17.314
Let's save work-related matters for tomorrow.

00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:27.994
That's enough.

00:32:15.544 --> 00:32:19.514
(Queen's House)

00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:23.284
I said I wouldn't get involved if you two met, and I won't.

00:32:23.954 --> 00:32:25.454
But at least have some class.

00:32:25.854 --> 00:32:27.324
Are you proud of cheating?

00:32:27.954 --> 00:32:29.654
If you're going to see her, do it in secret.

00:32:30.724 --> 00:32:31.854
What do you think of Jae In?

00:32:32.294 --> 00:32:33.994
You two just look so good together.

00:32:34.524 --> 00:32:36.264
He says we look great together.

00:32:36.494 --> 00:32:38.864
You'll have to excuse him. He's crazy about his older sister.

00:32:39.134 --> 00:32:40.764
Well, I'm a fool for you too, you know.

00:32:41.804 --> 00:32:43.004
I guess I was jealous.

00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:46.704
I heard from Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

00:32:47.774 --> 00:32:49.174
About your dinner plans with Teo.

00:32:50.314 --> 00:32:52.114
It's not like I have any right to object,

00:32:53.214 --> 00:32:54.614
but I liked you first.
