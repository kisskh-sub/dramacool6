00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.710
[Episode 27]

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.430
Hello?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.680
What?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.970
Could you speak louder?
I can't hear you clearly.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.760
Mr. Lu went to a meeting in the town.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.360
Tell me if you need anything.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.590
What?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.430
Manager Sun?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.870
Manager Sun escaped?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.000
What do you mean?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.400
Well, our...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.840
Our…

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.360
Our shipment

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.800
hasn't been paid yet.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.770
Who's going to take responsibility
for this?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.680
Please inform Mr. Lu

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.360
that due to this serious event,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.960
headquarters will send someone

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.360
to sort it out.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.240
All operations will be suspended
until the incident is solved.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.430
We have no choice.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.360
If you don't pay us,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.630
how can our company continue to operate?

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.590
And to purchase the raw materials
for these shirts,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.470
we're now in debt to the bank.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.530
Hello?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.150
Hello?

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.280
Mr. Lu.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.060
Are you with Jiuling now?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.680
Come back right away.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.010
Something's happened.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.130
Hurry up.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.120
Mr. Lu.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.610
Did you call the police?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.110
Yes.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.990
The police are looking for Manager Sun.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.590
He took all the money
in the company's account.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.220
How about contacting
that foreigner,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.400
the one who wants the goods?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.870
We can exchange the goods
with him directly.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.280
The foreigner transferred all the money

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.329
to Manager Sun.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910
But Manager Sun took the money
and ran away.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.079
That guy has lost confidence in this.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.110
How could he cooperate with us?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.370
What should we do then?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.960
How about

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.150
setting up a stall at Qipu Road?

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.190
You idiot.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.280
Qipu Road Market

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.430
is for young people.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.610
It's full of college students.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.700
I could cut some holes in jeans
and sell them.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.329
But what about business shirts?

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.730
Cut holes in shirts, too?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.210
You're really something.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.150
Why do we keep losing money
when doing business with you?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.480
Have you ever made any profit?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.230
Ye wanted

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.680
to tell me about it back then.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.560
But you stopped her.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.960
You said, "Ye, don't tell her."

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.280
If you told me, I would have stopped it.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.960
I told you to increase income
and reduce expenses.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.600
Did you follow my words?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.750
The factory is so big

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.320
with so many workers.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.670
We don't have any orders.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.200
How can those workers live?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.880
How can they support their families?

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.070
You're not a factory director anymore.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.190
Your company has to be responsible
for its own profits and losses.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.950
But you're still taking care of others.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.200
You can barely feed yourself in this way.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.810
Don't blame me for being harsh.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.070
We're relatives, and Ye isn't an outsider.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.240
Ye has always been behind you,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.310
cleaning up your mess.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.910
Alright, alright, Jiuling.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.780
This incident has happened.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.480
Getting anxious and upset won't help.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.010
It won't solve the problem.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.750
We should be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
more optimistic.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.490
Let's think of a solution now.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.050
Right.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.020
Ye is right.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.280
I have many friends I know well.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.670
I'll find them

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.970
and see if there are sales channels.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.630
I'll leave the company to you.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.280
What are you going to do?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.140
I'm going to find sales channels.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.810
Hey, Beichuan.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.880
Recently,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.950
I've read some of your articles.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.040
You've improved,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.620
especially in characterization.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.750
It's very good.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.550
Characters grow
from real-life experiences.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.480
It seems

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.480
everything

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.770
needs to be considered dialectically.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.480
This change for you

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.560
is a blessing in disguise.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.790
Mr. Zhong.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.540
I just scored

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.240
a lucky hit.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.130
What's more, Beichuan,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.320
I agree with your idea

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.800
of taking students

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.130
to meet all kinds of people
in the society.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.070
Only in this way,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.240
can they create more profound characters

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.040
when they return to class.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.030
Thank you for your approval.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.310
I believe creative work requires
immersion in life

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.310
and observation.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.540
Guo.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.730
What do you think

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.430
of Beichuan's idea?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.450
Mr. Zhong.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.870
I think it's an excellent idea.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.970
Beichuan is smart

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.270
and always ahead of us.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.510
He often comes up with

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.040
teaching methods that can
benefit students.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.750
Perhaps you should also

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.360
take your students

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.720
to observe the outside world.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.160
Yes.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.150
Yes.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.240
I absolutely will.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.040
Good.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.510
Jiuling.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.290
Are we really going to sell the goods
to Yu Dacheng?

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.090
Yes.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.040
Didn't you just discuss it
with him on the phone?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.070
The price he offered is acceptable.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.270
The price is okay.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.250
But I'm afraid the dealer
is not reliable.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.160
But we don't have any other options
right now.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Just give it a try.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.360
Yu Dacheng is not bad.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.810
At this critical moment,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.670
he's willing to offer this price.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.360
We should not care about
who he sells the goods to.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.490
He's paying in cash.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.659
We can't afford to lose money.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.510
Okay.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.890
Let's give it a try.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.780
Everybody,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.360
from today,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.040
our class content

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.650
will undergo some changes.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.270
I will take you all

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.990
to the Qipu Road Clothing Market

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.470
for field research

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.580
and sketching.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.190
Everyone should not

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.830
just take a superficial look

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.970
but carefully observe

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.160
the characters you're going
to write about.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.920
One week later,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.150
I expect everyone
to submit your assignments.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.520
Any genre is acceptable,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.450
including essays, short stories, or poems.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.070
Professor Beichuan is really nice.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.680
Yeah.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.560
I like his classes too.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.390
And he will even take us to
the Qipu Road Market.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.640
Then whose class don't you like?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.140
Isn't it obvious?

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.870
Is it right to gossip about teachers?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.270
Hurry up and get to class.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.970
[36 Tactics]

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.130
This is the pink one.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.430
And there's a light blue one.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.600
Why are two pieces missing
from the light blue set?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.870
Did you put them in that box earlier?

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.360
Here they are.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.000
Bosses, food is here.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.550
Let's eat something first.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.390
Are they the same?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.030
Sis.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.290
Thank you. Thank you.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.900
These are all dishes she likes.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.410
These aren't dishes I like.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.620
Well, what should we do?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.480
Everyone dotes on their own wife.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.670
Come on.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.050
I'm just in the way.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.910
You guys eat first.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.250
Is there anything I can help with?

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.050
Why don't you seal that opening?

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.360
Okay?

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.690
No need to ask for my opinion.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.690
Beichuan.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.190
If everyone

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.190
at your school buys one,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.200
all our goods

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.600
would be sold out, right?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.360
Jiuling,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.090
don't get this nerd in trouble.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.240
Their school strictly forbids
this kind of behavior.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.150
If they label him with workplace safety
violations,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.080
he's doomed.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.539
Workplace safety?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.510
Come to work happy,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.970
and go home safe and sound.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.010
You meant campus business
activities, right?

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.680
Yes. I misspoke.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.240
It's okay.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.960
Jiuling, how about this?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.450
I'll go with you to set up the stall
this weekend.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.250
That won't work.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.930
See?

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.730
Aren't you busy writing your book?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.020
You have no spare time.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.880
Then how about this?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.020
I'll spend my own money

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.620
and buy a hundred or so items.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.900
You're still arguing.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.440
Beichuan.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.200
From now on,

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.770
you need to save money.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.410
You need to save up

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.030
for a car,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.790
appliances,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.360
and a wedding.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.270
No need.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.330
I'll buy my own car and all that stuff.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.360
So you mean

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.630
you want Beichuan to marry into
your family?

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.480
It's so easy to do so.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.000
It depends on my willingness

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.090
and how he behaves.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.960
Alright.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.700
Is there anything else I can do?

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.700
Go write your romance novel.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.790
You're just making a mess here.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.320
Then,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.590
you eat first.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.530
I'll go make some soup for you.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.260
Thank you, Beichuan.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.190
Beichuan is a nice guy
with a great personality.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.590
He listens to everything you say.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.270
That's because everything I say is right.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.530
Oh my god!

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.720
You're

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.000
so self-admiring.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.740
Treasure him.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:10.870
Jiuling,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.150
he should be the one treasuring me.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.750
I can't stand listening to this anymore.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.440
It's unbearable.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.270
What are you doing?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.790
Just eat your food.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.360
I'll eat too.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.290
You like this dish. Let's share it.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.690
I believe that your products

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.680
are of high quality.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.940
How about this?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.430
My buddies and I will take
this whole batch.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.750
Mr. Yu.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.030
You're truly a straightforward person.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.320
No, no. You don't have to be so polite.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.650
Just call me Yu Dacheng.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.150
Now let's talk about the price.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.480
Mr. Yu.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.580
Didn't we already agree on a price?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.000
Things have changed.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.660
Plans can't keep up with changes, right?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.750
Mr. Yu.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.440
In business,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.270
what matters most is credibility.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.960
We've already signed an agreement.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.360
How can you just change it?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.320
Let me tell you something.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.600
Don't try to fool me.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.480
When we were already in this business,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.080
you were nowhere to be found.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.580
Use Mr. Lu to threaten me?

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.740
Let him talk to me himself.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.950
Listen.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.700
Sell this batch of shirts

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.910
at half price,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.200
or let them collect dust
in your warehouse

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.410
and turn into garbage.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.670
Garbage? How dare you?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.590
If you can't sell them,
they're just garbage.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.400
I want to sell you at half price!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.200
Why are you shouting?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.440
Our products are hot sellers
in Eastern Europe.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.600
50% off? No way.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.820
How shameless you are!

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.660
Ask others that

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.740
who still deals with Old Lu these days?

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.880
Only we few still treasure
our old friendship

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.120
and want to help him.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.120
Hot sellers?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.030
Let me tell you.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.840
Anything that can't be sold is garbage.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.030
Dare you say it again?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.600
No, you...

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.440
Then don't buy it.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.550
Why are you still standing here? Get out!

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.910
Get out!

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.000
Hey, harridans,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.150
is this the way you do business?

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.150
Who are you calling harridans?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.630
You.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.600
Say it again.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.340
Harridans.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.270
What are you doing?

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.960
How dare you! Shameless!

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.510
How dare you hit me?

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.670
So many people are watching.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.440
I have three men backing me up.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.360
We have a whole workshop of men.
We are fearless.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.240
Guys!

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.720
Grab your tools and fight against them.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.600
Let's go!

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.130
Listen.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.840
Wait and see.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.100
I'll beat you to death!

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.650
What a way to run a business?

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.760
Get lost!

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.100
Shameless!

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:12.990
Mr. Zhong.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.190
If you and your wife like these products,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.330
please help promote them
among your friends and family.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Alright.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.950
Mr. Guo.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.530
I brought shirts for everyone
in the office.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.590
This one is for you.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Professor Xiang.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.950
Why are you giving everyone shirts?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.920
My partner's factory is having
difficulties lately.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.780
Their shirts are selling poorly.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.920
But don't worry.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.070
These are high-quality shirts.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.700
They were made for export
but now sold domestically.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.750
Sandwashed Silk.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.430
Mr. Zhong.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.540
Did you take some too?

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.540
I took two.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.080
Look.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.790
This whole box of shirts

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.200
will cost at least two months
of his salary.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.910
Someone who dates in this way

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.220
is rare these days.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.580
That's what I should do.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.740
Large and extra-large.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.500
I want extra-large.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.340
Okay.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.830
Professor Xiang.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.870
I saw some green ones in that box.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.530
Can I exchange for a green one?

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.600
Sure.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.460
Thank you.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.030
Mr. Guo.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.360
You said you wanted to change
to a green one.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.820
There are no more green ones
in extra-large.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.860
I think there are yellow ones
in extra-large.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.480
Well.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.030
Alright.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.720
Good-quality shirts on sale!

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.910
Check out our goods!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.340
Export quality! Premium merchandise!

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.680
Take a look, ladies!

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.660
Look, this is really good!

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.360
How long it will take

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.470
to sell them all?

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.550
Take a look!

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.630
Check out these shirts!

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.390
Have a look?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.830
Buy one for your wife!

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.010
Mr. Yan!

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.000
Mr. Yan, what brought you here?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.670
Mr. Yan.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.720
Come see our shirts. Come on.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.080
Take a look at our goods.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.610
Is this market merchandise? No.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.980
These are for export.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.080
These are all for export. Take a look.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.000
They're excellent. Come on.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.720
Come on.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.250
What happened to Lu Guoyao?

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.330
I've asked around.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.240
Manager Sun is a fraud.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.550
He swindled money from foreign investors

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.660
but he didn't give it to you.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.970
Now he's gone.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.940
I want some of these goods.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.670
Really, Mr. Yan?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:12.920
Oh my goodness.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.000
Well, now

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.240
I'll have all these goods loaded for you.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.710
You're a big help, Mr. Yan.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.640
I'm not stingy. I'll give you a discount.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.790
How about 1% off?

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.710
You're too shocked to speak, huh?

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.550
5% off.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.050
I'm just joking with you.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.340
How about this?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.710
I'll give you 20% off.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.350
Take half of the goods. Cash payment.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.410
No credit allowed.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.450
What are you doing?

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.950
-5% off. He didn’t say no.
-Okay.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.080
Draft the contract.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.200
Alright.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.080
Mr. Yan is helping us
with the 20% discount.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.830
We're in a difficult situation, right?

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.360
No.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.310
How could you

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.730
sell all the shirts out?

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.730
Don't worry.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.050
I never make deals that lose money.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.910
I have channels

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.520
to sell them to Eastern Europe.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.590
Look at Mr. Yan.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.990
He has connections in Eastern Europe.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.530
And then look at Mr. Lu.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.120
He ran away.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.360
He seemed like an honest person.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.630
But look what he did.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.000
He left two women here
to mind the store.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.700
It's so frustrating.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.680
Xining.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.260
My offer still stands.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.480
If you want,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.520
you can come work for me anytime.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.150
Mr. Yan.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.010
How much salary are you offering?

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.030
I promised

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.250
3,000 yuan per month

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.790
plus bonuses and commission.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.840
Deal!

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.670
Give us 6,000 yuan

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.950
and we'll both work for you.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.550
Don't make decisions for me.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.000
My priority right now

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.480
is to clean up this mess.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.270
Right.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.530
Clean up the mess.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.960
Once we clean up this mess,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.290
we'll come work for you.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.360
You said you have channels
in Eastern Europe.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.740
If I want to go to Eastern Europe,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.740
I need to get an invitation letter.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.630
How can I get it?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.980
Don't worry. I'll handle it for you.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.630
It must be expensive.
How much does it cost?

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.490
Not expensive.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.270
It's just a piece of paper. Not expensive.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.000
Oh my! Just a piece of paper?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.360
I know it.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.670
That piece of paper

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040
is worthy of 3,000

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.520
dollars.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.000
Just a piece of paper?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.030
That's easy for you to say.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.680
Jiuling,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.109
pack everything up

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.160
and deliver the package to my company.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.880
Then,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.960
I'll pay you in person.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.550
Alright.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.310
Okay.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.270
When would be a good time for me to come?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.000
If you make

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.200
me do it,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.790
I could deliver it tonight.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.859
But I think the best time would be

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.910
tomorrow morning.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.670
Why?

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.710
Because when I deliver
these goods tomorrow,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.550
we can start working in his company
right away.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.550
Hold on, Jiuling.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.470
Drink more water

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.470
and talk less.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.870
Xining, I'll be going now.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.330
I'll have her deliver the goods to you later.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.480
Bye, Mr. Yan.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.650
Be careful. The road is slippery.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.580
How many shirts are left?

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.840
What are you going to Eastern Europe for?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.710
To find Old Lu?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.110
Eastern Europe is huge.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.570
Where would I look for him?

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.480
Don't tell me

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.720
you're going to run away

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.200
just like him,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.480
and leave me here.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.840
Am I that kind of person?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.120
But there is one problem.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.590
This batch of shirts,

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.870
from raw materials to pattern making,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.760
is aimed at the high-end market.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.680
Mr. Yan is taking half of them.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.270
We can't just sit here,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.950
selling the rest
at a street stall every day.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.160
Got it.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.190
You want to sell goods to Eastern Europe.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.920
I'll try to

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.850
expand the international market.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.030
I've

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.590
noticed something.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.720
What's that?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.550
Does Mr. Yan

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.130
like you?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.550
Men like Mr. Yan

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.010
can like many women at the same time.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.640
Come on!

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.490
I don't think Mr. Yan likes me.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.200
Jiuling,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.570
drink more water

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.490
and talk less.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.350
Oh my!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.380
You two are really in sync now.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.580
Write an application

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.310
and I'll submit it for you.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.750
That's wonderful, Mr. Zhong.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.050
Our school is finally caring about

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.380
the housing issues for us young teachers.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.480
I,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.110
Beichuan,

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.000
and Professor Liu

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.760
have been working for so many years.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.160
We were worried we might not get a house

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.000
even by the time we retire.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.160
Now the problem is solved.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.480
We are going to live in the same building.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.420
It will be convenient for us to have
academic exchanges and discuss work,

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.420
right, Beichuan?

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.430
But you have to hurry up.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.400
These dormitory buildings
are in high demand.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.120
Not everyone can get a room.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.000
Then,

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.510
what is the housing allocation policy?

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.590
Is it based on seniority or

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.530
teaching performance?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.720
I don't know.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.240
It will be decided by school leadership.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.110
Anyway,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.880
act quickly.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.590
By the way, Beichuan,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.310
as for

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.920
our years of service,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.720
which of us has been here longer?

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.770
No need to think about it.
I remember it.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.030
I arrived one semester earlier than you.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.310
Good-quality shirts on sale!

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.110
Jiuling.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.050
What brought you here?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.120
I finished my class.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.160
I came over

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.790
to help you and Xining.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.680
Xining isn't here.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.510
She went out.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.310
Don't leave.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.830
You have no classes today, right?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.070
Help me call out to customers.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.000
I'm a bit tired.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.680
No problem.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.350
Okay.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.270
Come on!

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.160
How should I call out, Jiuling?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.440
Follow me.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.070
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.070
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.790
And then

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.700
you need to raise your voice at the end!

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.860
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.480
Okay.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.750
Yes.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.310
Then I can relax now.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.640
I'll have a rest.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.980
You take it easy first.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.730
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.310
Professor Xiang,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.320
why are you selling goods here?

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.050
I'm helping Miss Ye sell her products.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.110
This stall belongs to their factory.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.100
So Miss Ye is a street vendor.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.040
Well then,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.160
I'll help Miss Ye too.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.550
I'll take

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.920
ten of these shirts.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000
Tong Tong, don't mess around.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
You can't wear ten shirts anyway.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.430
I may not wear them all,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.040
but I can give them as gifts.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.000
Come on, boss.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.580
Give me ten of those shirts.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.550
How many?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.270
Ten.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.790
Oh my!

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.350
No, Jiuling.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.030
Don't get them for her.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.160
She's my student.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.400
What's wrong with that?
Students also wear clothes.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.260
Her family can wear these shirts,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:42.790
right?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.030
Your dad and mom,

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:44.750
grandpa and grandma,

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.880
and the whole family can dress
in matching outfits

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.350
and going on a spring outing.
How nice would that look!

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.750
Right?

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.810
-I’ll pack the shirts for you.
-Yeah.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.980
These shirts would look great on you.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.640
Sweetie,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.590
look.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.000
Look at my jeans.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.030
These are the latest style with rips.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.350
They're super trendy.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.640
Professor Xiang has 5 or 6 pairs.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.830
But he doesn't dare wear them to school.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.270
Look.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.240
Do you like it?

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.550
Alright then.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.480
I'll help Miss Ye a bit more.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.000
I'll take

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.400
five pairs of jeans.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.700
This girl knows what she wants!

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200
I'll pack them up for you.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.030
For these jeans,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.370
I'll charge you 85 per pair.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.060
Professor Xiang pays the same price.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.550
No need.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.420
I want to pay the original price.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.680
Sweetie, the original price is 110 yuan.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.730
Then I'll pay 110 yuan per pair.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.270
Thank you, dear.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.020
Wait, Tong Tong.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.550
Do you have that much money?

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.960
How much is it, boss?

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.730
1,050 yuan in total.
Just give me 1,000 yuan.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.590
Help pack them.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.350
What are you doing?
Stop staring at her.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.310
I'm counting them for you.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.720
One.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.550
Two.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:45.830
Three.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.960
Four.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.870
Wait a minute.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.520
Where did you get all this money?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.030
It's just some pocket money

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.960
from my family.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.080
All packed up for you.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.000
It's a bit heavy.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.350
Take these two in this hand,

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.880
and this in your other hand.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:01.890
Professor Xiang,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.480
I've bought so many products.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.030
Can you get off work now?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.430
This is none of your business.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.630
Go back to school now.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.280
Come back in a few days
when I get new styles in.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.750
I found something unusual.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.260
There is nothing special.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.980
She's just a student of mine.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.100
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.460
Professor Xiang, you truly live up
to your reputation.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.320
We've all

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.800
read your manuscript.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.790
Do you know how we felt

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.120
after reading it?

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.630
How did you feel?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.680
Your writing

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.120
is like a vast ocean.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.310
And we editors

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.550
are like small boats on that ocean.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.550
We're

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.100
planning to serialize it

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.430
and publish it as a book.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.150
Senior.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.250
Please stop teasing me.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.590
I'm serious.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.900
Your article is great.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.200
We're ready to publish it.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.350
Well, that's

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.750
good news for me.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.790
And I've just

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.350
gathered some new materials recently.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.310
I'll add them in later.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.030
Okay.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.430
Is there a student in your department

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.300
named Tong Tong?

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.080
Yes.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.000
She came to see me a few days ago.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.920
She claimed to be very close to you.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.160
She wrote a manuscript

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.890
and insisted that I publish it.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.830
I couldn't refuse her.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.920
So, I glanced through it.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.380
But I couldn't get into it.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.110
It was all about trivial romances

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.400
and extremely explicit.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.070
You know

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.750
this kind of article isn't suitable
for our publication.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.310
So, I rejected her.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.920
You don't mind it, do you?

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.180
Of course I don't mind.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.020
Let me tell you.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.350
Tong Tong

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.550
is just one of

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.200
my ordinary students.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.590
I thought you two were really close.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.550
Not at all.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.720
Aren't you going to return that call?

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.880
Someone's looking for you.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.140
I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.160
I'll go return that call first.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.960
Go ahead.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.670
I won't be home for dinner today.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.820
Go out and get something to eat.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.920
Stop eating instant noodles.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.320
It's bad for your health.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.640
You're not coming back to eat?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.750
Where are you going?

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.150
I'm going to see Ms. Shan.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.070
Why are you seeing her again?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.310
I'm doing business.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.910
Of course I have to visit her.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:41.790
I'm done talking.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.850
I need to drive now.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.310
Ms. Shan.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.720
Ye,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.440
why are you here now?

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.310
Off work?

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.530
I'm not here for work.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.030
I have some personal matters
to discuss with you.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.880
Are you free tonight?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.270
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.070
Okay.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.550
Next time, don't park your car
at our office entrance.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.480
Got it, Ms. Shan.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.280
Let's go.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.010
Making noodles?

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.400
Have you seen Yin recently?

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.750
Didn't he go to America?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.160
I just received a postcard

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.220
sent by him from Canada a few days ago.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.790
He never made it to America.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.310
He was stopped at the Canadian border.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.350
He said

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.880
he would settle scores with me
after he came back.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.480
Tell him to try messing with me.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.610
That's ridiculous.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.720
If he really comes back to confront you,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.790
you should return his money.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.590
Why should I give him a refund?

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.980
How about this?

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.380
If you two run into each other,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.830
just tell him

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.440
to save up more money.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.420
This year I'll guarantee
he gets to America.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.750
If I run into him,

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.720
I'll advise him to give up on this idea.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.440
Do whatever you want.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.380
One less client won't hurt me.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.700
I'm going out for a bit.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.490
Close the door when you leave.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.200
Wait, aren't you going to
turn off the power?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.240
Turn it off for me.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.350
Ms. Shan,

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.270
is it okay for you to have dinner with me?

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.790
I hope I didn't interfere with you
picking up your child from school.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.400
My son lives with his grandmother.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.880
Her place is close to the school.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.410
It's convenient
for drop-offs and pick-ups.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.560
Are you curious about my child's father?

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.440
No.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.930
Ms. Shan, I am not...

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.330
I'm not that nosy.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.390
We live in different cities.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.350
He's in Beijing,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.610
and I'm in Shanghai.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.240
Just give me your ID card,
household registration book,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.920
and all the visa-related documents.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.070
That's all I need.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.720
Thank you for helping me.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.720
Which country are you going to again?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.510
Hungary.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.510
Ms. Shan,

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.310
this is for your services.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.680
No need.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.880
I can't let you help me for free.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.400
I said no, and I mean it.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.920
Ms. Shan, please take this money.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.450
If you keep insisting,
I won't help you at all.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.520
This is so embarrassing.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.860
You're starting a company.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.950
Consider this my investment in you.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.350
When you make it big,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.130
don't forget about my help.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.960
Ms. Shan,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.960
I'll work really hard

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.690
and won't let you down.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.550
Cheers to you.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.330
Wish you great success.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160
I'll drink first,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.260
no pressure on you.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.960
Xu.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.240
Beichuan.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.480
You're finally here.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.000
What's going on?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.550
Sit down.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.320
I've been waiting for ages.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.030
What's so urgent?

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.310
Listen to me.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.290
Do you remember

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.240
you gave me those two shirts?

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.310
When I tried them on,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.020
I found that the fabric, and the texture,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.500
were amazing.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.310
Even in this heat,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.110
when I wore them,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.110
they didn't stick to my skin
or feel stuffy.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.570
They're incredibly cool.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.750
I didn't even want to take them
off before going to bed.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.790
My wife said

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.160
they're obviously real silk.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.790
Yes,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.920
they certainly are.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.000
Mr. Guo,

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.550
you called me here so urgently

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.680
just for this?

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.750
No,

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.550
but it's related.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.920
Today, the supervisor from

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.120
the girls' dormitory

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.640
came to find me.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.530
She brought two shirts

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.750
identical to the ones you gave me.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.470
Exactly the same.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720
When I looked at them,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.780
I found the fabric,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.000
and the brand

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.480
were all identical.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.750
What's going on?

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.160
They complained to me

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.680
that someone in the girls' dormitory

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.030
sold

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.890
and peddled

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.500
this kind of shirt.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.470
The shirts are selling well.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.270
How much did you pay for these shirts?

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.070
35 yuan.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.690
They're selling them
with a price of 200 yuan now.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.660
The shirts are of high quality.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.120
Indeed it is.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.110
So what exactly happened?

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.080
I conducted a thorough investigation.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.310
I also looked into the anonymous letter

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.480
but couldn't find anything.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.880
I've carefully investigated this matter.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.780
Tong Tong.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:20.590
Tong Tong

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:21.800
insisted

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.940
that she got the products

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.870
from you.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.380
She said she wanted to help
you sell your products.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.660
She said you are having a hard time,

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.230
teaching classes during the day,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.450
and setting up stalls

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.000
to sell shirts in your spare time.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.210
She was talking nonsense.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.840
Beichuan,

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.070
you know that

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.600
students selling commercial products

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.400
on campus

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.750
is a serious violation of school rules.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.680
And as a teacher,

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.750
you encouraged

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.880
and instigated her

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.400
to help you with sales.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.350
At the very least,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.230
this could ruin your teaching career.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.920
And in the worst case,

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.510
the police station might get involved.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.960
But don't worry.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.680
I've already covered this up for you.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.650
I spoke with the dorm supervisor.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.160
I said that Professor Xiang

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.510
is an outstanding young teacher,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.970
and we can't let such a small mistake

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.280
affect his future career.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.480
Right?

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.050
The dorm supervisor

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.270
and I were

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.400
very close when we were young.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.160
So

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.590
she has promised me

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.590
no one else would

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.880
know this issue.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.390
No one else?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.960
Who else knows this matter?

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.640
Well,

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.920
you, me,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.590
Tong Tong, and the dorm supervisor.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.790
There won't be a fifth person who knows.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.110
I understand. Go on.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.400
Let's stop here.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.830
Nobody else knows about this.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.290
We won't spread it around.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.670
I've also spoken with Tong Tong.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.440
So you can rest assured.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.890
This absolutely won't affect your career.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.490
Thank you, Xu.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.100
Don't say that.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.270
We've been working together
for so many years,

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:07.920
right?

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.640
It's nothing.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.040
Yes.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.380
There's one more thing.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.270
I went back and carefully checked

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.440
my teaching notes.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.960
Last time I told you my seniority

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
was one semester more than yours.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.940
I was wrong.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.490
It's one semester and three months

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.820
and two days.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.590
Did you burn yourself?

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.400
I'm fine.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.130
I heard your school
is allocating apartments.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.260
How big will they be?

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.640
Young teachers like me can only
get dormitory-style units.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.280
I used to think being a teacher
meant job security.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.980
Now it seems pretty boring.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.219
Not that great.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.989
And the competition is fierce.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.190
Getting one unit would be lucky enough.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880
Frogs in a well.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.690
What do you mean?

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.350
I wasn't talking about you.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.969
I meant you competitors for housing.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.370
They're narrow-minded.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.400
Indeed.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.150
Those of us,

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.840
in a way,

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.520
are like frogs in a well.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.230
Are you upset?

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.219
Not at all.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.540
Actually, being a frog in a well
isn't that bad.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.920
It's not as exhausting as businessmen.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.360
They're all running around like crazy.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.070
Besides, doing business

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.280
isn't something everyone can do.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.320
So,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.840
don't work too hard.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.920
What else can I do?

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.970
Who am I doing this for?

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.670
We can't live

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.380
in this shabby warehouse
and eating instant noodles forever.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.510
Even if you get that apartment,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.620
we'll have children someday,

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.230
and we need someone to take care of them.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.320
When your parents

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.510
or mine come to help,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.440
where will such a big family live?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.450
Will there be enough space?

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.040
Do you think

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.200
people will change?

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:46.770
Everyone changes.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.650
What about us?

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.950
We'll change too.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.720
But I think

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.880
we'll change for the better.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.320
Why aren't you keeping silent?

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.920
Are you suggesting
we'll change for the worse?

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.040
Xiang Beichuan.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.380
If I change one day,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.700
will you still love me?

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.500
Change into what?

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.890
Like Shan Huajing?

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.750
I won't love you.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.720
Like Yan Jun?

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.110
That would be even worse.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.180
Why do you have such an attitude?

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.440
You are irresponsible.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.190
You keep saying you love me.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.370
But I casually mention two names,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.570
and you say you can't love me in this way.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.670
How can I believe in your love for me?

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.880
How can I believe in your love?

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.210
I'll ask you one more time.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.840
If someday

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.250
I change,

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.890
will you still love me?

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.830
Yes.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.510
Really?

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.360
Really.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.740
Then hug me.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.110
Beichuan.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.230
Tell me.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.710
We won't change, will we?

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.000
Beichuan.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.840
Who are you?

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:40.950
Let me introduce you.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.760
This is my friend.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.050
His name is Yin.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.960
Yin.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.500
This is my girlfriend.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.960
Hello.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.510
You guys talk first.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.770
I'll go back to my room.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.420
Buddy,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.270
remember to knock next time.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.870
Why did you suddenly come?

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.540
Beichuan.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.150
Can you take me to find Yan Jun?

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.840
I can take you to see him.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.710
But you need to tell me

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.970
why you want to see him.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.510
I gave him all the money I earned

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.190
working as a laborer in Europe.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.050
He said he could get me to America.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.550
But this time I was stopped
as soon as I entered Canada.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.460
I've tried to visit him several times

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.820
since I came back, but I couldn't.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.080
Does he know you're back looking for him?

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.360
Yes.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.730
Jiuling.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.150
Mr. Yan, you busy man.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.990
I was indeed held up by something.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.940
Next time, no matter what time,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.740
I'll arrive an hour early, okay?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.240
Have you ordered food?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:51.780
Not yet.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:53.810
Waiter!

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.240
Two iced Americanos

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.710
and two small cakes.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.400
Hurry up!

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.660
What's wrong with you?

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.320
When your heart is occupied with someone,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.900
your brain stops working, huh?

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.160
You forgot I don't drink cold beverages?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.770
Sorry, sorry.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.280
Um,

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.880
please change those two iced Americanos

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.110
to hot ones.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.400
Forget it.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.920
I have a lot to do today.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.850
You can drink them yourself later.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.450
I'm just wondering

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.440
why you are so concerned
about Ye's matters.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.000
Don't you know she has a boyfriend?

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.670
He's your classmate too.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.120
What do you want to do?

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.580
Me?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.680
I won't put pressure on them,

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.950
and never even thought about it.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.480
But sometimes,

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.150
devotion

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.480
can be one-sided, right?

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.070
This isn't like you, Mr. Yan.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.510
In all the time I've known you,

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.280
you've never

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.080
treated any other girl this way.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.550
Humans

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.070
always have some moments

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.400
of sincerity.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.260
In our talk today,

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.320
I need to reassess the true Mr. Yan.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.110
You're mocking me.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:10.840
Well.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.660
I bought you a new pair of shoes.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:20.510
Take a look.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.120
Alright.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.710
The visa

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.550
will be ready in about 20 days.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.350
Sorry for the trouble.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.610
No need to be so polite.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.360
If you're busy with something,

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.480
I can wait a bit longer.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.250
I have a lot to deal with today.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.390
I'll take my leave.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.910
Thanks for your gift.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.510
I'm off.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.440
Let me know if you need anything.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.070
Beichuan.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.080
Do you know this type of dog?

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.320
Chihuahua.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.890
Is it expensive?

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.280
Why do you ask?

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:09.070
That girl I mentioned

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.440
likes this kind of dog.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.630
When I have money,

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.230
I want to buy one for her.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.050
You'll definitely make your wish
come true.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.260
Yan Jun.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.820
Why are you here?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.800
Mr. Yan.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.760
I gave you

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.280
all the money I earned
in Europe as a laborer.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.800
You said you could get me to America.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.920
But this time when I got to Canada,

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.590
they sent me back.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.110
I've tried to find you several times
since I got back,

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.510
but you refused to see me.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.360
I heard that since you came back,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.440
you've been threatening to deal with me.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.510
Did you say that?

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.710
I gave you all my money
but nothing got done.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.000
How are you going to solve it?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.670
I'm asking you that

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.470
did you threaten to deal with me?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.800
Get out.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.760
Yan Jun.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.690
Let's talk this through.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.840
Yin has his own difficulties, too.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.510
You...

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.120
You get out, too.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.190
Who allowed you to bring him here?

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.190
Hello.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.920
This is Yan Jun.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.250
I heard that stock has been
doing really well lately.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.710
So how much money is in my account now?

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.440
Okay. Great.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.790
I'll definitely show
my appreciation later.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.250
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.190
Yin.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.250
That's all for now.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.690
What are you doing, Yin?

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.760
No.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:12.730
No.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.000
What's he doing?

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.670
Why are you hitting yourself with a cup?

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:18.550
Mr. Yan.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:19.710
I…

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.490
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.710
I just want to go to America.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.950
Please help me.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.490
Wipe the blood with some tissue.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.750
Going to America isn't impossible.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280
Listen.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.830
The situation over there has changed.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.160
The money I gave them before
isn't enough.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.760
If you really want to go to America,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.090
you'll need to pay more.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.670
How much?

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.840
I'll check how much more is needed

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.710
and tell Beichuan. You tell him.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.360
Mr. Yan.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.070
I've already given you all my savings.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.710
If that's not enough,

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.880
I'll figure something out.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.280
I'll borrow from others.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.680
But I'm begging you.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.200
Please help me get to America. Please.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.110
No problem.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:16.110
Beichuan.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.070
I faint at the sight of blood.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.840
Take him to the hospital.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.590
-Let's go.
-And let the doctor check

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:21.550
whether you need stitches or something.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:22.480
Cover your head.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.960
This way.
