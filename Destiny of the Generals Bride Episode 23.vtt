=Destiny of the General's Bride=

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 23=

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.679
Be careful

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:46.759
and don't break...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
Why are you here, demoness?

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.960
I should be asking you that.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.920
How can they touch
General's belongings?

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.560
He's on death row,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.159
so he's no longer a general.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.719
And you.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.840
I thought

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.359
you loved each other in weal and woe.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.079
Now

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.920
you're here saving your own skin.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.719
General and I
have agreed to have a divorce.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.560
And it's the deadline.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
Here's the repudiation letter.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.280
Please pass it to him on my behalf.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.340
(Repudiation Letter)

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.400
Trying to cut ties with Xiao Yun

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.640
to get away with it?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.359
I won't let you get your way.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.040
Is he dead?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.280
Not yet.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.640
He's breathing his last.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.319
We've been waiting for you two.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.159
Wake him up with some water.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.159
Let him see how his former lover

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.319
has treated him.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.360
You're losing it, huh?

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.919
What my Ye had

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.080
was worse than these few whips
you've had!

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.879
When he

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.520
was doing that to Hua,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.639
he should've seen that coming.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.759
How loyal you are.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.319
It's a shame that your Hua

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.759
has run away.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.439
I knew it, you're still alive.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.039
You need not provoke me

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.919
with such a lowly trick.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.599
You don't believe it?

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.759
Then I'll show you

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.879
the repudiation letter she got you.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.960
"Xiao Yun, Grand General
of 30,000 Calvary in Jiangzhou,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.240
is to be executed for a grave offense.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.840
His wife, Qing Yan, weeps
as she bids farewell to him.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.759
A chill wind blows, tears hard to stop.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.319
Petals fall without a sound,
the heart already spent.

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.480
She hereby sets down
this letter of divorce,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.580
lest there be no proof hereafter.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.639
This written agreement
shall serve as evidence."

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.759
Qing Yan...

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.280
Qing Yan...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.160
Xiao Yun, what else do you have to say?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920
I've said

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.560
what I needed to say.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.720
Today's the third day.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.279
Execute him.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.839
Qing Yan.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.240
I fear I can't wait much longer.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.600
Hold on!

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.279
Her Highness...

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.439
Imperial Uncle,
please put the execution on hold.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.480
It's a death sentence,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.360
there's no way we're postponing it.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.759
Twenty years ago,

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.759
there was a concubine murder case
at Xiao Residence.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.519
General Xiao is the main witness
of that case,

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.350
so he needs to be there
to give his testimony.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.279
That's a crime of passion
among the common folk.

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.160
What does that have to do with me?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.959
Carry on with the execution.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.199
That woman was Mo Mei.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.759
Stop!

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.260
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.519
(Twenty years ago)
I'll treat Mo Mei

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.959
like how I treat my own wife.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.839
(Old General Xiao)
When your son is born,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.160
I'll treat him like my own.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.519
I won't let anyone bully them.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.439
The situation in court is complicated.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.759
I fear that me taking the wrong side

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120
will implicate Mo Mei.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.319
Therefore, no one must know

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.639
about my relationship with Mo Mei.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.360
I understand.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.360
Mo Mei is a woman I met while traveling.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.560
The child she carries is mine.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.800
It has nothing to do with Your Lordship.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.040
Honey, come and meet Mo Mei.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.160
From today on,

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.600
she is your little sister.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.660
(Madam Mo Mei)

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:55.467
(Heritage of Generations)

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.079
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.360
You'd better explain

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.240
what you just said.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
Your Lordship,
don't believe their nonsense!

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:23.639
They've been bewitched by that demoness!

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.319
As for this case,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.879
I already have an advocate.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.240
Please come in.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.720
Didn't...

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.560
Didn't you leave?

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.759
Grand Madam Xiao,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.560
you didn't truly think

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.360
I'd divorce General Xiao, did you?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.319
"A chill wind blows, tears hard to stop.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.319
Petals fall without a sound,
the heart already spent."

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.720
That was clearly my signal to him.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.639
That pendant...

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.840
Where did you get it?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.279
Your Lordship, it's a long story.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.840
Please

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.080
hear me out.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080
(Your Lordship used to)

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.039
(have a lover who was an ordinary folk.)

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.590
Your Lordship!

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:05.679
(Her name was Mo Mei.)

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.039
You're back.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.879
Have you thought of a name

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.240
for our child?

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:13.360
You'll know on the day he's born.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720
(But with the turmoil of the times,)

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.919
(you feared she might be implicated.)

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:23.279
(Thus, he entrusted her
to Old General Xiao)

00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:25.919
(and strictly ordered
her identity kept secret.)

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:28.840
(But then war suddenly broke out)

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.159
(and Old General Xiao died in battle.)

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.159
(And Mo Mei passed away from illness.)

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.639
But what you didn't know was

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.240
Mo Mei did not die of plague.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.639
She was killed by Grand Madam Xiao.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.120
You've got better

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.440
at making up stories.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.320
Then tell me.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.039
What proof do you have?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.879
Due to her jealousy,

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.120
ever since Mo Mei
entered the Xiao Residence,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.720
Grand Madam Xiao made things hard
for her and the child.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.159
She even told me to kill the young heir.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.519
But he was still so small.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.279
(I couldn't bring myself to do that.)

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.360
(Later,)

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.639
(Grand Madam Xiao
ordered me to kill Madam Mo Mei.)

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.320
She threatened me

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:30.279
to make my husband divorce me
if I refused to do that.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.559
Everything has been seen to.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.559
And Xiao Yun?

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:37.360
He lost his mother
and fell into a high fever.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.480
His days are numbered.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:40.240
Madam.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.600
The King of Xiling is here.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.919
He's asking to see Mo Mei.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.279
Who?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.399
Second Madam, Mo Mei.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.440
(Only then did Grand Madam Xiao realize)

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:53.240
(Mo Mei was Your Lordship's woman.)

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:58.879
We... We'll just say Mo Mei
passed away

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.320
from fatigue after childbirth
and longing for him.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:04.519
Then we return Xiao Yun to His Lordship.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:07.559
You fool! Xiao Yun has grown up.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.240
If he blurts out in His Lordship's presence

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.159
that we abused

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.840
and poisoned his mother,

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.559
would we get away with it?

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:15.440
Well...

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.000
Our only choice

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.639
is to tell His Lordship

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.200
that Ye is his child.

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:21.320
But...

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.360
But I don't think that's appropriate.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.159
Didn't you want a position

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.559
for your husband?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.240
Now's the chance.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.039
Will you take it or not?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.840
And so

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.200
she tricked Your Lordship

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.039
into acknowledging Xiao Ye as your son.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.240
Utter nonsense!

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:45.559
How can we trust

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:46.600
these woman and servant?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.990
Your Lordship, please exercise
your judgment!

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:50.679
This is the proof.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:54.559
This pendant was given
by General Xiao's mother.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.559
He has always worn it.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.919
It's an ordinary trinket.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.879
How can you prove it was Mo Mei's?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.279
On its own, this jade pendant

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.679
seems nothing special.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.559
But paired with Your Lordship's
plum blossom pendant,

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:13.120
it's clear this was the token of love
between you and Mo Mei.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.919
Madam Xiao.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.360
Is Qing Yan
