00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.546
See?

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.591
I told you
even Mr. Famous would fall for it.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.968
Now, let's start working on other painters
one by one.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.804
All right.
Let's wet our whistles to celebrate!

00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:55.765
You're talking like an old man.

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:56.682
What the heck?

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.101
Why do good beginnings always end badly?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.394
What the heck?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.111
-What?
-Wait.

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:10.237
What's going on?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.495
Over there. That's Mr. Famous!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.413
-It's Mr. Famous. Run.
-Mr. Famous is here?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.754
This way.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.179
Get down, James!

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.096
He's gone.

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.765
Is he gone now?

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:38.849
Mr. Kim…

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.892
What just happened?

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.268
Gosh, we almost got caught.

00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:42.728
He didn't see us, right?

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:44.563
-No.
-Right, I don't think he saw us.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.190
He didn't see us.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:47.733
He saw us!

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:49.443
He must have! He's calling me.

00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:51.028
-What the heck?
-Calm down.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.364
We don't know what's going on yet.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.740
You're an heir to a family empire.

00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:56.742
-I'm an heir to a family empire.
-Exactly.

00:01:57.243 --> 00:01:58.577
I'm the one with leverage.

00:01:58.661 --> 00:01:59.912
-I'm the dominant one.
-Answer it.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.372
MR. FAMOUS

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.332
Hello, Mr. Choi. This is Mr. Famous.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.333
Yes, what is it?

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.710
-Wasn't that rude?
-No, it's fine.

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:09.088
-No? Did I sound okay?
-You sounded so polite!

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.175
If you're available tomorrow,
could I come see you at your place?

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:14.635
No, you're not available.

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.595
-I have to answer him.
-Say you can't.

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.055
No, wait!

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.390
Well…

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.934
There's a place I often go to.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:22.893
Let's meet there.

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:24.812
See you tomorrow.
Please send me the address.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.939
We don't have a house! What do we do now?

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.607
What's he planning?

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:29.525
Perhaps…

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:31.402
No way.

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:33.070
Did he find out?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.000
EPISODE 4

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:53.883
Mr. Famous.

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:06.854
Do you know Kim Yong-bok?

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:11.817
Kim Yeon-bok...

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.611
Kim Yeon-bok…

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.823
Yeon-bok's the name
of a Chinese chef. Geez.

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:34.381
I asked if you knew a man
called Kim Yong-bok.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.677
I'm not sure who Kim Yong-bok is…

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:49.188
My apologies
for not telling you in advance.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.483
Why are you apologizing…

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.652
I'm sure you felt very uneasy

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.820
when I reported your painting.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.989
I had to verify something.

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.575
I apologize again
for not informing you beforehand.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:05.412
Honestly,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.415
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel uneasy.

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.877
This won't get you involved
with the police

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:13.462
or put you in any trouble.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.421
That's a relief.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.008
But how did you know it was a forgery?

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:20.469
Well, to keep it short,

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.972
just like how everyone
has their own unique handwriting,

00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:25.140
all painters have their own
unique brushstrokes.

00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:28.560
Even the art forgers
have habits they can't hide.

00:04:28.644 --> 00:04:30.521
You can never ignore experience.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:35.192
I have data on all the art forgers
and art conservators in Korea.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.986
I can see through all of them.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.905
Any ordinary appraiser would have
fallen for it. But I'm Mr. Famous!

00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:42.908
No one can fool me.

00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:44.535
What's your opinion on appraisers?

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.745
Being an appraiser is not an easy job!

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.749
The history of appraisers
will start with me.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.335
An appraiser doesn't only judge
if the artwork is real or not,

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.712
but also one's emotions…

00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.422
Geez, that was exhausting.

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.716
He's so damn talkative.

00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:04.304
We didn't think
he'd have data on art conservators.

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:05.889
Director of Gallery Fame

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:08.225
and seasoned art critic, Mr. Famous,

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.352
is drawing attention after revealing

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:12.396
that a recently sold Elcasso painting
was a forgery.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.315
And now, several other forgeries
he previously identified

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.276
are receiving attention again.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.945
Mr. Famous will only get more followers.

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.823
His clients will trust him even more.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.367
We underestimated him.

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.494
We were completely wrong.

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:28.912
That's kind of true.

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.122
Kind of.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:36.545
He needed a reputation
to make more money before the big event.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.547
And we fell for it.

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.383
Wait. By big event…

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.262
do you mean this?

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.559
"A charity auction party."

00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.811
He called to give you this.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:54.688
Yeah. He told me…

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:56.648
It's time to play in the big leagues now.

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:59.485
-Let me invite you to said big leagues.
-Right.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.945
Join us in the big leagues.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.198
"It's time to play
in the big leagues, Mr. Choi."

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.366
"Join us in the big leagues."

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.868
Then, he gave that to me.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.328
Yi-rang, are you listening?

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.913
Stop talking.

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:13.248
I'm going to get some sleep.
Don't wake me up.

00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:19.671
She must be shocked.

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:20.589
Right.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.842
We should give her some time, right?

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.844
I think so.

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:30.307
Yay, the fried chicken is here!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.601
Fried chicken that's to die for!

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:33.852
Sweet and salty!

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.230
And crispy on the outside
and juicy on the inside!

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:40.275
Today, I got some
with special garlic sauce,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.570
which will help boost your immune system.

00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:45.072
There's no time to sleep.

00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.992
Excessive drinking is bad for your liver.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.452
So let's drink a lot!

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:51.787
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:57.751
By the way, Yi-rang.

00:06:57.835 --> 00:07:00.629
It's about time
you come up with the next plan.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.298
Of course.
Yi-rang would never give up like this.

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:04.258
She would never.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.093
I bet she came up
with an even more wicked plan.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.010
For sure.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.221
We'll find Mr. Famous's list.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.764
Mr. Famous's list?

00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:13.267
The artwork ledger
that Mr. Famous used for deals.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.811
The root of the politicians' slush funds.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.272
Right. But how are we going to find that?

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.402
We'll find the answer to that
at this party.

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:26.697
Neither Mr. Famous's house

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.074
nor his gallery had a place
to hide his weakness.

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:32.703
If they are Mr. Famous's public spaces,

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.123
this has to be his personal space.

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.625
All of his illegal conduct
is committed here.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.463
It must be here somewhere.

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.097
The operation will begin.
Is everyone ready?

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:56.810
I'm ready, Boss. Let's do this, Olivia.

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:08.864
Just you wait, Mr. Famous.

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.080
Is this the performing artist's van?

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:18.707
Yes, is everything all right?

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.418
Are you the singer? It can't be you.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.961
I'm not the singer.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.088
Sir, I think you'll have
to show him your face.

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:26.340
But you're so handsome.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.430
I almost didn't recognize you
without your wig.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.848
Hello. I'm a fan of yours.

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:36.850
Don't you have a TV at home?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.772
The director gave me special orders
to guide you.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.570
Mr. Choi.

00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.697
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:52.324
My pleasure.

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:55.202
And may I ask who this is?

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:57.621
This is the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia,

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:58.956
Olivia Kim.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.377
I see.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.755
I've heard much about you.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.632
I'm Choi Seung-chan from LHC.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.468
It's an honor to meet you.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.721
The honor is mine.

00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:18.558
I would have never imagined meeting
such a beautiful lady like you.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.983
I will take that as a compliment.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.070
I have someone to introduce you to.
Come with me.

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:35.075
-What's with that nasally voice?
-What's with that cheesy speech?

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:37.744
What?

00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:50.799
You must be tired. Get some rest.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.052
I'll find a way to handle the performance.

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.644
I got the invitation. I'm going in.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:06.982
Now,

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:10.402
we will begin the special auction.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.530
The first painting was donated
by Mrs. Na Mi-hee,

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.241
the wife of the leader
of the Jinpureun Party.

00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:17.576
Ma'am.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.045
There's nothing special about it.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.546
Why is everyone so amazed?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.381
It's a fascinating work.

00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:33.759
We'll start from seven million.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:34.968
Seven million.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.137
Eight million.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.555
Nine million.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.556
Ten million.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.433
How high will it go?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.186
Hey, Yi-rang. Shouldn't I bid too?

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.354
Don't do anything stupid.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.857
Now, we'll raise the bid increment
from millions to the tens of millions.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.233
Twenty million.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.360
I'm bidding.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.277
Thirty million.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.905
-What's wrong with him?
-Forty million.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.031
Fifty million.

00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:57.616
Eighty million.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.117
One hundred million.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.080
Now, we'll raise the bid increment
to 50 million.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.040
One hundred and fifty million.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.124
Two hundred million.

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:07.376
Two hundred and fifty million.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.502
Three hundred million.

00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.879
Three hundred and fifty million.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.047
Four hundred million.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.757
Four hundred and fifty million.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.509
Five hundred million.

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:20.722
Anyone for 500 million?

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:27.396
Suit yourself.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.273
Anyone else for 500 million?

00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:32.943
Then…

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:35.737
Five hundred million.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.740
Five hundred million!

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:41.868
What a relief.

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:43.620
Sold for 500 million.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.832
Congratulations.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.380
-Please follow my manager for assistance.
-Hey, Yi-rang.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.798
Why are the two leaving together?

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.636
It's creating a chance to bribe
in the name of a charity auction.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.222
So basically, big spenders
get their favors granted.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.266
Is that how it works?

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:05.767
That's right.

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:08.145
My goodness. This is just perfect.

00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:23.243
Here is the last painting.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.913
It was donated by the chairman
of Hundred Victories Group.

00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:29.916
His wife is present tonight.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:34.921
Okay, then.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:36.298
I will reveal the artwork.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.844
The Intangible Cultural Heritage
Number Two,

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.555
the Maltugi Tal
of Yangju Byeolsandae Nori.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:44.931
What? Kkolttugi?

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.600
It was created in the late Joseon Dynasty.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.811
And it couldn't be
in any better condition.

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:51.521
The bid starts from 100 million.

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:52.481
What?

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:53.565
One hundred million.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:54.983
Two hundred million.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.777
-Are they buying it for real?
-Five hundred million.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.446
Eight hundred million.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.655
One billion.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.073
One and a half billion.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.533
Two billion.

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:04.784
Two and a half billion.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.585
Three billion.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.295
Hey.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.964
Are you trying to pull the same stunt?
Seriously?

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.299
Anyone for three billion?

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:21.760
Three billion.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:25.430
Three billion.

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:30.435
Three and a half billion.

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:32.562
Sold for 3.5 billion.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:34.648
Thank goodness.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.525
Congratulations.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.652
We've prepared an after-party.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.238
-I hope you enjoy.
-Three billion, for goodness' sake.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.741
He could make several hundred million won
overnight just from commission.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.110
Okay, I got his fingerprint.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.457
I got the password!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.667
Password secured.

00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:40.630
Behind the frame next to the desk.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.134
Darn.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.078
Hey.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.706
You shouldn't have.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.126
I brought snacks to keep your spirits up.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.711
-Come in.
-Sure.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.510
-The director told me…
-Yeah.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.638
…to get you non-alcoholic drinks.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.017
-Non-alcohol?
-What a considerate man.

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:55.955
CONTROL ROOM

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.929
The control room has been taken care of.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.265
What's wrong?

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.642
Are you okay, Olivia?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.025
Geez. What is she doing
in the middle of an operation?

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:28.780
Do you want to get some fresh air outside?

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.574
Shall we?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:33.618
Let's do that then.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.206
I feel lightheaded.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.791
Oh, boy.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.835
I'm sorry. Be careful.

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.070
Gosh, you flatter me.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.910
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.120
I should've held back.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:00.955
Olivia.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.586
Holding back will make you sick.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.004
Don't hold back.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:26.731
What's that?

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.360
Security! Run to my office! Hurry!

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.277
Yes, sir.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.695
What the…

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.083
I found it.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.293
I got it.

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:00.640
Something wrong?

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.811
Olivia.

00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:09.065
It's dangerous.

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.025
Stay right here.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:13.194
I'll be right back.

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.288
Where are you?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.164
-Get out of there now.
-Not yet.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.332
Wait.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.334
James, buy me more time.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.379
What? I can't hear you.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.172
What? Stop them?

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.174
Where are they?

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:38.344
Got it.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.264
To the right!

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:47.604
Jump!

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.648
Jump higher!

00:19:56.863 --> 00:20:00.950
Okay! Jump!

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:05.288
Damn it.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.281
Check the control room.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:41.199
Yes, sir.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:48.873
What the heck?

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:51.250
Damn it.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:54.921
Hey. Wake up.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.756
I think it's all been deleted.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.132
-Hey, check that too.
-Okay.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:13.523
Hey, who are you?

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.208
That hurts.

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:45.221
CONTROL ROOM

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.093
What's all this noise?

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:25.595
Hey, what are you two doing?

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:27.972
Still partying.

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:36.939
Damn it.

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:57.418
Should I call the police?

00:22:57.502 --> 00:23:00.671
Are you trying to tell everyone
that we got robbed?

00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:02.590
If I lose the VVIPs' trust,

00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:04.258
how are you going to make up for that?

00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:05.760
I'm sorry, sir.

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.145
What's that car?

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:17.772
Stop that car. Now!

00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:19.398
-Stop that car!
-Yes, sir.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.526
Thank you for coming.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.736
Get home safely. Goodbye.

00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:27.323
Here.

00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:29.242
Are you sure you're okay?

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:30.910
It's nothing.

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:32.703
I'm glad to hear that.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.833
Mr. Famous.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:37.750
Thank you.

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:39.127
-Good night, then.
-Good night.

00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:55.059
Should I turn the heat on?

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.644
Yeah, to level four.

00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:00.731
That's not the heat control.

00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:01.691
I thought it was.

00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:06.612
It's on.

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:07.655
Oh, it's warm.

00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:11.784
At least let me change my shoes.

00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:13.327
Come on.

00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:14.704
-I'm drained.
-Geez.

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.038
Why take off your heels--

00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:18.249
-I think I got a cold from Mr. Famous.
-Hey.

00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.960
-Geez. Thanks.
-This way. Careful.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.213
Goodness.

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.383
Good.

00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:30.511
I'm thirsty.

00:24:30.595 --> 00:24:31.888
Guys, you want something to drink?

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.890
Yeah. Maybe chamomile tea.

00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:35.474
No, just drink water.

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:37.351
Gosh, that was really close.

00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:39.020
Let's see what's in this.

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.065
FAME WORK TRANSACTION LEDGER

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:45.276
-Oh, boy.
-Gosh, I'm so tired.

00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.613
Seriously, that was so close.

00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:55.411
This is a huge list.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:56.329
Really?

00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:05.963
Let's check out the VIPs
in league with Mr. Famous.

00:25:06.047 --> 00:25:07.757
This isn't a transaction history though.

00:25:08.132 --> 00:25:10.426
"M27CH dash one." What's that?

00:25:10.927 --> 00:25:12.094
M and F.

00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:14.013
So, male and female.

00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:16.057
Male, 27 years old?

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:23.648
What's this?

00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:40.414
What is this?

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.102
Gosh, this jerk.
He's an even bigger piece of trash.

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:04.188
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:09.819
Would you believe me if I said
even bigger works have been created

00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:11.070
by my own hands?

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:15.157
So he's locking up naive, obscure painters

00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:17.159
and running a forgery factory.

00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:21.539
Wait.

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:24.333
Kim Bo-ra. 23 years old. Kim…

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:31.590
Bo-ra.

00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:54.613
Hey, stop watching.

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:10.004
JAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:32.902
Bo-ra.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.419
Are you feeling better?

00:27:57.802 --> 00:28:01.555
Hey, your mother is worried
because you're not eating.

00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:05.476
You should at least pretend to eat
for your mother. Okay?

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.945
It's cold today.

00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.322
Do you want to go back inside?

00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:31.252
I'll go first and talk with your mother.
Take your time.

00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:36.882
Gu-ho.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:46.225
Mr. Famous…

00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:52.022
He said he'd take a look at my paintings,

00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:53.357
so I went to see him.

00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.488
You're here, Bo-ra.

00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:00.573
It's me.

00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:04.493
You've gotten better from last time.

00:29:05.453 --> 00:29:06.704
Really?

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.666
You're improving every day.

00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:26.348
Bo-ra.

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:27.808
Yes?

00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:29.310
How about working

00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:32.313
as an intern artist at my company?

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.940
An intern artist?

00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:37.568
After the internship,

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:41.572
I'd like to open an exhibition
for people with talent.

00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:44.200
An exhibition?

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:49.455
An exhibition.

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:54.293
You could totally be one of them.

00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:57.338
You're so pretty.

00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:59.715
A debut exhibition at Gallery Fame.

00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:05.012
It was the best bait for students like me.

00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:17.274
I had to endure it.

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.111
I thought that was the only way for me

00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:23.822
to open an exhibition
and debut as an artist.

00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:26.909
But…

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.420
You scumbag!

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:41.006
I did everything you said.
Wasn't that enough for you?

00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:42.758
The exhibition.

00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:44.468
You said you'd open it for me.

00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:46.428
This really is the last time!

00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:52.142
My hand is not listening to me!

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:55.729
But I have to be in the exhibition.

00:30:57.523 --> 00:30:58.524
Professor!

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.152
-I finished it!
-How long do I have to keep painting?

00:31:02.236 --> 00:31:04.113
So please stop this!

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.824
-Everyone was going insane.
-Let me out of here!

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:09.868
And my body was breaking down…

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:13.706
in that short period of time.

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:27.803
I kept telling myself to get it together…

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:30.889
but it was no use.

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.119
That kind Mr. Famous
when he was tossing the bait

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:54.955
was long gone.

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:56.415
Hey, watch it.

00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:02.755
I kept hearing there were minor mistakes.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.632
I guess it was your work.

00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:06.342
No, Mr. Famous.

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:09.553
If I get some sleep, I'll be okay.

00:32:09.637 --> 00:32:11.930
Sleep isn't the issue.

00:32:12.014 --> 00:32:13.265
The issue is your skills.

00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:18.646
But I've been doing well until now.

00:32:19.897 --> 00:32:21.982
I've been working really hard.

00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:24.234
-Now, the exhibition--
-What?

00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:26.445
Exhibition?

00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:28.155
Hey.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:32.451
Do you think you've become a real artist
because you're painting here?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.537
With your disgusting and pathetic skills?

00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.290
You think any damn fool
can hold an exhibition?

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.551
It's tragic to put in all that effort
with zero talent.

00:32:51.053 --> 00:32:54.932
But you definitely said I had talent then.

00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:56.141
"Not bad."

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.894
"You've improved since the last time."

00:32:59.353 --> 00:33:02.981
Do any of those words mean talent?

00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:06.527
I'll be good.

00:33:07.069 --> 00:33:09.488
I swear I can be good. Please!

00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:12.449
Give me one more chance!

00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:14.243
Geez, for Christ's sake.

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:16.286
I can show you now.

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:18.539
Show me what?

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.669
Hey, just get lost.

00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:26.130
Stop ruining my paintings.

00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:30.467
Geez.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.684
And don't do anything stupid.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.436
The security camera caught you...

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:43.689
taking the drugs on your own.

00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:45.441
If you want to call the cops, do it.

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.317
Then, you'll become a drug offender.

00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:50.404
Your mom will be happy to hear
that her daughter is a junkie.

00:34:30.486 --> 00:34:32.404
What? Exhibition?

00:34:32.488 --> 00:34:37.701
Do you think you've become a real artist
because you're painting here?

00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:39.912
With your disgusting and pathetic skills?

00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:42.498
You think any damn fool
can hold an exhibition?

00:34:42.915 --> 00:34:44.458
It's tragic to put in all that effort

00:34:45.626 --> 00:34:46.585
with zero talent.

00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:58.972
Hey, Kim Bo-ra.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.434
Kim Bo-ra!

00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:05.979
No!

00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:20.702
Hey, are you okay?

00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:35.968
Hey, Bo-ra. Come on.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.234
That damn scumbag.

00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:02.661
So? How's Purple doing?

00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:06.164
She's just spaced out all day.

00:36:06.707 --> 00:36:08.375
Gosh, it must be tough.

00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:11.128
She was hurt by the work she loves to do.

00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:15.465
That scum of the earth takes advantage
of innocent passion for his own gain!

00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:17.175
I'm going to stomp all over him.

00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:20.095
This must be it!

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.764
Bo-ra's mom's side dish trifecta?

00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:25.767
Aren't you supposed to ask
how Bo-ra is doing like James did?

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:27.102
James already asked.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.396
What's this? I've never seen this before.

00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:30.355
Is this kimchi?

00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:31.857
It's fermented flounder.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.984
Bo-ra's mother's family
is from Hamgyong Province.

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:35.569
That's where they learned the recipe.

00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:36.778
It's not bad. It's tasty.

00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.409
-It's pure art.
-Right?

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.496
What did you just say?

00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:49.333
Nothing.

00:36:49.416 --> 00:36:50.667
He didn't say anything.

00:36:58.008 --> 00:36:59.092
That's it!

00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:05.223
They don't match the interior design
of the villa I'm moving to.

00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:09.519
Still, there's more artwork
than I expected.

00:37:10.437 --> 00:37:11.855
Let me take a closer look.

00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:21.615
Did your daughter draw this one?

00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:23.200
Just kidding.

00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:24.660
That little…

00:37:26.203 --> 00:37:27.412
You should get rid

00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:30.123
of all these pieces here.

00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.085
They don't suit you.

00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:35.504
You can't just accept everything
that comes your way.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:37.255
They're cracked and broken.

00:37:38.298 --> 00:37:40.258
It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar.

00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:04.533
Mr. Choi, is this…

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:05.492
Oh, that.

00:38:08.537 --> 00:38:11.915
That's from 1933.

00:38:11.999 --> 00:38:13.875
The Sight of the Sea.

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:17.129
The name of the painter
is Cheon Myeong-shin.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.382
That name sounds familiar.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.303
It's beautiful.

00:38:28.181 --> 00:38:30.058
It's so beautiful that it's making me cry.

00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:39.484
What year did you say?

00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.863
It's from 1933.

00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:46.491
From...

00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:49.453
1933?

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:54.541
From 1933?

00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:00.922
The next artwork has an interesting story.

00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:02.716
Perhaps,

00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:06.303
this is a very valuable piece.

00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.138
Piece number 23.

00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:10.515
The Sight of the Sea

00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:12.809
by Cheon Myeong-shin.

00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:18.106
It's from 1933.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.357
It's an oil painting.

00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:21.151
Dimensions are 61 by 50 centimeters.

00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:27.074
The main thing to focus on is the period
in which this was drawn, which is 1933.

00:39:27.157 --> 00:39:29.242
That was during
the Japanese occupation period.

00:39:29.326 --> 00:39:30.869
Unlike other countries that accepted

00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:32.913
various European painting styles slowly,

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:36.875
many painting styles
swarmed into Korea all at once,

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:40.420
so it wasn't easy for each style
to mature during that time.

00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:41.963
However,

00:39:42.798 --> 00:39:45.926
there is always one genius in every era.

00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:47.511
During that difficult period,

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:49.846
one obscure painter we weren't aware of

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.599
used strong brushstrokes and vivid colors.

00:39:52.682 --> 00:39:54.017
Like Fauvism and Cubism,

00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:57.687
as if van Gogh and Cezanne were mixed.

00:39:57.771 --> 00:39:59.856
And the artist has
a unique, delicate touch.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.944
To me, it was a refreshing jolt.

00:40:05.445 --> 00:40:07.489
Now, the decision is up to you.

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:08.740
The bid price starts...

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:11.660
from 15 million won.

00:40:12.953 --> 00:40:13.995
Fifteen million.

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:15.831
Sixteen million.

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:17.457
Seventeen million.

00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:18.834
Eighteen million.

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:19.835
Nineteen million.

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:20.877
Twenty million.

00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:24.005
We'll raise the bid increment
to 10 million.

00:40:24.089 --> 00:40:25.173
Thirty million.

00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:27.300
-Forty--
-One hundred million.

00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:41.815
We have 100 million.

00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:43.066
Anyone else?

00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:45.360
One hundred million.

00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:47.112
Sold!

00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:54.494
In all honesty,

00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:58.248
I never expected you
to say 100 million just like that.

00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:00.542
Let's call it an investment.

00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:04.921
Do you think there's only one painting
done by this artist?

00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.968
When this painting was put up for auction,

00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:11.970
the seller probably
had another plan in mind.

00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.640
I keep thinking…

00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:21.104
we could become the best partners ever.

00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:24.316
What are you talking about?

00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.204
KOREAN ART'S HIDDEN GEM FOUND

00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:40.207
BY DIRECTOR OF GALLERY FAME
AND ART CRITIC, MR. FAMOUS

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.585
I'm an investor.

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:47.464
Do you think there's only one painting
done by this artist?

00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:55.972
If Wonderby purchases all the pieces
by Cheon Myeong-shin,

00:41:57.474 --> 00:41:59.517
the profit will be enormous.

00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:06.316
Secretary Kim, it's me.

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:10.111
Look up Cheon Myeong-shin's paintings.

00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:13.365
Now that I threw the bait,

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.118
there should be a bite.

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:20.121
Sir!

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.457
I got a call that someone
has a similar painting.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.794
Really?

00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:39.057
When I got the call,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.102
I searched thoroughly,
like I was combing for lice.

00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:47.399
So?

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:50.986
Is it one of his paintings?

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:59.869
Sensual texture. Dizzying colors.

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:04.165
This was definitely painted
by Cheon Myeong-shin.

00:43:07.252 --> 00:43:08.086
Sir.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.255
Let me take this painting over.

00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:11.756
I'll pay you triple.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.718
Do you have any information
about this painting?

00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:17.595
I thought I saw something
written on the back.

00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:21.641
Oh, there it is.

00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:25.562
CHEON JONG-YEOP
EUNGSAN-EUP, PAEJU-SI

00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:48.501
CHEON JONG-YEOP

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:52.756
Excuse me.

00:43:53.214 --> 00:43:55.800
Mr. Cheon Jong-yeop? Are you inside?

00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:58.219
I came down from Seoul.

00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.140
-What do you want?
-Geez!

00:44:02.724 --> 00:44:03.558
Gosh!

00:44:04.017 --> 00:44:06.644
Were you peeping in to see
if there was anything to steal?

00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:07.854
Mr. Cheon Jong-yeop?

00:44:14.277 --> 00:44:15.111
Thank you.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.116
Right. Thank you.

00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:24.204
Every guest who visits my house
must drink one.

00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:26.414
It's the rule and a rite of passage.

00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:33.254
I selected only the good herbs
and boiled them in the cauldron.

00:44:33.338 --> 00:44:34.214
I did it myself.

00:44:36.466 --> 00:44:37.467
It's good for there.

00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:38.760
There?

00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:40.470
I mean, down there.

00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:42.347
Do I have to say it? Geez.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.264
Down there.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.893
I see. Down there.

00:44:47.644 --> 00:44:49.521
Down there. Right.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.147
Drink.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.028
Geez, how disgusting.

00:44:58.405 --> 00:44:59.406
It reeks.

00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:04.786
Drink up.

00:45:06.371 --> 00:45:07.205
I…

00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:08.873
-It's a rite of passage.
-Okay.

00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:14.879
-You've passed.
-Thank you.

00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:17.424
By chance,

00:45:18.007 --> 00:45:19.759
do you happen to know Cheon Myeong-shin?

00:45:21.553 --> 00:45:24.597
Let me think.
Myeong-shin. Cheon Myeong-shin.

00:45:24.681 --> 00:45:27.142
That sounds familiar… Yes!

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:28.184
Yes?

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:32.564
Why are you looking for my aunt?

00:45:33.815 --> 00:45:35.316
Well, then…

00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:37.652
are any of her paintings here…

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.197
Oh, my. How did you know
that she was a dauber?

00:45:46.578 --> 00:45:48.413
-Yes, here it is.
-Okay.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.878
I guess she was born in 1919.

00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:57.922
Sir, by any chance,

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:00.758
could I see her paintings?

00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:17.358
She was born frail during difficult times.

00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:19.694
I heard she came close
to death many times.

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.946
But I guess she painted a lot.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.365
It seems she won awards at primary school.

00:46:25.074 --> 00:46:26.993
Goodness, but what's the point?

00:46:27.076 --> 00:46:30.371
She was born to a poor family,
and she was in poor health.

00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:35.502
At the time,
canvases and paint cost a lot.

00:46:36.628 --> 00:46:38.421
To prepare painting materials,

00:46:38.505 --> 00:46:41.466
she delivered milk
when she wasn't even well,

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:43.760
and she even did piles of laundry

00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.304
until her hands were all swollen.

00:46:48.348 --> 00:46:50.683
That year, when it snowed
an insane amount,

00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:53.144
she went out to deliver milk
and never came back.

00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:56.147
So we went out to find her,
and that's what happened.

00:46:58.024 --> 00:46:59.484
Aunt Myeong-shin, you have a visitor.

00:47:00.026 --> 00:47:02.695
Are these all her paintings?

00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:05.406
There's an unnecessary amount,
isn't there?

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.077
How were so many pieces painted
in such a short time?

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.995
Gosh, it was such an ordeal.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.498
Pardon?

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:17.585
I mean,

00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:20.255
she kept painting without eating properly.

00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:22.006
So imagine what happened to her stomach.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.591
Of course, it'd be an ordeal for her.

00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:25.176
Right.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.678
Would it or wouldn't it be an ordeal?

00:47:27.971 --> 00:47:29.013
It would. Yes.

00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:41.693
Sir.

00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:43.987
I will purchase...

00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:46.656
all these paintings.

00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:49.993
My goodness. What for?

00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:53.037
I can give you 100 million won.
How does it sound?

00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:56.499
My goodness.

00:47:57.292 --> 00:48:00.128
Stop joking around.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.090
Then, I'll double it

00:48:04.173 --> 00:48:05.258
and give you 200 million.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.680
Forget it.
I'll trade them for taffies later.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.182
Then, ten million for each work.

00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:14.976
I'll give you 300 million.

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:18.021
Three hundred million.

00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:23.192
My goodness. Is this really happening?

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.695
Then, I will…

00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:36.205
How about three billion won, sir?

00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:40.501
Three billion?

00:48:42.295 --> 00:48:44.130
Olivia, how did you find this place?

00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:47.300
You left in a rush, so I tailed you.

00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:50.470
Are these
all Cheon Myeong-shin's paintings?

00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:53.097
Miss, did you just say three billion?

00:48:53.181 --> 00:48:54.682
Yes, three billion.

00:48:54.766 --> 00:48:57.018
Three billion isn't much
for beautiful paintings like these.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.270
Hold on, sir.

00:49:01.147 --> 00:49:03.274
You can spend that much
without your company's approval?

00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:06.152
I know it's Wonderby,
but don't they have procedures?

00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:07.445
My, what a shame.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.203
Mr. Choi? But why…

00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:19.248
You told me to play in the big leagues.

00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:21.000
So I decided to make an investment.

00:49:21.084 --> 00:49:21.918
Hello.

00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:23.461
Who is this man now?

00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:26.798
They say vices learned late in life
are the worst and you two just…

00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:27.799
Hold on!

00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:30.385
You just said three billion…

00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:32.345
Three and a half billion!

00:49:32.428 --> 00:49:33.429
Three and a half?

00:49:34.222 --> 00:49:37.308
Sir, calm down and listen to me.

00:49:37.392 --> 00:49:40.269
This person is just a buyer from abroad.

00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:42.313
She'll be sending all these precious works

00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:43.940
-to foreign countries.
-What?

00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:46.526
Sir, to this man,
paintings are just money.

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:48.861
You saw it yourself.
He offered only 100 million for all of…

00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:50.405
Seriously, how shameless.

00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:52.407
-Right. Earlier, he said…
-Damn it!

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:56.494
Olivia, you seriously
have it wrong right now.

00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:59.288
But you're a buyer, not an appraiser.

00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:02.250
Turning an amateur painter
from the countryside into van Gogh.

00:50:02.709 --> 00:50:03.543
Only I,

00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:06.838
Mr. Famous can do that.

00:50:06.921 --> 00:50:07.755
Got it?

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.718
Gosh, if you're that good,
why don't you be van Gogh yourself then?

00:50:12.427 --> 00:50:13.553
Sir.

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:15.179
Let me settle this for you.

00:50:15.263 --> 00:50:17.473
I'll buy all
of Cheon Myeong-shin's precious works

00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.644
for four billion won.

00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:22.854
Four billion?

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.064
Four and a half billion.

00:50:25.148 --> 00:50:26.524
Four and a half billion!

00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:28.151
-Five billion!
-Five…

00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:30.486
For goodness' sake!

00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:37.952
What a shame.

00:50:41.289 --> 00:50:42.206
Yes, five billion.

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:46.043
Sold.

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:04.604
In today's auction,

00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:06.856
we'll only feature the works
of an obscure painter

00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:09.233
who hasn't been widely discovered yet.

00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:13.279
This marks the birth of a new star
in the Korean art scene.

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:16.115
The late Cheon Myeong-shin

00:51:17.116 --> 00:51:20.077
was a passionate artist
who poured her soul into painting

00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:23.706
while battling illness
during the Japanese occupation period.

00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:27.335
Her bold drawings and powerful strokes

00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:32.882
capture her aching desire to live
in this masterpiece!

00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:35.384
Hey, that's me.

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:40.097
What?

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.109
Please remain silent. Thank you.

00:51:52.193 --> 00:51:54.278
I said I'm Cheon Myeong-shin.

00:51:54.362 --> 00:51:56.322
I'm not a genius painter
who died at a young age.

00:51:56.405 --> 00:52:00.284
I'm a small business owner who runs
Cheonmyeongshin Shop by the beach.

00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:04.121
I wasn't born in 1919. I was born in 1964,
the Year of the Dragon.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:07.291
I am the mother

00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:09.043
of Kim Bo-ra, my dear daughter.

00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:11.128
Kim Bo-ra?

00:52:36.445 --> 00:52:40.491
So, did you enjoy admiring my paintings?

00:52:41.576 --> 00:52:42.743
Your paintings?

00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:44.620
These are all your works?

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.414
How?

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:51.961
We'll make her a real artist! A real one!

00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:55.923
Then, the paintings will be real,
because they're done by a real artist.

00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:58.384
-A real artist!
-A real artist!

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.973
Well, it wasn't your fault
you were bitten by a rabid dog.

00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:07.018
But whether you fall apart like this

00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:09.353
or get back on your feet

00:53:09.437 --> 00:53:11.397
is up to you.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.944
Sleep on it.

00:53:24.243 --> 00:53:27.872
78 DOKSIMNI, MUN-GU, SEOUL
ANTIQUE ART SHOP

00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:36.255
Look here. Yes, very nice.

00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:38.633
Let's see.

00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:41.928
-Pretty good, right?
-It's a really good picture.

00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:43.721
All right.

00:53:49.852 --> 00:53:52.480
I was worried
just in case you'd recognize it.

00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:57.944
I guess you really admired my talent.

00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:02.740
I painted all of them, everyone.

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:07.078
-What's going on?
-He's a swindler!

00:54:07.161 --> 00:54:08.245
So this was all a scam?

00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:10.790
Historical moment, my foot.

00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:13.250
What kind of trick
are you trying to pull on us?

00:54:13.334 --> 00:54:15.711
That damn junkie must still be high.

00:54:15.795 --> 00:54:17.129
How dare she come in here?

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:19.840
Hey, you little…

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.638
How dare you lay your hand
on my precious daughter?

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:28.224
I'll cut it off
and turn it into radish kimchi!

00:54:30.977 --> 00:54:32.645
-What's that?
-My goodness!

00:54:36.399 --> 00:54:38.734
Are they painting forgeries?

00:54:39.402 --> 00:54:40.820
How is that possible?

00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:42.488
What…

00:54:44.365 --> 00:54:45.408
Show me what?

00:54:47.618 --> 00:54:50.121
Just get lost. Stop ruining my paintings.

00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:53.082
No.

00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:54.375
No!

00:54:55.835 --> 00:54:57.211
What's going on?

00:54:58.337 --> 00:54:59.171
Oh my!

00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:05.386
-What's he doing?
-My goodness.

00:55:08.264 --> 00:55:09.098
Oh, dear.

00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:10.307
How pathetic.

00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:16.397
No. This isn't true!

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.107
This was all fabricated.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:19.734
It's a deepfake!

00:55:19.817 --> 00:55:22.361
That's AI. That's not me!

00:55:22.445 --> 00:55:23.404
Mr. Famous.

00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:24.697
You're Mr. Famous, right?

00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:26.032
What now?

00:55:26.115 --> 00:55:27.158
We received a report.

00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:28.909
A report?

00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:31.370
You're under arrest
for abduction, confinement,

00:55:31.454 --> 00:55:33.789
blackmailing,
and the distribution and sale of drugs.

00:55:34.457 --> 00:55:37.585
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:40.212
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.133
Who are you to arrest me?
Who do you think you are?

00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.051
We can talk later.

00:55:45.134 --> 00:55:46.469
-I'm Mr. Famous.
-Take him.

00:55:46.552 --> 00:55:48.929
I'm Mr. Famous. Don't you know who I am?

00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:52.308
Hey! I'm Mr. Famous!

00:55:53.434 --> 00:55:55.352
Just you wait.

00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:56.687
You filthy little…

00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:12.161
Gosh.

00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:14.330
-Goodness.
-It smells amazing.

00:56:14.413 --> 00:56:16.582
-Be careful.
-No, I got it. Call the kids.

00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:20.503
Hey, come here!
The ramyeon will get soggy!

00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:22.546
Guys, let's run! Let's go eat ramyeon!

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:26.509
I thought Gu-ho was just a clumsy guy
with a handsome face.

00:56:26.592 --> 00:56:27.968
But he's actually pretty amazing.

00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:30.554
I know. I see him in a new light now.

00:56:30.638 --> 00:56:32.389
How about him as husband material?

00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:35.476
What are you talking about?

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:37.520
-What? He's not so bad.
-No.

00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:39.605
Is that really a no?

00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.066
Absolutely not.

00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:43.067
Really?

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.402
-Bon appetit!
-Bon appetit!

00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:47.655
-You lost, so you can't eat.
-No, stop it.

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:48.697
No, I won.

00:56:48.864 --> 00:56:50.866
We scored three goals.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.868
-He's right.
-Right, you scored two.

00:56:52.952 --> 00:56:54.286
-And I scored one.
-No, we…

00:57:04.713 --> 00:57:07.925
FAME WORK TRANSACTION LEDGER

00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:13.973
YU KANG-IL, GHOST CASTLE

00:57:14.056 --> 00:57:15.099
EMPTY TRASH

00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:26.402
DO NOT ENTER

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.671
We should've suspected it.

01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:36.925
We should've seen if he was
a real doctor or just a damn fraud.

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:39.345
Are we supposed to let the kid die?

01:00:39.428 --> 01:00:41.388
You think we'll be the only ones
getting screwed?

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:43.432
She didn't die during surgery.
Isn't that enough?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.894
If we got a good scene
for our hospital's promotional video,

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.187
she's run out of use, you idiot.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.522
How are we going to make them pay?

01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:54.735
Okay. The codename for this operation
will be "Eye and Tooth."

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.320
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:00.449
I'll make sure she experiences fire
and brimstone even in the dead of winter.
