WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.810
Stella Jang.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.010
Your Korean name is Jang Yeon Sook,
correct?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.810
That's a little out of the blue.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
And?

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.450
David Jung.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.250
His Korean name is Jung Ho Se.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.650
And you're his mother.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.690
Was there a son I didn't know I had?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.100
Okay, then let me ask you this.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.230
You sent that portrait to
CEO Min Kyung Chae, didn't you?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.340
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.210
I'm talking about the painting
in your room...

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.010
when I came in here looking for Lucia.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.480
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.880
Are you daydreaming?

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.350
I don't know what your game is,
but get out now.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.580
So, the portrait and Jung Ho Se...

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.620
You're saying you've never heard of them?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.290
My son is in the States.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.360
You're so good at background checks.
You couldn't have missed that.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.060
If you're going to keep stonewalling me,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.800
well, there's nothing more I can say.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.030
What can I say about what I don't know?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170
You're smart.
Why are you being like this?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800
If you insist on acting this way, Madam,
you leave me no choice.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.570
However,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.610
about that portrait...

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.780
Whoever sent it childishly made it look
like a funeral portrait.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.980
It's not like that's going to actually
hurt CEO Min.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.150
It just adds fuel to her fire.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.350
What do you mean by that?

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.560
CEO Min said she was going to find
whoever sent it and make them pay.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.860
It was a stupid move, whoever did it.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.160
They likely thought they could rattle her
with something like that,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.700
but it's not going to go as planned.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.880
That guy...

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.180
That man is as slippery as an eel.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.750
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.060
(New York, 20 years ago)

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.540
Darling, how much longer do I have to
hold this pose?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.470
Just a little longer. I'm almost done.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.380
Make sure you make me look pretty.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.250
You're already beautiful.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.820
All done.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.060
Gosh! This is amazing!

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.900
That's because I had a beautiful model.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.570
Can't argue with that.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.910
This is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.910
If this ever falls into
someone else's hands,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.810
it means I'm no longer of this world.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.520
Because I plan on keeping it
until the day I die.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.740
Did you really have a family?

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.170
Does that mean your family...

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.340
wants me dead?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.910
If Kim Sun Jae went to see you,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.780
he's sure to report it to CEO Min.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.390
It doesn't matter.
There's no proof it was me.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.220
Maybe not right away,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.760
but he'll eventually figure out
the connection between you and your son.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.460
Ho Se and I have no official ties,
so it won't be easy.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.370
Still, the fact that he tracked me down
just from the portrait...

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.370
means he's exceptionally sharp.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.440
This Kim Sun Jae,
what are we going to do about him?

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.610
I'll keep an eye on him for now.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
Understood.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.280
Where have you been?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.820
And what if I have?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.020
Do I have to report my whereabouts to you?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.530
No. Of course,
you don't have to report to me.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.530
But the contract our team sent
to the Legal Team...

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.430
still needs your legal review.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.570
I'm sure someone else will handle it.
The Legal Team isn't short-staffed.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.940
Still, it would be best if you handled it,
Lawyer Kim.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
You're the expert, after all.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.210
Gosh, I can't tell
if that's a compliment...

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.010
- or if you're trying to pick a fight.
- Pick a fight?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.590
- Why would I have any reason to do that?
- Or are you just trying to sound me out?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.460
You need to know what I'm thinking
and what my next move will be...

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.160
so you can prepare yourselves.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.090
That's quite a leap.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.760
Why would I need to prepare
for anything from you?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.230
Well, what a shame.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.870
Because I don't have time to deal with you
for the foreseeable future.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.870
You see, I've just found out
something very interesting.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.480
I don't think I can pay you any attention
for a while.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.050
What a shame.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.100
Se Ri says she doesn't have an appetite.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.070
- Why not?
- Well...

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.340
She says she won't sit with the criminal
who ruined her birth mother.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.480
Oh, just great. Absolutely brilliant.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.220
You're all determined to be the death
of your own father.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.550
There's no other explanation.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.750
Judging by your actions,
it's enough to make me lose my appetite.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.020
Seriously.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.030
Please eat more.
I heard you barely touched your lunch.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.730
Please put something simple on a tray.
I'll take it up to her.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.230
You will?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.270
Of course.
I should be the one to handle this.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.270
I'll try to calm her down,
so don't worry and finish your meal.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.790
Eat.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.560
Get it out of here.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.000
Eat it.
The chairman is worried about you.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
This is why you can't be a sister
to Kyung Chae.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.540
Seriously, why are you starving yourself?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.510
This is when you need to eat properly
more than ever.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.910
So I can have the strength to fight?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.210
Ultimately, thanks to you,

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.680
my sister and I
are now worse than strangers!

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.850
The two of you could never be
on the same side anyway.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.890
One of you will become the successor
to Mingang Distribution.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.390
So isn't it obvious what will happen
to the one who's left behind?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.560
It's not because of me.
This was always your destiny.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.170
You just had to turn us sisters
against each other.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.080
- Is this why you came into our family?
- It's "Mom," not "you."

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.920
Besides, what reason would I have
to drive you two apart?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.250
Unless...

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.990
Think carefully.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.460
I signed away my rights to any shares
when I married the chairman.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.130
That means if I ever leave this house,
I'll walk away with nothing.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.460
So what motive could I possibly have?

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.230
If it's not my father's fortune,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.670
then you must have another motive.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.770
All done?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.370
There's my good girl.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.140
Let's go talk in your room.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.760
She seems to lay it on even thicker
in front of you.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.790
So it seems.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.930
She should just get on Father's good side
and squeeze a penny out of him.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.330
I don't understand why
she's so fixated on Se Ri.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.430
The problem is Se Ri.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.440
You haven't spoken much with her lately,
have you?

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.710
No, I haven't.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.140
But that woman is with Se Ri
all day long, talking nonstop.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.640
They even sleep in the same room.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.220
Ms. Min,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.390
there's nothing more heartbreaking
than having your child taken from you.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.330
You have to get Se Ri away
from that woman.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.000
It's been a while, CEO Min.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.770
Welcome. Please, have a seat.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.440
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.750
I wonder what you wanted to see me about.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.450
Meet with Stella Jang
first thing tomorrow.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.320
And when you're with her,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.320
you must tell her that a trashy portrait
like that means nothing to you.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.430
Like someone who can't be rattled.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.760
Why do I have to do that?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.330
I'll explain later.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.430
It's the best way
to mess with those trying to break you.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.240
- I don't understand what you mean.
- Just trust me,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.270
and please do as I say.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.540
Lucia... No...

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.280
This is our first meeting
since my stepmother's wedding.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.850
You say "stepmother" so naturally now.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.450
What choice do I have?
I have to accept reality.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.120
I was overly sensitive at the wedding,
saying that you two were in cahoots.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.720
So you realize it was a misunderstanding?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.190
Does that mean we can go back
to the way things were?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.590
Of course.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.640
This must be a portrait of you.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.270
My gosh! What is this?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.770
This isn't a funeral portrait.
Who on earth did this?

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.980
I know.
It's such a childish, immature prank.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.110
I actually find this kind
of thing laughable.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.750
I don't know who did it,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.560
but I'd love to see the face of the person
who pulled this pathetic stunt.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.930
"Pathetic stunt?"

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.530
The nerve of her.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.160
So this is nothing to you, is that it?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.170
Secretary Kim.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.070
Get rid of this trash.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.110
"Trash?" How dare she...

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.040
I have a meeting scheduled today,
so now isn't great,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.640
but we should have a meal sometime.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.710
She made a point of calling me here.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.780
And with that innocent face,
she acted like nothing had happened.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.650
Kim Sun Jae must have coached her.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.460
For her to come here and sound you out
means she's suspicious but lacks proof,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.790
so she's just fishing.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.500
If that's her game, we can't stand by.
It's time to drop that bomb, isn't it?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.950
That's my wife's handiwork.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.250
Your wife?

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.180
Lucia.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.820
She replaces them when they start to wilt,
and she takes excellent care of them.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.770
I'm here to report
on what you asked me about.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400
You mentioned...

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.970
that you were looking for a mole...

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.340
who hid their identity
and infiltrated Mingang.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.280
Did you find them? Who is it?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.910
Who could it be, Moon Tae Kyung?

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.720
Don't you have anyone in mind?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.980
Why are you asking Director Moon?

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.350
Just on a hunch.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.390
I just had a feeling he might know.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.360
What are you talking about?
Are you playing games with me?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.460
Of course not. Play games?
How could I do that to you, sir?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.830
I suspected someone,
so I did a little digging.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.000
- It turned out to be a dead end.
- What? So it was a false lead?

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.440
You made all this fuss over that?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440
My apologies.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.090
Kim Sun Jae.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.390
So you think you can toy
with people like that?

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660
It's me.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.170
I have a favor to ask.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.630
Could you find out CEO Min's schedule
for tomorrow?

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.700
All of a sudden? Why?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.570
Min Kyung Chae has to find out, too.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.140
She needs to learn
who is responsible for what happened...

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.910
to the man she loved more
than life itself.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.480
(Mingang Distribution)

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.350
What is it?

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
Well...

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.620
Do you happen to have any plans tomorrow?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.560
There's something I need to discuss
with you in private.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.130
I'm sorry.
I have prior engagements tomorrow.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.130
I have a meeting with Chinese buyers
about our online distribution.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.730
Oh, well then...

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.140
Where is your appointment?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.040
If you don't mind,
I could wait for you nearby.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.140
At Mucheon Klimp, 3 p.m.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.780
But I think it'll run late.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.180
Is it urgent?

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.750
No, it's not.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.420
Then I guess tomorrow won't work.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.020
Then just tell me here and now.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320
Some other time.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.670
Tomorrow, 3 p.m., at Mucheon Klimp.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.570
(Jung Lucia, tomorrow at 3 p.m.
at Mucheon Klimp)

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.920
Thank you.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760
Be careful.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.160
And don't forget that
I'm always worried about you.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.540
What did Moon Tae Kyung say?
Why the long face?

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.270
It's nothing, really.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.450
I mean, honestly,
ever since that woman moved in,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.250
we haven't had a single quiet day.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.150
And you know, my husband says...

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.320
that this time, that woman was why...

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.790
Kyung Chae
and Se Ri had that huge blow-up.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.090
- Is that so?
- She's a total troublemaker.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.760
Why are you bad-mouthing someone
who isn't even here?

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.730
Has anything gone wrong
since my stepmom moved in?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.070
Oh my goodness!

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.200
My stepmom is ten times better
than Kyung Chae.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.770
Kyung Chae is cold and selfish,
and that's all she is.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.410
You shouldn't say that.
Blood is thicker than water, after all.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.610
Sometimes the bonds you make are stronger
than the ones you're born with.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.980
You and that woman...

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.720
I mean, your stepmother,
it hasn't even been that long.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.650
It's not about time,
it's about the connection.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.650
You wouldn't understand.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.170
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.900
Welcome!
Oh, are you just finishing up?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.710
Yeon Ah, my fellow hometown girl!
Business still booming?

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.040
You know it. Just leave it all to me.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.550
Looks like a customer was here
about 25 minutes ago.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.750
Oh, honestly. You're just unbelievable!

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.350
Do you think she can't handle it herself?
You were born suspicious, I swear.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.820
So, is everything all right at home?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.890
Oh, there's plenty happening.
Not at our house, but with our in-laws.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.060
Oh? What's happening over there?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.600
Don't even get me started. It's chaos.
Those two sisters fight constantly,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.800
and our Ja Kyung can't get
a moment's peace.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.470
Oh my, that's awful!
Is it something serious?

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.570
That's all because my in-law is useless.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.810
When the man of the house isn't respected,
that's when trouble starts.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.550
If it were me, Oh Pan Sool,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.980
I'd have disowned my children
on the spot and sold them online.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.950
Oh, please.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.720
If you were in charge,
it'd be a madhouse.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.320
You're the type to drink an Americano
with fish sauce...

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.660
and be like, "Oh, what an interesting mix
of bitter and salty!"

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.730
I, Oh Pan Sool,
am the last true patriarch of our time.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.600
Patriarch...

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.900
Patriarch.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.780
Let's meet outside tomorrow
for a change of scenery.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.380
Tomorrow?

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.920
Your daughters are at each other's necks.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.650
It must be so upsetting for you.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.120
Let's eat out together
and get some fresh air.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.270
Did you enjoy your meal?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.710
Getting out really helps clear my head.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.440
See? What did I tell you?

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.510
Try not to worry about it so much.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.010
My kids are the only ones
who don't have a clue.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.020
How they're making me rot
from the inside out.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.950
How can kids understand a parent's pain?

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.890
Not unless rivers start flowing uphill.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.590
By the way,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.170
why hasn't your oldest daughter
married yet?

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.770
She's such a catch.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.100
Kyung Chae... It'll be hard
for her to ever get married.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.440
Years ago, I came between her
and some guy she was in love with.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.240
Why? If she loved him,
you should've approved.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.350
What was I supposed to see
in a penniless artist?

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.380
I'd rather have her die single
than give her to a bum like that.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.150
So you broke them up?

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.660
You think he went away quietly?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.230
He must have smelled money
because he clung to her like a leech.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.600
So, what happened to him?

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.230
You know me.
You think I'd let that stand?

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.300
My policy is to remove problems early.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.030
They definitely said
he had an accident in the States...

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.030
Don't tell me my father...

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.270
Did the meeting with the buyers go well?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.910
You said that man died in a crash
in the States, right?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.410
You mean...

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.280
David Jung?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.080
Yes. In a car accident.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.820
Did they ever catch
the one responsible?

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.250
They did catch someone, but...

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.090
Come to think of it,
something was a little strange.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.490
The homeless man who was identified
as the culprit...

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.500
was an alcoholic
and could barely communicate,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.000
but he went out of his way
to the police station to confess.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.830
That's ridiculous.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.500
- What's wrong?
- That...

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.640
is exactly the kind of trick
my father would pull.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.110
Do you think Min Kyung Chae
heard everything?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.750
She definitely heard everything.
She was too close not to.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.320
What about Min Doo Sik?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.720
He didn't notice a thing.
He went right into the company, after all.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.590
You think she'll just stand by
after finding out her father hurt her man?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.430
Not a chance. Not with her personality.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.940
Move.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.270
I'm not in the mood
to deal with you right now.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.170
And you think I am?

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.740
Too bad, though.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.840
This is just our fate.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.050
We're destined to always stand
in each other's way.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.420
The least you could do is apologize.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.050
For what you did to my mother.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.090
I said, apologize!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.600
I thought I told you
I was not in the mood.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.160
You knew she couldn't say no,

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.900
so forcing her into that nursing home...

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.230
was a crime.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.140
I said, move.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.810
I don't have time for the likes of you.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.540
I have a bone to pick with my father.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.880
Confront me about what? Go on, try me.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.220
Was it you, Father?

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.490
Were you the one who did that to him?

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.290
What are you talking about?
Make some sense!

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.960
The man from 20 years ago! Jung Ho Se!

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.330
Did you kill him, Father?

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.060
Don't be ridiculous!
What do you take your own father for?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.970
I heard you say it yourself,
loud and clear.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.600
What could you have possibly heard?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.440
What's wrong with you?
Looking for a fight?

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.340
First, you raise hell with your sister,
and now you're coming after me?

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.850
I chose you over your incompetent brother.
You should be grateful!

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.350
What are you questioning?
You think you have a right to question me?

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.680
If I hadn't done that,
you wouldn't be where you are today!

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.150
Father!

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.250
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.590
Even if I could go back,
I'd do the exact same thing!

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.330
For what I did,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.460
I don't regret it one single bit!

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.570
The nerve!

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.440
Oh, my head...

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.580
Looks like Lucia really started a fire
in that family.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.450
So, does that just leave the son?

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.820
He has an inferiority complex...

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.520
because of his
two accomplished younger sisters.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.390
And he's obsessed with the inheritance
he'll get when Chairman Min dies.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.200
I figured as much.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.700
A forged will.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.940
For a simpleton like Min Ji Seop,
this is the perfect bait.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.410
(Last Will and Testament)

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.590
Gosh...

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.890
Goodness...

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160
Oh my, is your head hurting again?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.170
After the scene Kyung Chae caused earlier,
how could my head not hurt?

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.240
And the medicine isn't even helping.
What are we going to do?

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.270
Any more stress and I feel like
I'm going to collapse.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.640
I need to get some rest.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640
Gosh.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.260
I guess you're not one to support
your husband, are you?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.700
Excuse me?
What is that supposed to mean?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.830
The chairman has been so distressed lately
because of his two daughters.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.070
Wouldn't it be great if his son were
to step up at a time like this?

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.240
Step up how?

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.840
To be a dutiful son.
And make up for his sisters' behavior.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.610
He'd win his father's favor, wouldn't he?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.780
It's the perfect opportunity.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.520
This is the chance for your husband
to finally win his father's approval.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.530
So that woman is telling me
to be a "good son?"

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.900
Well, she's not wrong.
You should use this to win his favor.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.630
I mean, how often does an opportunity
like this come along?

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.230
If this is about Father's inheritance,
I don't need to try so hard.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.170
He's not going to forget about
his one and only son.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.810
Kyung Chae and Soo Jung can be
as capable as they want.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.310
Once they're married, they're out.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.710
Who'll be by Father's side in the end?
You think he doesn't know that?

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.250
- Come on, darling.
- You don't get it.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.850
Father only gives me a hard time
on the surface.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.120
Deep down,
he has it all planned out for me.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
Darn it.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.030
Go to work with your father.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.540
I told you,
it was easier for me to go on my own.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.270
Were you even listening to me yesterday?
While your father is sick of your sisters.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.180
I said go score some points.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.750
- Gosh.
- Oh, seriously. Fine.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.750
Father.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.760
What? Did he leave already?

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.700
(Last Will and Testament)

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.440
What?

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.520
Mingang Distribution goes to Kyung Chae,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.050
and the chain stores to Soo Jung...

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.520
and all the real estate to Se Ri...

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.490
Lucia?

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.090
Wait, why her?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.430
Wait a second, what about me?

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.860
- Why am I not in here?
- Oh, my.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.070
Should you be reading that?

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.570
You're his son, but reading his will...

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.940
The chairman left early
for a breakfast meeting.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.740
Is this will for real?

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.180
I'm asking if it's real!

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.780
You should go now.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.950
I won't tell the chairman you saw this.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.150
Darn it.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.460
- Darn it all.
- Honey, what is it?

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.530
Honey!

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.730
Father!

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.170
Did you decide to stop knocking?

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.810
Where are your manners?

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.780
That's right!
I have no manners whatsoever.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.550
I'm not afraid of anything.
You got a problem with that?

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.080
What's gotten into you?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.920
Did you hate me that much?

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.920
Even for a disappointing son,
how could you?

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.790
People say that a parent loves
all their children equally.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.590
You even took care of that woman, Lucia.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.890
What are you talking about?
Start making sense!

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:35.030
Did you think I wouldn't find out
that you left me out of the will?

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.940
Father, please tell me it's not true.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.970
But still, when you pass away,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.440
I'm the one who has to
serve you at your own memorial!

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.810
You insolent brat!

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.450
Gosh, my head...

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.450
Before his own father is even
in the grave,

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.050
what kind of son harps on about a will
when his father is still alive?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.290
Get out!

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.860
Get out this instant!

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.390
That...

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.660
(Mingang Distribution)

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.330
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.940
No...

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.830
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.250
The chairman's will!

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.710
If you'd shown me sooner,
this would've been avoidable.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.520
For now, we must fight tooth and nail
to protect our shares and your father's.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.220
From now on, Moon Tae Kyung,
you will keep influencing Oh Pan Sool.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.030
Are you saying we can stop CEO Min
from becoming chairman?

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.630
I think the time has come.
I should prepare to take over as chairman.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.170
