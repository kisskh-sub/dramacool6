00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.310
(Mingang Distribution)

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.160
Chairman!

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.260
Chairman.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.770
Oh, gosh...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.030
Here.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.410
Are you all right?
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.780
I'm fine.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.780
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.290
Oh, dear.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
Why don't you go see Dr. Kim?
I'll take you there.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.430
No, I'm telling you, there's no need.
I'll be fine with some rest.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.230
By the way, what brings you here?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.900
Seriously...

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.670
What in the world is going on?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.640
My heart started racing,
and I got anxious.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.040
I came here on a hunch.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.010
Who knew I'd find you like this?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.710
Without me, you could've collapsed,
and no one would've even known.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920
Chairman, if you keep this up,
something terrible could happen.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.520
Just come home with me.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.960
You need to rest.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.360
Please, Chairman.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.640
(Episode 70)

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.270
Hey!

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.180
And you call yourself my friend?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.210
What are you talking about?
I was busy, and you're making no sense.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.480
Hey, Kim Sun Jae!
How could you do this to me?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.550
If you want to marry Kyung Chae,
you can't be treating me like this.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.750
Don't you know who I am?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.220
I'm Kyung Chae's brother.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.160
- Keep this up, and I'm leaving.
- The chairman's will!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
If you'd shown me sooner,
this would've been avoidable.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.530
I would've come up with a plan
or something!

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.470
What are you on about now?
What about the chairman's will?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
You're going to play dumb to the very end,
aren't you?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.570
Fine, forget it.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.380
Fine. Keep sucking up to my father.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880
See how well that serves you.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.680
Get out of my way!

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.620
What in the world was that about?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
Vice Director Min.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.560
You've been away from your desk all day.
What on earth have you been doing?

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.900
- That's not the problem right now.
- Then what is?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.900
You wouldn't understand this feeling,
would you, Director Moon?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.710
That feeling when you think
something's yours, but it isn't. No.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.640
it was mine at first, but now it's not.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.580
What in the world are you talking about?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.680
You're lucky you don't have siblings
to fight with over an inheritance.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.950
Excuse me?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.290
Be even happier you don't have a father
to fight for your inheritance.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.290
Stop the nonsense and show me the proposal
that was due today.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
Director Moon!

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.970
- Yes!
- I can't work today.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.470
There's no way I can work
feeling like this.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.300
Darn it!

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.370
What's wrong with him?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.410
Gosh!

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.380
How are you home at this hour?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.750
The chairman is unwell.
Don't let anyone in his room.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.360
Especially his son.
He's absolutely not allowed in.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.120
This way, Chairman.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.100
Wait, why isn't my husband allowed in?
What did he do wrong?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.770
What's gotten into them all of a sudden?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.280
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.210
So in the end,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.350
you handled him
just like you always do, Father.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.880
I will never forgive you.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.150
Whatever happens from now on...

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.420
is on you, Father.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.730
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.470
From now on, I'm going to start managing
the board members.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.570
Especially Director Kim Jin Chul.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.240
Apparently, his son got into some trouble
in the US.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.340
Team up with a local lawyer
and get the charges dropped.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.680
As for Director Jung Woo Sik,
bury his daughter's admission scandal.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.410
And for Director Cheon Myung Tae,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.080
find a solution
for his greenbelt land issue.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.780
Why all of a sudden?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.420
When have I ever done things differently?

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.390
In exchange,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.860
you need to ensure that in an emergency,
their shares in Mingang Distribution...

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.330
are transferred to me.
Make those terms perfectly clear.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.460
Why are you suddenly consolidating
Mingang Distribution shares?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.400
Because I think it's time.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.270
Time for what?

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.970
It's time I started preparing
to become the chairman.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.570
Wait, then what about the chairman?

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.040
A generational shift.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.250
At any other company,
it would have happened ages ago.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.650
If anything, it's overdue.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.130
The back of your head.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.900
What? Goodness.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.070
No, you've got a full head of hair now.
What are you doing here?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.640
- Sir, what brings you here?
- I asked you first.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.640
You've no business at Mingang Distribution
at this hour.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.410
So, what brings you here?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080
Well,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.820
the truth is, I work for this company.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.420
Really? My goodness!

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.020
Why didn't you say anything?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.920
I thought you were at some tiny company.
I was completely in the dark.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.630
Seriously, why the secrecy?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.630
I wasn't trying to be secretive,
it's just that...

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.100
Oh, my, look who it is.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.760
Hello, sir.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.670
Ms. Stella.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.940
Again and again.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.840
And again!

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.850
We meet again.
We meet again, my dear lady.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.420
Ms. Stella, to what do I owe the pleasure?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.120
I'm a non-executive director,
so I'm here for a meeting. And you, sir?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.550
For a meeting as well.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.660
Ms. Stella. I have followed your lead...

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.560
and become a non-executive director
for Mingang Distribution.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.530
Is that so? How wonderful.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.900
- It seems we'll see each other often.
- Indeed, we will.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.470
Why does fate refuse to leave us alone
and insist on bringing us together?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.940
Such a meddlesome fate.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.440
What if we grow fond of each other?
You know how people are.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.150
The more you see them, the more you care.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.080
Oh, dear. If I end up falling for you,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.920
- that would be a problem.
- Don't see it as a problem!

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.420
If you fall for me, then just give in.
I'll make sure you can never escape.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.060
Can we control our hearts?
The heart wants what it wants.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.830
- From now on, you and I, Ms. Stella...
- Please, call me Stella.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.470
And in return, I'll call you Pan Sool.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Pan Sool.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.480
Pan Sool...

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.510
That's the first time in my life
anyone's ever called me that. Pan Sool.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.110
Stella. Tella.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.520
After the meeting, how about you and I
get a bitter coffee and make it sweet?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.320
I'd love to, but I have stocks
to sell before the close.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.690
Maybe next time.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.730
Tella!

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.500
S...

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.300
Stella!

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.630
Stella!

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.600
S...

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
Stella.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.710
- Oh, dear.
- Chairman, I told you I would escort you.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.080
You don't know what this meeting's for.
I'll be right back.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.290
Do you really have to meet them today?
You're not feeling well.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.090
Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.160
It's a prior engagement.
I can't postpone it.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.660
I'll be back.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.570
I've told you to stop worrying so much.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.710
Keep this up,
and you'll be in serious trouble.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.510
Your brain scans.
If they get even a little bit worse,

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.780
they'll be identical
to a dementia patient's.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.680
Are you saying I'm going to get dementia?

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.250
Who can say for sure? Only the sky knows.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.890
I'm just saying you need to be careful.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.760
Dementia doesn't exactly announce
its arrival.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.160
You don't want to end up like Chairman Mo
of Inam Construction.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.230
I heard Chairman Mo became like a toddler,
who can't even use the bathroom.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.270
Perhaps because he was always so healthy,
the symptoms progressed so quickly.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.740
His biggest regret must be...

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.680
not deciding which child to leave
the company to while he was still lucid.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.280
Exactly. People like us
must decide on a successor in advance.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.480
Aren't you leaving Mingang Distribution...

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.250
to your eldest daughter?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.260
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.800
If it's what I need to become chairman,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.170
are you willing to give me
your shares in Mingang Distribution?

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.510
Why the silence?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.640
That's not how you make a deal.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.380
Shouldn't we feel out
each other's terms first?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.320
Just what I'd expect from you, Lawyer Kim.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.820
You're right.
I suppose we should align our terms first.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.730
Oh, right.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.660
By the way, about that painting...

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.630
- Who delivered it?
- Director Moon Tae Kyung.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.000
He picked it up in the lobby
and brought it up.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.550
Chairman, you're in such bad shape,
something could happen at any moment.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.150
And your unexplained headaches.
They could be from your brain surgery.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.830
I keep telling you, dementia is
not just somebody else's problem.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.630
Dementia can be a side effect
of brain surgery.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.270
Should I hand over the chairmanship
to Kyung Chae?

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.900
Then again,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.170
she is the most qualified candidate
among them.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.310
But why do I have this nagging feeling
in the back of my mind?

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.320
Here's some warm herbal tea.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.760
Where's my wife?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.420
She's in Ms. Jung's room.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.360
They get along well, don't they?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.360
Get along well? That's an understatement.
They're inseparable.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.370
If I were to step down,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.270
who do you think
should take over as chairman?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.940
Wouldn't it be Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.040
I thought that was your plan all along.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.310
That was the plan,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.950
but after what she did to Soo Jung's mom,
it's been weighing on my mind.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.350
Once she becomes the chairman,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.550
she might get rid of Soo Jung
and her half-wit older brother...

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.190
in the same way.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.260
Surely she wouldn't.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.860
She'll purge anyone
who falls out of her favor.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.560
At that rate, it's only a matter of time
before the entire Min Family is destroyed.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.700
But Ms. Kyung Chae is the one
who's most like you, Chairman.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.840
- That's what you always liked about her.
- It's true. I did.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.840
But now,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.170
that's the very reason it bothers me.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.180
- Is that what Father is saying?
- Yes.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.650
He said that based on what you did
to Ms. Soo Jung's birth mother.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.120
He's afraid you'll deal with others
in the same way.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.650
I understand.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.960
Who do you think I learned that from?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.760
You're the one who taught me, Chairman.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.500
For you to get cold feet now is a problem.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840
Oh, gosh.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.810
You're not a three-year-old. Don't cheat.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.910
- He's here.
- Oh, he's here.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.110
Come on in.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.020
I prepared something special
as thanks for your help the other day.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.850
Goodness, all this chicken?

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.620
Thank you, sir. I can't wait to dig in.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.020
This looks absolutely delicious.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.790
This isn't just any chicken.
Go on, have a bite.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.530
Here you go.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.900
Oh, thanks.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.630
You'll see this is no ordinary chicken.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
It starts in the heart,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.440
goes through the mouth,
and hits the brain.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.650
Gosh.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.120
This is so delicious.
The texture is incredible too.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.390
I know, right?
The chicken is spicy with a bit of a kick.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.820
It's doing the samba twist on my tongue.
Samba!

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.930
Go on. Keep it up. Go on all night.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.990
Samba!

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.560
All right, let me try some.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.630
My goodness.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.270
It's like my dopamine ran away from home,
and now it's rushing back home.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.070
- I feel a samba coming on too.
- Samba!

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.110
Samba! Wait, get the cold rice.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.950
- I bet it'll be the perfect combination.
- Cold rice?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.220
Oh, chicken and rice!
I'll be right back with it.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.150
- Bring the green onion kimchi too!
- You got it. Samba!

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.190
Actually, I was waiting for you.
There's something I wanted to ask.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.530
It's about that Ms. S.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.100
Ms. S?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.900
I mean Stella Jang.
I heard her mention an evening market.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.740
- Is she involved in that sort of thing?
- Oh, you mean Ms. Jang?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.480
Ms. Jang is known as a stock market whale
because of her aggressive investing.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.650
And I understand she's made a fortune.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.180
What? She's got the looks and the brains,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.990
and she's rich too?
We're a match made in heaven!

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.150
Samba!

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.010
Yes, it's me, Ms. Jang.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.110
I've already mentioned you to him.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.310
He's absolutely obsessed with money,
so he seems interested.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.550
Excellent.
From now on, Mr. Moon, you need to...

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.790
keep planting ideas in Oh Pan Sool's head.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.090
The thing about investing is
you sink all your cash into it,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.260
and when that doesn't work, the next step
is to sell off your real estate.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.860
If he keeps this up, he'll have to sell
his shares in Mingang Distribution.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.370
And if we can get our hands
on those shares,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.970
we can stop CEO Min
from becoming the next chairman, correct?

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.110
Exactly.
And if we add your stock options...

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.250
Still, the deciding factor is
how much Lucia...

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.550
can manage to get
from Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.650
To get Chairman Min Doo Sik
to hand his shares over to Lucia...

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.150
Well, that's not going to be easy.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.720
Is anything about this easy?

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.490
What if she gets hurt in the process?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.200
You're only worried about Lucia,
aren't you, Mr. Moon?

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.270
Don't worry. That's not going to happen.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.190
You should establish a succession plan
in advance.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.560
It's not like you'll be
in that position forever, Chairman.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.370
He's right.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.070
It's not like I'm going to live forever.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.480
How can you sleep at a time like this?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.990
According to your father's will,
you and I are about to be flat broke.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.160
I don't even want to talk about it.
The more I think, the angrier I get.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.300
When you called,
I felt like the sky was falling.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.570
Don't just sit there. Why don't you
go talk it over with Kyung Chae?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.640
What good has she ever done for me?

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.510
- Then what about Soo Jung?
- You think she's any different?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.750
For now, we must fiercely protect
your shares, mine, and Father-in-law's.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.450
As long as we have our shares,
Kyung Chae and Soo Jung can't touch me.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.520
Whoever wants to be chairman
will have to come to us for help anyway.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.890
How can you not even think about becoming
the chairman yourself?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.830
What do you want me to do?
Look at the situation we're in.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.170
Whoever wants to become chairman
will send an SOS for the shares.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.570
So tell your father to hold on tight
to his shares.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.750
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.780
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.790
What is it now?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.460
Getting so defensive over
a simple greeting between colleagues.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.190
Since when were we on terms to be
greeting each other?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.560
Look, Director Moon.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.630
There's something I'm curious about.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.600
Would you mind giving me
a straight answer?

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.200
What is it you're so curious about?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.780
You're smart, so give it some thought.
See if my hypothesis is correct.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.710
You know, about the CEO's portrait.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.550
You see, I saw that painting once
at Ms. Jang's hotel.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.420
- And?
- But now, it's in the CEO's Office.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.790
I looked into it,
and the artist is already deceased.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.930
Normally, posthumous works are kept
by the family.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.530
Which would mean Ms. Jang...

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.300
could be part of
the artist's surviving family.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.670
Stop spinning tales so early
in the morning.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.210
It's boring, uninspired, and pointless.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.180
Anyone can tell it's a third-rate story.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.210
And what adds credibility
to this "third-rate story..."

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.650
is you, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.990
The one who put the painting
in the CEO's Office.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.920
If you did it at Ms. Jang's request,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.620
then that's proof you two are one team.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.510
Kim Sun Jae is getting dangerously close
to the truth about you and your son.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.040
He can't do anything right now
without proof,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.280
- but you should be careful.
- All right.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.550
Gosh, that Kim Sun Jae.
Annoying, repulsive, and good-for-nothing.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.460
Now I see why Min Kyung Chae
doesn't think of him as a man.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.160
In any case, with things as they are,
we can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.500
Hello.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.670
Am I speaking with Chairman Min's wife?

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.710
Yes, speaking.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.910
- May I ask who's calling?
- This is Doctor Kim.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.950
The chairman came in for a consultation
a while ago.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.120
I'm calling
because I thought you might be worried.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.320
The chairman did?

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.150
You didn't know?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.860
The fact that he kept quiet
about his hospital visit...

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.930
means he didn't want
the results to get out.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.960
It must be serious enough
for him to hide it.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.000
What's certain is
that Chairman Min is going to start...

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.500
seriously considering who he'll name
as his successor.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.870
Min Kyung Chae was the frontrunner,

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.470
but this means
he's having second thoughts.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.910
I think Min Kyung Chae disappointed him
over the Min Soo Jung incident.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.980
She'd thrown her sister's birth mom
into a place like that and let her die.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.720
That would weigh on my conscience too.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.550
He trusted her the most among his kids
because she was so much like him.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.390
But now,
it seems he's having reservations.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.360
That's how it is
with your own flesh and blood.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.630
He's seen how Min Kyung Chae treats people
who cross her,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.470
and he's reluctant
to put someone like that in his seat.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.870
He probably thinks
Min Ji Seop and Min Soo Jung...

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.540
could be dealt with the same way.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.980
No father wants to see his own children
at each other's throats.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.650
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.650
Ji Seop, what are these documents?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.520
Oh, they are...

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.060
You should take a good look, even now.
See which of your kids is truly capable.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.460
Ji Seop, why do you always do this?

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.200
Didn't I tell you to report
to my office first?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.170
- No, I was just...
- How many times do I have to tell you?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.140
Please earn your keep.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.980
She's capable, but she's too aggressive.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.910
She walks all over her own older brother.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.320
Ji Seop, that thing I mentioned last time.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.690
Oh, here it is.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.560
These must go to the CEO's office first.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.690
I need it, so I get it first.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.800
Gosh, then Kyung Chae
is going to chew me out again...

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.130
She's just like her older sister.
Good grief.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.700
And him? Don't even get me started.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140
Are you okay?

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.610
Yes.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.110
- The documents should be fine.
- No, not the documents. Are you okay?

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.790
Your children are an option,
but do you have to pick one of them?

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.990
Someone who is capable and compassionate,

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.560
and who won't betray you, Chairman.
Choosing someone like that would be wise.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.270
Is he talking about Lucia?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.250
What are you so deep in thought about?

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.450
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.820
You really brighten up
the Chairman's Office.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.720
I told you I'm in charge of the flowers,
didn't I?

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.660
Don't let anyone else touch them.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.060
All right, I won't.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.990
Did you come all this way just for that?

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.000
This and that.
I was also worried about you.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.900
I'm telling you, I'm fine now.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.600
There's nothing to worry about.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.390
It's time for dinner.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.790
Right.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.130
Go get Ji Seop.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.000
He says he doesn't have an appetite.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.270
Tell him to get down here, no matter what.
It's an order from his father.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.410
And bring Soo Jung as well.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.490
Honey, your father's asking for you.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.460
I said I'm not eating.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.230
I know I'm spineless, but how can I
eat at the same table as him?

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.370
The man doesn't even treat me like a son.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.210
After seeing his will,
I can't even see him as a father anymore.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.910
Come on, at least pretend to eat.
Your father is in a terrible mood.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.850
No.
Eating with him will just make me sick.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.520
Even if you throw up later,
just eat something for now. Okay?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.520
What can we do about the will?
It's out of our hands.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.460
I'm telling you, your father is
in a really bad mood.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.900
- Come on, let's go. Now!
- I really don't want to.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.700
I already told you. I can't eat
at the same table as Min Kyung Chae.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.270
How long are you going to keep this up?
Enough is enough.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.740
Are you just going to avoid her
for the rest of your life?

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.240
Yes, that's the plan.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.480
Oh, so you're on Min Kyung Chae's side,
aren't you?

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.180
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.220
Whether you come down is your decision.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.160
But the chairman doesn't seem
to be in a good mood right now.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.460
If I go down by myself,
I can't promise you what will happen next.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.330
Have you all forgotten we're supposed
to eat at least one meal together a day?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.470
Why didn't you guys come?

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.040
Am I a joke to you?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.380
Is your headache back?

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.380
You people are just too much.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.590
Why make things so hard for the chairman?

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.850
Do you know how much stress he's under?

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.820
What if something happens to him?
Will you take responsibility then?

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.500
Are you in a lot of pain?
Should I get your medicine?

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.900
It'll pass.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640
Chairman?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.540
This isn't good. Let's get you up.
Go to your room and rest.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.450
Chairman!

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.420
What are you all doing? Call 911!

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.990
Chairman!

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240
What's all the commotion?

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.050
Did something happen?

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.420
Chairman,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.650
are you all right?

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.220
Why? Is something wrong?

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.560
A moment ago,
you were suffering from a headache.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.260
A headache? What headache?

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.730
My head's never been clearer.
I feel great.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960
What are you all waiting for?

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.930
Hurry up and eat.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300
Okay?

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.140
I said, let's eat.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.980
Gosh, this hits the spot.
This cod stew is excellent.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.280
Right?

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.950
I told you to eat.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.900
What's the matter, Chairman?

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.370
Who do you think I am?
How dare you serve me this?

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.210
Darn it.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.310
This filth.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.750
You all can eat this trash!

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.820
You all can eat this trash!

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.890
Eat this trash!

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.720
- Eat this trash!
- Oh my!

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.160
You expect me to eat this trash?

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.530
You vile creatures, eat it all!

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.260
Eat it all!

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.400
You all eat it!

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:01.220
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.270
Why is he acting like that?
Anyone can see it's dementia.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.970
Does he really have dementia?

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.040
If he really has dementia,
then the whole plan is off.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.050
After all we've done to get here,
you're telling me it just ends like this?

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.520
What if he has an ulterior motive?

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.620
That's what it's like to be a parent.
You're relieved they take after you,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.290
but it's also horrifying.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.990
Father, if keep this up, you're of no use.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.030
You know what happens then, don't you?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.800
