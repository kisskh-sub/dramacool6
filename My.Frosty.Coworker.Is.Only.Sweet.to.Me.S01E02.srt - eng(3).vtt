00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:06.598
I'm not sure if we can handle so many changes...

00:13:09.765 --> 00:13:13.398
We will have to get it done in the next three days.

00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:15.198
I'll help out, too.

00:13:15.198 --> 00:13:18.265
No, you've got the Avaz competition, Uehara.

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:19.480
Right, but...

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.198
Thanks, Risa. It's okay.

00:13:22.198 --> 00:13:28.532
I want to do what I can, since the Florena staff were so awesome.

00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:40.165
We're going to have to redo it from scratch, basically.

00:13:40.165 --> 00:13:43.198
We will never finish!

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.398
We're not going home today, are we?

00:13:45.398 --> 00:13:47.365
No...

00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:51.798
Here, everyone, sugar...

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.565
to pump you up.

00:13:54.565 --> 00:13:57.332
It's your favorite, Kotori-san. Are you sure it's okay?

00:13:57.332 --> 00:14:00.065
Of course! Eat up, you must be hungry.

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:03.032
This will keep us going for a while. ("Sugar" sounds like "for a while.")

00:14:03.032 --> 00:14:05.132
Get it?

00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:12.398
Shall I split it into three equally and eat? (homophones)

00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:37.450
Looks like we're working late again today.

00:14:46.898 --> 00:14:49.798
Everyone is worn out.

00:14:52.198 --> 00:14:54.532
Okay, everyone.

00:14:54.532 --> 00:14:56.698
Let's all go home for today.

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:01.365
But the deadline...

00:15:01.365 --> 00:15:04.532
Exhaustion affects your judgment and speed.

00:15:04.532 --> 00:15:06.732
You'd make dumb mistakes.

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:09.532
So let's go rest.

00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:16.298
Tomorrow, we will work even harder to finish before the deadline.

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:17.798
Okay.

00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:21.298
- Kotori-san!
- Ogata-san!

00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:23.130
What about you, Ogata-san?

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.865
Will you go home, too?

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:31.553
Yes, I'll go home, too.

00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:44.432
Finally going home!

00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:47.365
Good night!

00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:49.165
Kotori-san, you go home, too.

00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:51.765
I will, once I lock up.

00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:56.198
Make sure you eat properly, take a bath, and sleep in your beds.

00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:57.865
She's like a mom.

00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.640
- Bye.
- Good night.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.853
Good night.

00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:04.465
Good night to you as well, Soma-kun.

00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:18.365
All right then.

00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:21.432
I'll do as much as I can.

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:24.531
There...

00:16:37.232 --> 00:16:42.298
I'm exhausted. I need sugar.

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:46.065
I want that dorayaki.

00:16:55.832 --> 00:16:57.598
Hello?

00:16:57.598 --> 00:17:00.798
Ogata-san, are you still at the office?

00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:06.635
N-No, I'm home.

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:13.598
Soma-kun, what's wrong?

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:18.098
Liar.

00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:22.518
Why are you here?

00:17:23.998 --> 00:17:26.065
Did you have dinner?

00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:30.690
I grabbed some stuff. Take a break and eat.

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:34.598
Also... here,

00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:36.730
though it's not Aiya's.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.098
How did you know?

00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:42.165
I'm always watching you.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:51.470
I was waiting for you to ask me for help.

00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:55.798
I'm your boyfriend before I'm your co-worker.

00:17:58.198 --> 00:18:00.532
Lean on me more.

00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:09.418
Thank you.

00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:15.132
Thank you! I'm so happy!

00:18:15.132 --> 00:18:18.590
Eat that and take a break.

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:21.765
Really, thank you so much!

00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:23.350
No problem.

00:18:24.432 --> 00:18:26.665
Oh, what's this?

00:18:26.665 --> 00:18:27.998
Looks good, right?

00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:29.732
It does.

00:18:29.732 --> 00:18:32.198
I've never seen this before.

00:18:35.932 --> 00:18:40.365
I'll handle the system stuff so send it all to me.

00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:42.998
Got it. Thanks so much.

00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:57.965
I uploaded the data.

00:18:57.965 --> 00:18:59.972
Okay.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.998
Let's see...

00:19:02.998 --> 00:19:04.832
Should be good now.

00:19:04.832 --> 00:19:07.365
I think we will make the deadline.

00:19:07.365 --> 00:19:09.432
Yes.

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:21.620
Thank you, Soma-kun.

00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:27.065
Likewise. Thank you for relying on me.

00:19:38.798 --> 00:19:41.032
We're sleepy, aren't we?

00:19:43.598 --> 00:19:45.032
Good morning.

00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:48.198
What? You two did all this?

00:19:48.198 --> 00:19:53.098
Kotori-san, you did this secretly? You should have told us!

00:19:53.098 --> 00:19:56.765
- It's fine; Soma-kun helped me.
- I see.

00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:59.998
What? Where did Soma-kun go?

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:04.398
He looked totally drained so I told him to nap.

00:20:04.398 --> 00:20:05.898
You go take one, too, Ogata.

00:20:05.898 --> 00:20:08.365
Yes, get some rest.

00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:11.765
Leave the rest to us!

00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:15.098
Thanks, I will.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.798
- Amazing!
- Back to work!

00:20:17.798 --> 00:20:20.780
- You did great.
- Yes, I did my best.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.098
Good morning.

00:20:22.098 --> 00:20:24.110
- Let's catch up on yesterday's work.
- Morning.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.920
Good. I'm counting on you.

00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:07.732
What is this feeling?

00:21:07.732 --> 00:21:09.598
Thank you.

00:21:17.698 --> 00:21:19.878
You're leaving?

00:21:20.998 --> 00:21:23.598
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:28.665
No, I'm too hyper; I can't fall asleep.

00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:31.398
Was there a problem?

00:21:31.398 --> 00:21:33.398
No.

00:21:33.398 --> 00:21:37.298
Is there anything you want, Soma-kun?

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:43.298
As thanks for the food and for helping me out.

00:21:45.965 --> 00:21:47.632
Then...

00:21:50.998 --> 00:21:53.098
As my reward,

00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:58.998
will you kiss my cheek?

00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:32.632
Just jok...

00:22:37.198 --> 00:22:38.670
S-Sorry!

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.560
I... I really meant to just kiss your cheek!

00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:46.298
I didn't think you'd turn.

00:22:47.565 --> 00:22:52.232
Go back to sleep! Rest up, okay?

00:23:04.932 --> 00:23:09.965
Come on! My first kiss wasn't meant to be an accident!

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.270

[Preview]

00:24:31.398 --> 00:24:33.832
I haven't seen you since high school.

00:24:33.832 --> 00:24:35.965
- I didn't recognize you.
- A social gathering?

00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:37.265
- I'll go.
- Will you?

00:24:37.265 --> 00:24:40.265
Is he the one who hurt you?

00:24:40.265 --> 00:24:44.632
I'll say it again and again. I like you just the way you are.
