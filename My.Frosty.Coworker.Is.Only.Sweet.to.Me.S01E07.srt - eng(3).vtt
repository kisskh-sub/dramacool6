The president of Aiya, the store you love so much...

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:09.386
is my brother.

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:12.753
Thanks for caring for my otouto.

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:16.730
It wasn't that it was a secret.

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.320
I just didn't want to be asked about it.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.320
My brother and I are actually half siblings.

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:38.753
My mother died when I was eight.

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:43.353
My father took me in afterward.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.770
There you are.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.430
Come here.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.510
It's sudden and you might not believe this,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.953
but I am your father.

00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:11.370
It had been just me and my mom. I didn't know my father.

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:14.410
Suddenly...

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.690
I had a new mother

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.290
and a slightly older brother.

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:25.653
That was Ayato-san?

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:32.286
He was already being groomed to manage the store.

00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:35.620
I looked up to him.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.720
I wanted us to become friends.

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.880
So I started to help out, too.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.590
When I did,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.750
my dad began to praise me.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.786
You're dexterous with a knack for this.

00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:03.800
I'd be happy if you could support this store with Ayato someday.

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:06.653
Here, let me help you.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.120
People with cold hands have warm hearts, you know.

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:21.853
Like that, yes.

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:25.886
It made me so happy.

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:31.890
But around that time,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.020
my kind brother started to change.

[My Frosty Co-worker Is Only Sweet to Me]

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:42.586
One day, I was making sweet red bean paste on my own.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.470
It turned out so good, I wanted my brother to try it, too.

00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:50.140
When I took it to him, he said,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.470
"Don't try to take my place!"

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:56.520
"You're the mistress' child!"

00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:58.653
So...

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.640
Then I realized that he didn't like me.

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:11.953
Don't you think you're being too hard on Ayato?

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:15.353
You only treat that other boy kindly.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:20.253
Quiet. What if he hears you?

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.920
Ayato will own the business. A little discipline is necessary.

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:32.020
Meanwhile, that boy lost his mother.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.653
He needs some kindness, right?

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:40.620
You never know what people really think.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:48.053
Sometimes coldness or warmth can mean the opposite.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.653
I don't like traditional Japanese sweets.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.553
It reminds me of my brother and that house in Kyoto.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.006
Soma-kun...

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.590
But after joining the company and meeting you,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.650
I realized not everyone is like that.

00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:33.353
But you know, I didn't feel this way at first.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.386
I can't ignore you!

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.020
Your hand is ice cold!

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.100
Hang on.

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:46.670
I thought that your kindness

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.353
and your being nosy were just for show.

00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:53.653
Ask for help when you're having a hard time.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:06:00.353
But even at work, you never wanted anything in return.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:08.120
When I realized that kindness was your only motivation,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.586
I had already fallen for you.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:18.657
I'm not good at understanding other people.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.320
I make lots of mistakes and get ahead of myself.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.620
I don't want to give you up to anyone!

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.753
- I want you to fall in love with only me.
- I love you, Soma-kun!

00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:33.110
Every time I mess up with people,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.320
you accepted me as I am, Kotori-san.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.253
I'm so glad I fell in love with you.

00:06:56.786 --> 00:06:59.053
Soma-kun...

00:07:08.207 --> 00:07:11.107
Thank you for telling me.

00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:14.438
Thank you...

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:19.620
for listening.

00:07:22.586 --> 00:07:27.960
Words like "I'm so sorry," or "It must have been hard,"

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.080
weren't enough at all.

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:37.853
All I could do was hold him tight.

00:07:41.053 --> 00:07:43.720
It's so quiet today.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.020
Yes, Uehara and Soma are out seeing a client today.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.286
I've never seen Uehara-san be in such a panic.

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:56.920
Might be a bit before it's sorted.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.749
Soma-kun was quite shaken after seeing his brother.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:07.149
Maybe it's for the best he's busy with work.

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:09.640
Still...

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:16.096
Can I do anything to help him?

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:21.153
Kotori-san, someone is here for you.

00:08:22.686 --> 00:08:25.120
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:30.965
Excuse me?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.750
Hello again.

00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:39.653
Soma-kun's brother?

00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:45.053
I came to inspect our Tokyo store so I brought you this,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.220
because you left abruptly last time.

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:54.860
Here you go.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.253
My gosh, thank you.

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:06.653
So why exactly are you here?

00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:14.888
It's a very pleasant company.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.356
Pardon?

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:21.820
Well, such politeness from the lady though I had no appointment.

00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:30.120
You seem to enjoy our sweets a lot.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.653
Yes, I love them!

00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:38.550
My favorite is your dorayaki.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.686
The red bean paste that isn't sweet is so good.

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:48.286
I can't eat any other dorayaki now.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:52.220
I'm very glad to hear it.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.020
Thank you.

00:09:55.753 --> 00:09:58.753
I brought them for you so have some.

00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:00.486
Thank you.

00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:08.820
My mother always asks me to bring some to her when I visit.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.220
They're hard to find back home.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.786
About that...

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:25.020
I'd like people who live far away to taste our products, too.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.320
So I want to start an online shop.

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:35.653
I came today to consult you about it.

00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:40.653
I thought this was about Soma-kun.

00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:46.370
My father is quite traditional.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:53.853
He is content with just our Kyoto store customers.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.686
But we won't get new customers that way.

00:10:57.686 --> 00:11:03.086
Plus, I want the younger generation to appreciate traditional sweets more.

00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:05.986
I agree!

00:11:05.986 --> 00:11:11.786
I think young people should learn to appreciate this flavor.

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:18.820
So I'd been looking for the right person for the job.

00:11:23.586 --> 00:11:25.420
Ogata-san.

00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:31.820
I would like you to do it.

00:11:33.253 --> 00:11:34.586
Me?

00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:36.020
Indeed.

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:40.850
The foremost qualification is to love our sweets.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.320
I looked at your company's prior work and atmosphere.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.286
Oh, he's shrewd.

00:11:48.286 --> 00:11:51.886
But the chance to design Aiya's site...

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:55.986
I'll have our PR department contact you officially.

00:11:55.986 --> 00:12:00.920
And please give my regards to my otouto.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:07.886
Although I'm quite sure he won't like it.

00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:12.453
Yes, I doubt Soma-kun will react well to this.

00:12:17.386 --> 00:12:19.286
Incidentally...

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.820
Are you his girlfriend, Ogata-san?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.786
I, well...

00:12:30.786 --> 00:12:33.353
No need to hide it.

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:40.186
He'd never come so close to Aiya's door if not for a girlfriend.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.320
Well...

00:12:44.953 --> 00:12:51.586
Take good care of the website and my otouto, please.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.786
Right.

00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:05.831
Designing Aiya's website is like a dream!

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.153
Will Soma-kun be okay with it, though?

00:13:13.153 --> 00:13:18.386
I did tell him that I talked to his brother, but...

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:25.553
Coming.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.486
Kotori-san! Are you okay? Did he try to do something?

00:13:33.486 --> 00:13:35.320
I-I'm fine.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.686
Here.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.586
Thanks.

00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:43.920
We just talked; that's all.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.953
What about you? I heard the job was rough.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:52.953
I was worried about you so I powered through and got it done.

00:13:52.953 --> 00:13:55.220
Wow! Incredible...

00:13:56.053 --> 00:14:00.320
So what did you two talk about?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.653
Well...

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.280
Actually...

00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:12.353
Oh, you're freezing!

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:17.020
I'll get you a hot drink. Sit down for a bit.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.420
Okay.

00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:26.344
Aiya's website?

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:27.819
Yes.

00:14:29.153 --> 00:14:33.920
He wants me to create a website with an online store.

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:39.353
He wants more people to enjoy traditional sweets.

00:14:39.353 --> 00:14:44.286
He finally got your father's approval to proceed.

00:14:44.286 --> 00:14:46.620
I see.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.220
Did he say anything else?

00:14:52.653 --> 00:14:56.486
Are you his girlfriend, Ogata-san?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.053
He asked if I was your girlfriend.

00:15:11.986 --> 00:15:16.453
I've loved Aiya's sweets for ages.

00:15:16.453 --> 00:15:20.186
Working on it would be so amazing.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:22.586
I actually don't want you to do it!

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:33.000
Honestly, I don't want you to get involved with my brother.

00:15:35.486 --> 00:15:37.853
You mean...

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.420
I'm being selfish.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.786
But that's not the only reason!

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:47.453
He's a perfectionist and very demanding.

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:51.286
I've seen him grind down many employees.

00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:54.353
I don't want you to get hurt.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.653
Sorry for saying something selfish.

00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:24.284
Okay.

00:16:30.353 --> 00:16:32.220
Thanks.

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:39.494
Now that's settled, I think I'm crashing.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.720
He had been working nonstop.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.686
He must be exhausted.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.753
Get some rest.

00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:07.106
Everyone, listen up.
[Idee]

00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:09.590
We have a new client:

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.540
the famous sweets shop, Aiya.

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:17.406
- Kotori, did you hear that?
- For real?

00:17:17.406 --> 00:17:20.106
Ogata-san loves Aiya's dorayaki!

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:24.440
She disappears right after work to go buy them!

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.640
So of course, Kotori is in charge.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.340
Perfect fit!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.973
Also, he personally requested Ogata.

00:17:30.973 --> 00:17:34.206
What, "personally"? That's amazing!

00:17:34.206 --> 00:17:37.140
- Like a fish to water!
- It's "a fish in water."

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.673
So how about it?

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.573
Kotori, what is it?

00:17:46.573 --> 00:17:49.340
There's no reason to decline, right?

00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:03.510
I appreciate the offer,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.000
but I'm busy with other clients.

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:09.473
I'd like to decline.

00:18:13.873 --> 00:18:15.740
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.973 --> 00:18:34.706
Kotori?

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.360
Oh, Risa.

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:40.773
What was that about?

00:18:40.773 --> 00:18:44.106
It was a job from your beloved Aiya.

00:18:44.106 --> 00:18:47.706
I can help out with the other clients.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.340
What's the matter?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.706
Did something happen?

00:18:54.706 --> 00:19:00.040
Or don't you like the sweets anymore?

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.840
Of course not.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.006
I've loved their sweets for ages.

00:19:04.006 --> 00:19:07.273
Then why did you decline?

00:19:10.006 --> 00:19:12.506
Because...

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.206
I get it.

00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:24.340
Some things matter more than work.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.450
But let me ask you one thing.

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:36.040
Won't you regret turning it down to see another made it?

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.906
Regret...

00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:46.240
If you know for sure, then I won't say more.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.700
But if that's not the case,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.840
think about it once more.

00:19:55.573 --> 00:20:00.906
If you don't take it, it'll likely go to Hata-chan and me.

00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:05.073
And we don't really like traditional sweets.

00:20:12.073 --> 00:20:15.740
I can't say for sure that I won't regret it...

00:20:17.773 --> 00:20:22.540
But when I think how Soma-kun will feel...

00:20:23.673 --> 00:20:28.680
[Japanese Sweets, Aiya]

00:20:30.573 --> 00:20:32.873
What should I do?

00:20:32.873 --> 00:20:39.140
If I pass it up just because Soma-kun asked me to...

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.573
I might eventually blame Soma-kun that I couldn't do this job.

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:54.758
I'm sure I can find another way to help Soma-kun.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.906
Okay.

00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:06.440
I'd like to do the Aiya website job.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.006
Excellent, Ogata!

00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:10.640
Okay.

00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:14.006
Everyone, listen.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:20.273
Ogata will be handling the Aiya website project after all.

00:21:20.273 --> 00:21:22.073
I knew it!

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.473
That's great!

00:21:24.473 --> 00:21:29.506
The client seems excited. They sent many sample photos already.

00:21:29.506 --> 00:21:31.673
Direct everything to Ogata.

00:21:31.673 --> 00:21:33.040
Yes.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.965
Thanks, everyone.

00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:37.997
- Thank you, too.
- You've got this, Kotori.

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:39.423
Thanks.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.973
I'll send you all the details. Check your email.

00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:43.206
Okay.

00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:46.873
- Let's get working!
- On it!

00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:49.106
What are you doing?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.106
I thought hard about it.

00:21:56.975 --> 00:22:03.440
I knew I'd regret it if I didn't accept the job.

00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:09.350
I know about the animosity between you two, but...

00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:11.840
I'm sorry.

00:22:14.206 --> 00:22:16.706
But I...

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:21.506
I really want to create Aiya's website.

00:22:23.073 --> 00:22:25.873
Now you're in charge.

00:22:25.873 --> 00:22:29.373
My brother is so demanding.

00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:33.273
I'm sure he will throw absurd demands at you.

00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:37.515
I'm ready for it.

00:22:40.306 --> 00:22:45.573
And if we can build a good working relationship,

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:50.406
- maybe you'll feel different...
- Leave me out of this!

00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:52.740
I want nothing to do with him!

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:02.960
He makes me...

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.370
upset like this.

00:23:08.926 --> 00:23:12.759
This is why I wanted you to stay away.

00:23:17.173 --> 00:23:21.706
I've never seen Soma-kun like this before.

00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:26.840
I'm going to go cool off.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.906
Soma-kun!

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.773
I hurt him.

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:47.630
It was never my intention to make him so sad.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.200

I'm sorry I made you so unhappy.

I've got your back. I'll protect you. I'm your boyfriend, after all.
