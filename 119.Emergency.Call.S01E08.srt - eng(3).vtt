00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.300
It was never your fault, Yuki.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.870
Because...

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.850
that fire...

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.190
was my fault.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.820
You don't need to force yourself to speak.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.030
You just went through a harrowing experience.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.160
Besides, it was simply an unfortunate accident.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.720
Sunlight reflecting off a mirror by the window

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.440
caused the fire, right?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.860
Yes.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.920
So it's really not your fault, Konatsu.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.990
I want to tell you

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.850
what I haven't been able to say until now.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.930
That day was Yuki's birthday, right?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.280
Sweetie, he had to go to work.
[25 years ago]

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750
But he promised he'd stay for my birthday.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.480
Daddy's a liar!

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.170
Then why don’t the three of us go out and play?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.940
I don't want to!

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.720
Oh, what to do?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.620
Daddy told me to grant any wish you have, though.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.430
"Any wish"?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.120
- Yes!
- Then I want to see snow!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.550
"Snow"?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.330
- Can we not?
- Well...

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.670
You said any wish! Mommy, you're a liar, too!

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.160
Yuki.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.620
What are you making?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.860
No peeking! It's a secret.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.610
Okay, I won't.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.010
I'm going to pick up a cake. Can you two stay home for a bit?

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.810
Sure. See you later.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.160
[Happy Birthday, Yuki!]

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.590
This was...

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.900
the real cause of the fire.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.630
I'm sorry I never told you all.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.470
I should have told you back then.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.630
A fire caused by light?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.140
When sunlight passes through glass or reflects off a mirror

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.130
and focuses onto one spot,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.830
that spot can heat up and start a fire.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.000
The exact cause is unclear,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.760
but it was most likely due to sunlight

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.790
reflected from a mirror on the windowsill.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.920
But I couldn't

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.750
because I was too scared.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.350
I'm truly sorry.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.160
You were carrying that burden all by yourself?

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.460
You must’ve been hurting so much.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.950
I'm sorry we never noticed.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.270
Thanks to you, I was able to move on.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.050
Everyone acted like the fire never happened.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.550
And those memories began to fade away.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.380
That day,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.720
I told you I wanted to be a dispatcher.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.270
Did that trigger those memories?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.380
That's why your voice...

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.230
That's not it.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.400
But...

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.620
Your words did trigger the memories.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.590
But what shocked me was

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.460
the fact that I did nothing even though I caused the fire.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.620
That's why it's not your fault, Yuki.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.450
I wanted to support you, too.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.300
But it was too hard.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.560
Rather than tell you the truth and make you worry,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.810
I thought it was better to distance myself from you.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.790
That was why you stayed away?

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.980
I'm very sorry.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.240
You even saved me.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.650
But I couldn't do anything.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.600
That's not true.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.330
That's not true at all!

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.840
You were the one who taught me.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.600
For the police, call 110.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.430
For fire or ambulance, call 119.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.210
"For the police, call 110."

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.930
"For fire or ambulance, call 119"?

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.920
Yes! Great job!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.510
You taught me to call 119 for a fire.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.420
I was able to call 119 at that time

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.150
because of what you taught me.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.210
Thanks to you, we were rescued, Onee-chan.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.500
Besides...

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.200
You made this

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.090
because I complained about wanting to see snow, right?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.360
That means the fire was ultimately my fault.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.790
No.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.490
If we're going by that logic,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.420
then it's my fault for saying I'd grant any wish.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.690
Now hold on.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.190
Isn't it because I broke our promise

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.540
and went to work

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.130
that Yuki got upset?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.360
- Fair point.
- Indeed.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.430
- I suppose it's all your father's fault.
- What?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.250
Well, I guess...

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.270
Wait, what?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.030
Then let's say we're all at fault.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.740
That's right.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.010
It's everyone's fault,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.580
but it's also all thanks to us. That's who we are as the Kasuharas!

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.060
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.930
What a weird tagline.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.840
What do you mean "weird"?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.950
Creating taglines is my job.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.170
All right, shall we have some cake?

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.850
- "Cake"?
- Don’t tell me you forgot your birthday!

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.260
Oh, right. I forgot.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.880
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.730
- Okay, everyone, help set the table.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.640

- Thanks.

[Letter of Resignation]

Thank goodness the snow didn't pile up.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.290
So many calls would have come in.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.130
But I’m sad that as an adult, I can no longer enjoy snow.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.960
Why do you put it that way?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.280
- Morning.
- Morning, Sir.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.940
Morning.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.100
Just so you know, I still get excited about snow.

- Seriously?
- See?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.700
That’s how it is.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.200
The GPS malfunction we recently observed

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.600
has affected both Squads 1 and 2 as well.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.000
Though we're checking our systems, the exact cause remains unknown.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.500
What if it's caused by solar flares?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.100
- "Solar flares"?
- Explosions that occur on the sun's surface.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.000
These can cause network disturbances and damage satellites as well.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.300
And if a satellite breaks, that messes with our GPS systems.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.600
- Isn't that bad?
- It is.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.800
Solar flare activity increases about every 11 years.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.000
- And this is that eleventh year!
- Okay, enough.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.400
- Don't jump to conclusions before we know the exact cause.
- Right.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.080
For now, please be extra thorough in obtaining

the caller’s location from them.

- Yes, Ma'am.
- Good luck.

Can you really say no to that face?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.700
Sure. I got it.

Thank you in advance, Sir.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.300
I'm sure you already know this,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.700
but our most important task is to monitor and support the dispatchers.

"Monitor and support."

You sometimes lose sight of your surroundings while answering calls, right?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.900
Yes, all the time.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.000
That’s when the assistant commander ensures

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.200
the dispatcher doesn’t miss any key details.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.500
"Living State," Room 801, Takinami-san's residence, correct?

Understood, I'll send an ambulance right away.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.400
I’d like to ask you a few questions.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.200
That’s why it’s our responsibility to press the “Emergency Site Located” button.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.100
That's a heavy responsibility.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.150
There’s another important thing about our job.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.720
What do you think it is?

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.100
- Well...
- We shouldn't hesitate.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.600
- Is that correct?
- If you answer, it defeats the purpose.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.200
- Sorry, Sir.
- "We shouldn't hesitate"...

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.700
Even if the dispatcher is more experienced,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.900
you need to point out what's necessary.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.200
Seniority doesn't matter in critical situations

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.500

I think my back's given out. I can't move.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.000

The house across the street is Sato's.

I can't.

I see. Is there a telephone pole near you, Sir?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.300
There should be an address or serial number on it.

- Yes, there is.
- What does it say?

Are you having difficulty breathing?

Yes, but this is only because...

Hello, this is Kasuhara from Command.

This is Captain Iwashita of the Okatsu paramedic squad.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.200
As the designated location is on a steep hill,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.230
we determined the ambulance couldn't handle the slope.

[District 6, Koganezaka]

I knew it.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.300
We then determined it was best to carry the injured man down on a stretcher,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:07.000
except that he... claims to weigh about 170 kilograms (375 lbs).

"A hundred seventy kilograms"?

to carry him down the slope.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.600
That slope is within a neighborhood, correct?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.800
Are there any homes with empty garages nearby?

The home right in front of us, actually.

If so, a publicity minivan can go all the way up and park there, right?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.000
Wouldn't it be safer to transport him in the vehicle?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.100
If the homeowner lets us use their garage, of course.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.000

But it’s your first time, after all.

And though I've never heard it myself,

rumor has it Dojima-san was an expert at giving verbal orders.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.000
Apparently, his tone alone could indicate how grave the situation was.

Still...

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.550
I'll stay until Kasuhara becomes a fully-fledged assistant commander.

So this is that slope.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:14.540
We determined the ambulance couldn't handle the slope.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.420
He's right. This incline would be dangerous for an ambulance.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.260

My doctors say I need to lose weight.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.300
If I had also noticed the caller's physique at this point in the conversation,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.970
I could have dispatched the appropriate squad from the start.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.060

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.120
This sure is an incline.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.150

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.690
that you always check locations that concern you.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.620
Kaneshita-san did?

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.910
He's been bothered by the fact

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:08.210
that he failed to notice the slope or the caller's physique.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:14.410
But as assistant commander, I should've had a better grasp of the situation.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.460
I share the blame as well.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.460
Given my experience, that address should've been familiar.

Besides,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.050
the paramedics might have their own regrets as well.

Pardon?

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.900
They probably wish they knew this area better.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.900
Then they could've done something differently

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.150
before being dispatched.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:47.240
We're not a team of superheroes.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:54.290
That's why we all need to work hard together.

Is he conscious?

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.240
Hand me that phone!

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.350
We’re calling because he’s unconscious. Get moving!

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.910
So he's unconscious. Is he breathing?

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.160
He's moving his mouth, but I'm not sure!

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.790
Understood. He may not be breathing, so he needs CPR.
[Dispatch]

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.850
Would you follow my lead and administer it to him?

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.960
Just tell me what to do!

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.580
Will do. Please put us on speakerphone first.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.360
Yokohama Fire calling Kohoku paramedic squad.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.790
This is Kohoku paramedic squad.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:10.270
A 35-year-old man has collapsed at a construction site.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.830
Our dispatcher is currently assisting with CPR procedures, over.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.120
Copy that, Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.980
Our rhythm is one, two, one, two. Ready?

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.230
- One, two, one, two.
- One, two.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.430
- One, two. Perfect.
- One, two, one, two.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.640
One, two. Keep that up.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.540
One, two, one, two.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.980
This sound...

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.690
One, two, one, two.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.040
Yogo-san, ask them where in the construction site they are.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.110
If they're up high, we'll need to send a rescue squad as well.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.180
Sir, continue as I ask this question.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.600
Where are you in the construction site right now?

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.010
We're on some scaffolding.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.960
You need to tell them how high up we are!

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.960
R-Right. We're 7 meters above ground.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.660
Thank you.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.460
Yokohama Fire Bureau to Kohoku.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.310
We read you. Go ahead.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.800
The man has collapsed on scaffolding 7 meters off the ground.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.220
We will be directing a rescue operation first, over.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.460
Copy that, Fire Bureau.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.660
Kasuhara-san.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.230
You can handle assistant command alone from now on.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.870
What? Already?

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.590
You have Dojima-san's seal of approval.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.720
Thank you.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.480
Congrats.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.740
- Congratulations! You're amazing!
- Impressive!

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.320
On that note, could I have everyone's attention?

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.280
Well, you see...

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.220
Dojima-san has chosen to retire at the end of this month.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.600
What?

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:10.890
Since he has unused paid time off, today will be his last day at work.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.220
Why so sudden?

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.570
He never gave me a reason.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.810
Actually...

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.020
I may know why.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.610
Dojima-san.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.860
Could I have a minute?

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.870
What? Need some advice?

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.750
Have you been to a hospital yet?

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.150
Throat discomfort, persistent cough,

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.220
coughing up blood...

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.090
If you have those symptoms, you may have...

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.220
Throat cancer.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.980
I know.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.090
With a dispatcher this well-versed in medical knowledge,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.350
Command is in good hands.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.400
Throat cancer?

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.430
If it's progressed far, his vocal cords would need to be removed.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.100
In other words,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.550
he could lose his voice.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.710
That's why he's chosen to quit so suddenly?

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.230
Kasuhara-san?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.570
Dojima-san.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.130
Congrats. You're a fully-fledged assistant commander now.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.780
Not that...

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.160
You're quitting?

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.050
Oh, that.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.490
Will you...

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.250
lose your voice?

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.490
I guess he spilled the beans after all.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.940
Don't worry.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.940
If the procedure goes well, my vocal cords will remain intact.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.360
I'll regain the ability to speak with rehab as well.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.170
Then why? You have no reason to quit.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.800
We need more than just a voice to do our work, don't we?

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.820
I envisioned the moment

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:53.210
I, as a dispatcher, lost my voice and...

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.480
with it, the job I dedicated my life to.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.220
But...

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.420
if I quit beforehand, it might be easier to let go.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.830
Imagine the worst-case scenario and act before it occurs.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.240
Isn't it a fitting end for a dispatcher?

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.890
Besides, this place can function without me—

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.250
This isn't like you at all.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.020
Back then...

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.420
you told me we would be okay.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.980
Sir.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.400
I once called 119 when I was five years old.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.570
[119]

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:55.040
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.090
It's a fire.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.960
- Please save us.
- Got it.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.120
The one who answered my call back then was you.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.380
Although, I'm sure you don't remember it yourself.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.180
That was when...

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.790
you told me.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.630
- What do I do...
- Onee-chan!

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.360
What do I do?

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.510
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.160
Your sister can't move, right?

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.550
I'm scared. Please help us...

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.720
Don't worry. We’ll definitely rescue you.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.890
You'll definitely be okay.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.720
You said, "You'll definitely be okay."

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.720
- So listen to me, okay?
- Okay.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.280
Take a good look around you. Is there anything with water in it?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.250
Tea or juice would work, too.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:04.010
Maybe there's a bottle, a fish tank, a vase, or...

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.730
We have a vase.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.400
Okay, then take those flowers out.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.920
- I took them out.
- Good.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.350
- Now pour that water on your sister.
- What?

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.040
Now!

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.390
Run, you two!

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.200
Let's go!

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:28.590
I now understand how much courage it takes,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.280
as a dispatcher, to say, "You'll definitely be okay."

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.250
But you said it regardless.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.910
You gave me courage.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.680
That's why I'll say it, too.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.740
You'll be okay, Dojima-san.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.740
You'll definitely...

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.320
be able to come back here.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.280
You'll definitely be okay.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.980
Has the ambulance arrived?

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.460
Yes, the ambulance is here. Should I stay on the line?

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.420
You may hang up now.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.500
Please heed the paramedics' instructions when they arrive.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.160
- Hey there.
- Hello, Sir.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.390
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.250
My friend's flying a drone,

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.540
and I think he's lost control of it.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.340
Has it fallen and hurt someone?

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.330
No, it's still in the air.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.850
But its GPS appears to be malfunctioning.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.160
- Another GPS issue.
- I see.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.020
Unfortunately, we cannot do anything about that here.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.150
B-But it’s getting close to a highway.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.720
Which highway—

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.160
Is everything all right?

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.740
The drone fell onto the highway!

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.820
We can't retrieve it,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.700
but let’s get their contact info, location, and the time it fell.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.400
Do you know roughly where it fell and on which highway?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.480
It fell on the Yokohama-Yokosuka Road, around the Kariba Interchange.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.990
I hope no one's hurt.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.670
Could I get your name and contact information, just in case?

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.710
- Yes. My name is Ueda.
- "Ueda-san"?

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.840
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.170
There's been an accident.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.370
I hit the car in front of me on the highway because it suddenly stopped.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.790
When I got out of the car, I saw there was a string of accidents.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.770
From where and which highway are you calling?

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.870
I'm on the Yokohama-Yokosuka Road,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.460
just a little past the Kariba Interchange.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.180
- "Yokohama-Yokosuka Road, around the Kariba Interchange."
- Yes.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.090
Could that possibly be because of the drone?

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.960
Can you see a yellow number marking the side of the road?

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.770
Yes, it says 1.4.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.970
Then you are inbound at the 1.4-kilometer mark.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.980
And are you currently safe, Ma'am?

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.620
Yes, I'm standing on a pedestrian walkway.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.990
Please remain there

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.410
- and away from the highway.
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.130
Can you see how many cars were involved and their brands?

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.920
I'm not entirely sure, but there's a truck up front.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.170
Behind the truck, there's...

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.140
A string of accidents on a highway?

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.030
About six cars, I believe.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.930
- An accident involving a truck and six cars.
- Yes.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:46.360
Are you able to estimate how many individuals are injured?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.340
The second car seems squashed.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.520
I think people are stuck inside.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.050
Are the individuals in that car conscious?

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.020
I don't know.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.020
But the person in the driver's seat looks to be in pain!

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.160
I understand.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.710
I will send an ambulance and rescue squad your way.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.520
Lastly, may I get your name, Ma'am?

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.910
It's Nishiyama.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.300
[Emergency: Traffic accident]

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.540
[Emergency: Traffic accident]

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.580
