The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.820
Mother

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.370
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.630
Sorry, Mom

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.300
The patient was taken to the emergency room this morning

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.300
It seems to have stabilized a bit now.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.600
thank you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.330
Is it Ye-na?

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.330
Um

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.370
Where did you go yesterday

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.070
Go find mom

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.870
Is she doing well?

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.700
Same old thing

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.200
There's just a lot of weeds growing.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.350
Messy

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.730
Why did our mother live such a miserable life after her death?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.930
I miss my mom too.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.600
Ye-na

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.630
I first

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.930
Can't you just stay with your mother?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.400
Our mother

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.800
Haven't you been alone for too long?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.900
Alone

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.130
I went to accompany her

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'll do my best to serve you too.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.700
You just stay here

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.010
Stay here for a long time

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.830
long time

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.270
Just come to us again.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.270
Okay

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.150
sorry

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.200
I didn't know you were so sincere.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.800
I didn't know you would work so hard.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.470
Then do what you want.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.900
Go to your mother

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.450
Treat her well for me

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.000
Got it?

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.170
I went to see Dr. Yu

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.300
Thank you

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.360
Received the commission

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.170
I don't have any medicine right now, so I can't accept the commission.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.130
But the patient's condition is urgent.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.800
Who is the client?

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.030
It's my brother

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.760

-=Episode 8=-
Although the body was found in the lake

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.900
But there's no water in the lungs.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.670
It seems to have been processed after death

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.130
As you can see, the victim was shot.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.650
The cause of death was excessive bleeding from a gunshot wound.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.330
gunshot wound to the head

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.030
There are also traces of gunpowder and gas that can be observed.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.570
It appears to have been shot at close range.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.400
It is speculated that before he sank into the lake with his car

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.700
I've had cardiac arrest.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.570
Did the autopsy determine the type of gun?

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.600
The gun looks

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.100
It's a homemade gun

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.100
All the things I like

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.270
I want to eat as soon as I feel better

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.470
But recently I can't touch it at all

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.600
I want to stuff it into my mouth

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.030
Flowing with gravy

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.170
chewing meat

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.330
If I had known this earlier

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.170
When you are healthy, you should eat more

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.480
What a pity

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.800
It's also the food I like.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.570
Your food taste

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.600
Exactly the same as me.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.270
but

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.000
How could you give me such a thankful offer?

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.230
I heard that the medicine is not only hard to get

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.430
It is also not easy to handle

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.900
You are my benefactor

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.800
Didn't you help me and my brother a lot?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.470
I heard that your trip to Switzerland was ruined.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.070
I'm really, really sad.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.470
So I asked around.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.200
I didn't expect to get the medicine like this.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.470
Let's first confirm whether we can make people die painlessly.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.300
Conditions later

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.130
How to confirm that?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.430
Is it among your friends?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.930
Is there anyone willing to be a guinea pig and die?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.850
That's with my lawyer present.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.230
Give me the medicine

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.600
After I die peacefully

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.500
What has been agreed upon will be handled by my lawyer.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.900
Give it to your representative

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.900
How much amount do you want

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.670
Now in front of Representative Chen

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.170
Now on this occasion...

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.000
How much can you offer

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.150
Any amount is fine

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.770
You can take my money.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.600
You can also want my building

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.300
Just pick it.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.530
I'm going to die anyway.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.100
What else is there to be reluctant about?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.060
I just want

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.800
As long as I can die without pain

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.760
That's enough

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.430
-Is the practice going well?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.400
Hold on

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.530
Dr. Yu

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.960
Thank you for coming

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.330
I'm sorry.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.200
No medicine now

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.300
I'm not sure when it will be possible

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.250
Ah, it's okay.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.330
Ye Na also agreed

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.330
Doctor, you also promised to do it

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.400
Just wait a little longer and this pain will end

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.560
I feel much better when I think about it this way.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.430
Until then, Mr. Gun-soo

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.600
If there's something you want to do, do it.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.060
Then I...

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.000
While you're looking for medicine

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.800
Can I go on a trip with Ye-na?

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.230
Do you want to travel?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.900
Um

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.380
I want to go to Gangwon-do to see the sea

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.250
It might be painful, is that okay?

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.960
Ye-na, you're a great nurse. You'll take good care of him.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.360
Before going, go to Father Yang's hospital

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.930
I'll prepare what's needed.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.010
yes

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.860
thank you

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.600
-My Xiaosong is so cute today -Xiaosong Xiaosong

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.020
- It's fun. - Okay.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.460
-Hello. -Hello.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.400
-Hello. -Hello.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.260
What do you want to do today?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.600
Or where you want to go, just say

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.900
Uncle will do it for you.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.060
There

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.910
That...there

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.900
Let's go there

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.200
Don't worry here

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.060
Let's go on a trip with my brother.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.910
I'm sorry you're so busy and I have to leave alone.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.100
I will work harder when I come back

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.700
You're doing very well now.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.160
Always grateful to you

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.160
We'll see what happens here.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.060
Come back after having a good time with your brother.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.400
-Okay, thank you. -Thank you.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.930
Ah, come with me to the medical equipment shopping street later.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.660
The patient is running out of toilet pads and medicines

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.010
I forgot

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.000
At this moment, I was as happy as if I had seen the Lord.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.860
I have to go in and see what I need.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.600
I will go well

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.000
Please quickly take the basket and check the items.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.220
Okay, please go slowly.

-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.930
For you

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.820
You'll know when you look at the medicine.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.330
If Mr. Gun-soo's condition deteriorates

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360
If you have any questions, please call us anytime

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.000
Yes, thank you.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.930
I'm off

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.030
- Be careful on the road. - I'm leaving.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.310
Is this the place Xiaosong wants to go?

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.050
right

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.760
Komatsu

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.260
Wait until these are sold at a low price.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.460
Let's go home

-=Original Golden Crucian Carp Cake=-

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.460
- You're here. - I want two.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.910
There are two, right?

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.700
Please take your time

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.530
Xiaosong is here to get a blanket.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.700
Um

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.280
So you're going to wait here until your mother closes the stall?

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.140
Come

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.660
Can we take the blanket away?

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.240
-Okay. -Okay.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.140
Wow, so beautiful

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.520
Let's go

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.840
Is the child's mother no longer doing business?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.650
I left her here and didn't take her away for a long time.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.190
If you leave it here, you can either throw the cart away.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.960
She still owes money.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.030
A little secret

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.830
I'll pay for that.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.700
Fifty thousand won a month, right?

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.680
100,000 won per month

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.410
The price has increased

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.420
It's increased a lot.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.070
well

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.160
Please take care of the cart for a while.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.530
-Okay. -Okay.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.280
Xiaosong will play hide-and-seek with his uncle from now on.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.710
-Okay? -Okay

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.670
Be careful with your head

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.950
Driver, please take her to the place I told you.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.910
Okay, no problem.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.150
Xiaosong, you go first.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.290
You're such a torture, kid.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.950
I really want to beat you up

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.050
Let's go

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.280
Why don't you come with that little one?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.790
Wouldn't it be better to follow you wherever you go?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.510
There is a patient who must see Yu Suzhen

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.550
She had promised me before

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.790
She'll do anything as long as she can get something.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.240
I already gave her the stuff.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.490
What's the name of that little guy?

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.830
Her...her name is Xiaosong

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.860
Well, call her Xiaosong or Mushroom?

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.150
Do you think her mother's death was easy?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.340
Yu Suzhen is crazy and wants to choose her own patients

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.580
But that's ridiculous.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.200
If she refuses my order again,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.260
If she disobeys my orders again

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.830
I won't be able to do anything by then.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.030
So if you want to save your friend

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.030
What you should do

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.860
Convince her to bring her here.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, I...

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.280
No, no, wait a minute.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.440
represent

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.940
Let me try it

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:25.870
You?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.020
Who are you selling dog-skin plasters to?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.660
-Are you a doctor? -I'm talking to the representative about something important.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.310
You say it

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.400
yes

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.010
I was the first to talk about euthanasia.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.720
After my medical license was revoked

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.930
When my hands are so shaky that I can't have plastic surgery

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.080
That's when I started, so

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.870
I can try it

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.400
Can you really

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.050
-Are you sure? -Yes.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.290
But I need your help to keep me out of the sight of the police.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.200
I can't be like Yu Suzhen

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.710
It can't be detected in the autopsy report.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.160
But as long as you help stop the police

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.770
Knock knock knock Hello

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760
You little rascal

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.560
Are you happy watching the sea?

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.700
Yeah, happy

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.700
Where do you want to go next?

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.160
What else do you want to do?

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.310
I have something special I want to do

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:35.680
What?

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.460
Let's go see Dad.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.220
I miss him

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.940
Did you say you were coming to Gangwon Province just to see him?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.840
Doesn't dad live in a nursing home nearby?

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.020
I know he was trying to avoid loan sharks.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.060
I've lived here since last year.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.140
We finally made it here.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.050
Do you really have to see him?

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.780
I just want to reconcile all the things I feel guilty about.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.350
Leave with peace of mind

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.540
I know you feel uncomfortable

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.080
Come with me

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.240
After all, this is the last time, okay?

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.440
From there to here

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.310
Over there Over there

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.840
Collect them all

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.010
That that

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.860
And that and this

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.030
Bring me your leather shoes

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.490
Pack up all the leather shoes on the right

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.700
Tom Brady

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.170
This is the doctor who's here to help you.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.910
He used to be an excellent plastic surgeon.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.580
Now the good Samaritan

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.360
A kind of kind killer

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.030
Your task is simple

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.970
It is to let our representative Chen rest in peace without pain

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:27.220
And he is also a patient who meets the criteria set by Dr. Yu and you.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.770
Set a date as soon as the building transfer documents are ready

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.170
OK

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.660
I confirmed that the representative passed away peacefully without pain.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.900
The file will be given to you

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.110
If you die in pain

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.860
Then the contract is void.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.780
If he makes a sound of pain during the process

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.970
Or if there is a frown after death

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.160
There will definitely be no reward.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.360
There's no way to guarantee your safety.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.180
Don't worry, I won't tolerate it.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.450
This kind of thing happens

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.050
Are you coming to my doorstep to scare my family?

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.780
Have you forgotten that I'm going to sue you for stalking?

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.850
We found Kim Si-geon's body.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.470
The suspect is missing

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.740
So there are no more clues to find the criminal?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.180
Do you hope so?

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.020
So this is why you came to see me

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.580
Because the clues are gone.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.530
The guys who killed Jin Shijian

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.280
The next target might be you.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.960
Can police say this to a strong suspect?

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.350
Do you want me to confess out of fear?

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.500
Children may also be in danger

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.830
And I'm not here to investigate.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.760
Should we

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.980
Go home directly

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.080
Let's go to Gaocheng

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.040
To pay for nursing home medical expenses

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.690
I've seen him a few times.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.600
I don't want to make you uncomfortable by taking you to see him.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.230
That's why I object

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.650
Thanks

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.210
What are you doing?

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.400
Jin Shi saw that the owner of the car had already sneaked across the border.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.240
Let's close the case.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.020
Don't pretend to be trying too hard

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.280
Deliberately contacting Interpol to stir up trouble

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.030
I will close the case as soon as possible.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.940
Where are my things?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.500
I'll return it to you after the case is closed.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.030
I'm a busy man and I don't have time to wait

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.420
Hello

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.920
Hurry and get my things.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.870
Must get it by tonight

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:14.840
How much to take

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.120
The detective confirmed the scene.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.540
If you want too much, it will be difficult.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.570
Besides, a lot of them have already been taken out and disposed of in advance.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.490
In order to shut up the brothers under his command, he spent a lot of money.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.170
Very few left

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.000
You can use similar powder to impersonate

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.840
Put the real stuff on the top layer.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.030
Anyway, the evidence analysis is complete.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.560
Will not confirm again

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.710
If this problem can't be solved, then more than just layoffs will happen.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.420
We all have to die

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.040
yes

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.900
Being led by a gang of criminals

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.870
We must find a way as soon as possible

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.680
If we continue like this, we will be in danger.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.350
How are you doing?

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.690
Oh, you finally came.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.900
How long have I been here? Why are you only coming to see me now?

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.450
Ye-na should have told you that I'm here.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.600
I didn't tell him

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.360
He's sick and I don't want him to worry.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.120
Really can do it! Really can do it!

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.180
Your brother says he's sick every day.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.550
He is really sick.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.530
Really very sick

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.020
What are you shouting about?

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.280
Stinky girl

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.760
Are you guys here to mess around with me?

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.220
How much money?

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.260
Because you don't solve it

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.720
I'm not sick, but I'm still trying to avoid lending money.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.050
Living in captivity here

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.020
A guy who doesn't repent

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.230
Ye Na

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.410
It's okay. It's okay.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:20.010
sorry

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.380
I'm not in good health and can't make money.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.870
I am also receiving support from Ye-na

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.000
So I have no money for you

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.440
sorry

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.230
dad

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.320
What to do

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.260
I'm dying

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.130
Since you were little, the doctor told you that you wouldn't live long.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.410
Haven't you lived till now?

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.860
Stop talking nonsense.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.050
I'm really going to die

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.570
I probably won't make it through this month.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.910
That's why I came to see you

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:06.960
dad

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.660
I

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.260
I don't hate my father

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.310
Of course it has to be this way

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.990
After your mother passed away

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.860
I raised you all by myself and endured so much hardship.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.110
Thanks to me, you guys are grown up.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.240
You can't be ungrateful

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.960
I feel so sorry for you, Dad.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.760
What

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.710
I have a wish

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.790
It's my last wish before I die.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.240
You must promise me

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.610
What is

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.460
Please give Ye Na

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.240
Apologize

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.410
What

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.440
You want me to apologize to this girl?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.390
Yes

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.440
I don't hate you

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.010
You don't have to apologize to me.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.740
But you must apologize to Ye-na

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.640
Our Ye-na will have to live on her own from now on.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.240
She has to forgive her father.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.010
Use this power to survive

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.210
Always harboring resentment towards someone

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.360
It's impossible to live well

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.010
so

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.110
For Ye-na

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.210
Even now

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.410
Please apologize

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.590
You two crazy people

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.840
It's been a while since you last visited me. It's okay if you come empty-handed.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.410
What did you say?

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.090
- You bastards. - What's wrong?

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.490
Are you going to hit us again?

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.690
You stinky girl

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.990
Father

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.090
What to see

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.810
Sorry for yesterday

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.260
I suddenly felt like someone was following me

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.790
I sent Xiaosong over first.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.090
Who is following you? Is it a representative?

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.090
No, it's my illusion.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.960
But what happened? Where's Ye-na?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.790
We have to help Ye-na brother

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.260
Ye Na also agreed

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.260
Yeah

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.710
It's a blessing for Gun-soo.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.710
But the problem is that there is no Bafron

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:36.960
Can you get it?

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.310
Let me give it a try.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.440
I feel like I should be able to get it

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.840
You won't

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.360
I need to ask Representative Gu for help.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.110
We have to keep Gun-soo's matter a secret from CEO Gu.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.590
If he knew, he would charge Gun-soo a huge fee.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.390
Will make crazy demands again

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.410
When can you get the medicine?

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.390
Gun-soo is not in good condition

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.360
It should be done within a week or two.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.940
Wait till the specific date comes out.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.890
I'll contact you immediately

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.230
-=Number unknown=-

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.460
Suzhen, I have a call.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.940
I'll contact you later

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.910
Um

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.560
-Hello -Quack

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.010
Representative Gu asked me to call you

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.390
This Saturday

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.990
Where should I go?

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.610
I will send you the address

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.310
You prepare well

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.990
Feel sorry

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.240
It makes you feel worse.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.390
It doesn't matter

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.240
elder brother
Um

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.090
Last time the priest said

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.190
The people who truly love me are my family

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.360
Not related to blood

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.190
So,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.910
The brother you really want to see

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.460
People gather together like family

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.660
Let's have a party

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.640
Your band can sing

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.760
You can also eat delicious food. It's great.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.490
Do you want to have a funeral before you die?

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.840
Yes, the funeral was nice.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.090
I see this kind of ceremony also exists overseas. Let's do it too.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.410
I'll arrange it

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.490
Not bad, right?

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.390
Um

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.010
Don't worry about me

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.760
I will live a good life

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.390
Even if I don't get an apology from my father

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.840
I have such a great brother.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.260
How can I not live a good life?

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.460
So don't worry about me

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.860
Yes, you will live well.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.640
Um

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.990
- Let Ye-na hug us. - Forget it.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.240
- That's too much. - So corny.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.910
Do you plan to die on the day

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.010
Holding a funeral and concert?

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:40.510
Yes

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.940
I know that if there are too many people that day, it will cause a lot of inconvenience.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.510
But I really want to do it for my brother.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.810
He couldn't meet up with his friends often because of his illness.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.690
I want him to meet everyone one last time and say goodbye.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.790
Most of them are musicians

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.240
We can get together to sing and perform on stage

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.460
I think it's like a celebration

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.390
Ending after a happy play

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.910
Plenty of time

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.010
As long as you prepare well, it should be fine.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.560
You and your friends enjoy

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.890
When the time comes to end, we will help you

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.160
I'll probably get the medicine that evening.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:23.210
I'll bring the medicine by 7:00 on Saturday.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.490
Thanks

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.740
Then I'll book a performance venue nearby

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.840
Prepare the food and stage

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.690
Let's have fun creating a real celebration

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.910
Well, because it's a funeral ceremony.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.710
You can prepare spicy beef soup set

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.510
How's it? It's okay, right?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.110
The spicy beef soup set meal feels very sad.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.440
I'll prepare anything you want to eat.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.010
Don't worry about the preparation

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.310
Gun-soo, just prepare for the performance.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.190
Thanks

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.840
-=Notice=-

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.670
I don't want to cry today

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:54.700
I will do my best to let my brother leave happily.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.150
good

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.370
Qihong took off his hat

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.770
Don't take it off

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.420
Bro, your friend is here.
Who is

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:11.720
Hello, Painter Cui

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.400
Come here, you

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.270
If it wasn't a funeral, you wouldn't have come, would you?

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.300
How can you say that?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.550
Today we will have a band performance and have fun

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.920
Just enjoy it.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.400
OK, so I'll take this in lieu of condolence money.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:28.550
I drew a portrait of you

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.250
Exactly the same

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.470
You finally managed to describe my beauty

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.270
It's great to see you while you're still alive.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.850
Yeah, really.

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.020
Is this Zhenshuo?

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.270
Are you Zhenshuo?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.920
Hello, how long have we not seen each other?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920
I brought my guitar too.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.420
Are you going to sing for me?

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.820
Well, I'll sing you your favorite song.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.320
Okay, we'll also perform.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.050
Not just us, if you guys want to sing too

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.400
Come on stage and sing anytime.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.620
I really need to listen to a few more songs today, you know?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.000
marvelous

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.920
-Thank you. -See you later.
You guys can sit anywhere.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.670
-Okay. -Go ahead.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.400
It's nice to have a funeral before you die.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.970
Before leaving

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.800
See the people you miss

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.520
Share delicious food together

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.100
Everyone will feel lucky to see you one last time.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.270
yes

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.470
When I leave, there will be a funeral where everyone gathers together and cries.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.970
I don't think it's good when I think about it

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.800
Come to you

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800
The spicy beef soup you want

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.200
The man who ate spicy beef soup at his own funeral

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.720
It's just me.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.950
- Eat slowly. - Okay.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.470
- How's it? - It's salty.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.770
Is it salty?

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.150
I feel like adding some more water

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.320
This is what I expected in the end

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.770
In pain

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.970
Lost in a state of consciousness due to painkillers

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.020
Then say goodbye to your loved ones

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:09.500
It's meaningless.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.770
yes

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.300
Everyone has their own way of saying goodbye.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.420
It's so tragic to die in the hospital.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.470
But not yet

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.600
Too dangerous

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.570
Represents the madman

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.000
Maybe he'll be watching somewhere.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.250
I see

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.000
I don't want to be involved with that person.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.920
Ye Na

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.970
Your father is here

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.620
How come you are here?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.020
I have something to tell you

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.100
I heard that Gun-soo is dying.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.950
He's leaving. It's over.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.870
I as a father

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:55.970
I have to say this to you one last time.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.000
I'm sorry.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.070
At that time

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.450
My situation is also difficult

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.600
You have to be raised by someone.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.120
Feeling very tired

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.690
No more words

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.510
sorry

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.720
You should apologize to Ye-na.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.300
sorry

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.430
sorry

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.910
sorry

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.620
Thank you, Dad.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.230
Thank you, Dad. Thank you.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.390
Thank you, Dad.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.570
sorry

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.290
Thank you, Dad.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.310
Ouch

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.720
The money is quite thick

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.010
Wow, you are such a filial girl.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.420
Thanks

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.810
You have to be careful

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:05.030
The loan shark should still be looking for you.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.400
I'll figure it out myself.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:07.600
but

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.980
Is Gun-soo really going to die?

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.190
right

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.570
Ah, this kid is so young.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.030
Who does he look like? He's so weak.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.990
Please go

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:27.980
that

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.800
Ye Na

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.740
Although I shouldn't say this after I've received your money...

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.560
sorry

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.500
You said it

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.430
What we should do

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.430
Let the one you love

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.840
Leave without worries

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.490
Untouchable Clouds

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.330
Inaudible

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.700
Trapped in darkness

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.970
Invisible

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:51.830
Can be felt but cannot be touched

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:58.260
I will set out to find you

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.970
By the broken moonlight

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:09.380
If you can illuminate me brightly

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:15.610
No matter when I will always

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:21.590
Light up the light for you

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.110
I'll go get the medicine.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.570
- Be careful. - Okay.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.210
I'm outside now...

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.870
Tell me the location, I'll go there now

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.420
Don't be nervous

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.420
I'll use this time to repay

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.530
Suzhen is in debt to Li Yunxi

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.450
And I have to leave as soon as this is over.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.260
I left midway. Leaving for too long would arouse suspicion.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.250
Starting from today, we must do it decisively.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.380
Also, do you still remember?

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.690
If this person is in even the slightest bit of pain, you'll...

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.960
Don't make mistakes

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.150
-=3.Contract Party Personnel Information Chen Yingxiu=-

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.750
-=Registration Obligor: Chen Yingxiu Registration Rights Holder: Guguang Asset Operations=-

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.140
no

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:34.880
We personally confirmed it and brought it over.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.300
-=Evidence Storage Room=-

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.160
How could it disappear?

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.080
I also thought it must be here, so I asked the Narcotics Bureau.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.930
Among the seven kilograms of seized goods, there was no Pavlon from the beginning.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.040
Why is there no Bafron?

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.010
What are you talking about? We clearly saw the Pavlon bottle with our own eyes.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.030
And how could it be seven kilograms?

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:50.000
At first glance, it looks like a lot. How can it be seven kilograms?

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.960
Two people who were caught by customs not long ago

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.140
Hidden on the body is seven kilograms

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.220
But if the truck also carries seven kilograms,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.550
That's outrageous.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.680
Someone must have taken it from inside.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.450
It must have been swapped in a blind spot.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.340
Or it was taken away when the surveillance was closed.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.400
I'm speechless.

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.710
No, the investigation wasn't even finished yet. They took it away early.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:13.120
Is it too courageous or crazy?

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.500
A courageous madman.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.590
I don't know who it is, but this needs to be monitored.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.590
Should I report this to Captain An?

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:19.330
No

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.330
It's not clear who is involved in this matter.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.470
Whatever was taken from here must have been sold on the market.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.120
Find something through a drug dealer you know

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.900
Then we can pursue him in the opposite direction.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.960
Even though I stuffed it into my mouth like crazy

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.090
But I still can't feel any taste

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.270
I don't know if it's because of the illness or the medicine.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.190
Everything I eat tastes bitter

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.320
Have you said goodbye to your family?

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.900
Now this time

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.950
My wife must be arguing with my mother

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:50.140
Arguing over who gets more inheritance

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.660
I didn't even know I was going to die

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.360
No one will feel sad because of me

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.860
You can fight with confidence

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.650
Huh

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.160
The location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle has been found.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.970
Detective Li has found the location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle 37A9781 that you requested. I'll send you the address: 9-11, Lao Liudong, Wancheng District, Basin City, Basin City Outer Ring Road.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:35.720
Where

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.370
It is said that it is in the outer ring of Basin City

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.220
There are many villa hotels here.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.340
Send me the location

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:42.970
good

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.860
Damn

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.910
I will contact his family immediately.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.720
I'm leaving too.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:26.940
Wait a moment

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.560
It's just the beginning. You just have to do what I say.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.540
Don't do useless things

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.720
Choi Dae-hyun

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.650
Wake up, okay?

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.460
certainly

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:52.400
Organize

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.420
Oh, our representative Chen

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.450
Oh, you need to go peacefully.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.440
It would be very heavy to carry all this.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.660
Ah now

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.320
Please welcome today's protagonist

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.850
Also the lead singer of ROUNDERS

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.280
Our dear

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.750
Choi Gun-soo performs on stage

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.380
Ah, thank you all for waiting for me.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.720
yes

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:33.400
Um, today

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.070
I really appreciate everyone staying with me.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.940
The song I'm about to sing is

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.560
It's a song I really like.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.890
As our last greeting

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.160
I think this song is very appropriate

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.060
I today

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.700
Because of everyone's company

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.470
Feel very happy

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.210
I hope everyone can be happy

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.130
Hope we

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.430
In the distant future

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:07.660
In a beautiful place

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.790
Reunion

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.500
I'll unplug this first.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.260
It's okay. It's okay.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.540
Oh, very good

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.140
No matter how hard I try to forget

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.800
Can't forget that face

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.250
No matter how hard you try to erase it

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.700
Can't erase that name

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.160
Sing with oxygen

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.500
Ye Na

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:45.440
Let's sing together

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:07.850
In the sad back of me turning around

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.830
I can still feel you sobbing

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:23.230
If I could meet you again in the distant future

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:29.360
I must say I loved you

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.600
Sometimes loneliness strikes

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.020
Sometimes regrets come

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.800
One day as time goes by

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.220
I can't help but cry alone

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.190
elder brother

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.160
Because I can't bear to leave

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:32.340
You sobbing in my arms

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.590
Treasure deep in my heart

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.960
The only thing left is what I've always wanted to tell you

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:51.720
That sentence

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.960
-Brother -Yeah

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.660
us

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.560
See you later

00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.280
Later?

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.830
Later

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:01.770
after

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.460
After a long, long time

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:07.880
Got it?

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.360
See you then

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.180
Thank you

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:19.160
In the sad back of me turning around

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.860
I can still feel you sobbing

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.850
Someone once said

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:28.910
People are like

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.930
Prepare for winter

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.980
Prepare to die

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.610
Because you know winter will come.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.930
What about me

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.220
I'm really happy to make this choice now.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:56.320
I can still feel you sobbing

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.860
Thank you, brother

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.780
Thanks to you

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.960
I got an apology from my dad.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.880
I will work harder and live a good life.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.710
Ye Na

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:14.930
You have to live a good life

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.740
I'm so sleepy

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:49.860
Very sleepy

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.840
elder brother

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.160
elder brother

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:27.620
If I could meet you again in the distant future

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:42.290
I must say I loved you

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.330
This is the last record left by the patient.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.740
Everyone can take pictures, just say whatever you want.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.640
here we go

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.140
Choi Ye-na

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.030
ah

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400
I'll do it myself

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.410
Why

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.910
Ah, I can relax a little by myself.

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:05.980
I'll be shy. Let's go.

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.940
Ah, I can't leave you alone.

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.860
Ah, let's go, hurry up

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.330
Let's go

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:12.150
Let's go

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.280
Go! Go!

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.760
- I'm going to throw it away. - I'm going to watch you record it here.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.690
A little further

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.840
Choi Ye-na

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.720
Forehead

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:41.460
I really have to say it

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.300
I don't know what to say

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:49.450
Who are you

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.520
Same day as me

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.480
Born at the same time

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.940
Twins

00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.980
Is that because of this?

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.400
Since childhood

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.040
Before you say

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.290
You already know what I'm thinking.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.450
You know it now, right?

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.450
ah

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.340
Ye Na

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.780
My brother

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.700
I have been feeling unwell since childhood

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.660
I haven't done anything for you. I'm sorry.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.130
Forgive me

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.770
Who are you

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.620
My World

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.300
Ye Na

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.480
As usual

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.710
You have to be strong

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.940
Live handsomely

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.540
I will be in heaven with my mother

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.770
Looking at your

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:40.600
ah

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.250
I love you

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:48.960
Thank you

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.600
My other half

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.040
Choi Ye-na

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.940
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.400
I want to give you a suggestion

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.100
I can give you more money this time.

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.360
Please let me die. Please.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.570
Please free me from this pain

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:37.380
Why is that?

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.100
If you want to kill someone, kill me.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.060
How could I kill you?

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.340
You are so good at using Baflon

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.990
Let me see the police

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:45.460
Do you know Chen Yingxiu?

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.320
Where were you when Chen Yingxiu died?

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.420
Choi Dae-hyun, you said that, right?

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.100
Because you deceived me

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.820
This is what happened because of misconduct
