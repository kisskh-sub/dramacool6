00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.140
Ye Chenyuan.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.140
What's wrong?

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:47.019
Ye Chenyuan.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.099
It's nothing.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.459
Just some minor injuries.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.459
Not fatal.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.459
Come here.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.259
It seems some people don't want me dead.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:17.536
You're overthinking it.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.460
You killed my mother,

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.539
and just injured my master.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.419
I'll settle

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.300
all these debts of blood.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.060
You don't get to die that easily.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.740
Let slide other things.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.740
But earlier, your master

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.060
clearly intended to kill you.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.099
If it weren't for me,

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.580
you'd have died by his sword.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.639
In their eyes,

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.759
I've long betrayed Nine Heavens

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.639
and colluded with you.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.159
My master wanting me dead

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.960
is only natural.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.560
Besides, he showed mercy just now.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.960
If he hadn't pretended to lose

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.159
and let us escape,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.479
you couldn't have fled.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280
Seems people from Nine Heavens

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.319
have no hearts.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.960
Since that's the case,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.520
I don't need to hold back
against you, either.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:32.560
Ye Chenyuan.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.919
Ye Chenyuan.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.759
Ye Chenyuan!

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.599
Not killing you now

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.159
is my last act of mercy.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.360
Stay here and fend for yourself.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.199
Almost forgot about this.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.400
If not for the Soul-Binding Rope,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.848
I wouldn't have saved you.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.160
Not killing him is one thing,

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.480
but why save him?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.399
Even if he once saved my life,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.379
that can't compare to matricide.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.660
Bai Yixi...

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.339
(Who's Bai Yixi?)

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.579
(His beloved?)

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.759
Never mind.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.680
I never exploit vulnerabilities.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.199
When you recover,

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.360
I'll run you through myself.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.560
Yixi...

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.759
It's been three days.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.800
Still got no trace
of the traitor Bai Xiaoying.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.480
Send more troops.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Eliminate Bai Xiaoying swiftly
and retrieve the Divine Sword.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.480
Otherwise, we'll face
endless consequences.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.199
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.600
My lord,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.279
I know Bai Xiaoying well.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.879
She'd never covet power

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.720
or betray our sect.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.519
Yunya.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.920
The evidence is right before you.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.959
Irrefutable proof exists.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.800
Yet you keep defending that traitor.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.959
What's your game?

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.000
Yunya.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.279
Do your words do justice to our sect

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360
or the Immortal Lord?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.920
Immortal Xiyuan speaks truth.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.480
We mustn't spare
that traitor Bai Xiaoying.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.279
My lord, please make your judgment.

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.319
- Please make your judgment.
- Please make your judgment.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.040
My lord,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.199
Bai Xiaoying is my disciple.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.839
She committed grave errors.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.839
I should bring her back myself

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.519
and investigate the whole truth.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.759
If I fail to bring her back,

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.680
I'm willing

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:12.920
to share her punishment.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.040
- Wait. Share the punishment?
- Yunya, you...

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.439
Share?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.040
I never realized
you trusted your disciple so.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.959
Very well.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:33.040
Retrieve Bai Xiaoying
and the Divine Sword quickly.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.079
Give the immortal sect proper closure.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.240
Understood.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.680
Seems fate favors you.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.759
You didn't perish here.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.079
Apparently, someone wants me alive.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.040
I shouldn't disappoint such kindness.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.160
Fine.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.839
Then keep living well

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.160
and entrust me your life.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.360
Seems I needn't do it myself.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:22.699
Three-soul departing

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:24.819
is no minor injury.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.740
I must return to the Night Clan

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.660
to mend my fractured soul
with the Coldwood Origin Stone.

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:32.032
Then I'll fully recover.

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:34.848
We're setting off now.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:35.980
We?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.540
I'm not going.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.699
I belong to Nine Heavens.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.300
How could I go with you?

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.139
To turn myself in?

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:46.660
Nine Heavens?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.420
In their eyes,

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:51.259
you're no longer part of Nine Heavens.

00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:56.928
Night Clan has the sword crystal
needed to awaken the Divine Sword.

00:07:58.304 --> 00:08:00.720
Don't you want to sever
the Soul-Binding Rope and kill me?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:03.459
Are you going

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480
or not?

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:16.139
All around are immortal sect's disciples
sent to hunt you.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.259
Why not go faster?

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:19.296
I taught you for nothing.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.980
You weren't the only one
injured in the battle.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.980
Be grateful I didn't abandon you.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.540
Complain again,

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:28.819
and we'll split up.

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:31.616
You take your Night Clan path,
and I'll take my own path.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.379
Don't forget,
the Soul-Binding Rope still exists.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.940
So annoying!

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:43.340
A mighty Divine Sword

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.419
needs some sword crystal
to cut this Soul-Binding Rope?

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:47.179
Of course.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.980
An unawakened Divine Sword

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:50.820
is just useless scrap metal.

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:57.419
Aren't these Night Clan people?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.460
Warn me next time!

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:16.820
You act without asking all the time.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.179
Whatever!

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:25.820
Aren't those Night Clan people?

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:27.019
Why hide from them?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.139
Afraid they'll see you like this?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.779
When I left,

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:33.259
I entrusted Jiaotu with leadership.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.860
These people don't seem to serve Jiaotu.

00:09:39.168 --> 00:09:40.576
The Night Clan may be in turmoil.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.080
- Greetings, my lord.
- Greetings, my lord.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.720
Remember.

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:10.340
Reveal my injury to no one.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.740
Or we won't leave alive.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.340
The mighty Night Deity fears death?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.980
Sorry.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.679
Even if I die,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.360
I'll kill you first.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.039
- Greetings, my lord.
- Greetings, my lord.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:31.919
Where's Jiaotu?

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:32.759
Summon him.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.120
Lord Jiaotu

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.639
is no longer here.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.120
What?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.799
My lord,

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:40.559
is it truly you?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.519
I've searched everywhere for you

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.039
without any trace.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.200
I thought you've...

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.440
How could the useless
immortal sect harm me?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.899
I'm relieved you're safe.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:55.620
We welcome your return, my lord.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.419
You're injured after all,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.659
and bring an immortal sect member back.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.379
Intriguing.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.700
You endanger the Night Clan,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.740
so I have to rebel.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.620
Rumors across realms say

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.392
you stayed in the Immortal Realm,

00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:33.539
colluded with a low-ranking disciple,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.620
helped her get the Divine Sword,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.460
and took wounds for her.

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:41.980
I dismissed them as lies.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.779
Turns out they're true.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.899
Severely injured,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.820
yet you dare bring an enemy
into the Demon Heart Hall?

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:51.539
You've abandoned the Night Clan.

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:53.620
Since that's the case,

00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:58.899
the title of Night Deity
shall change hands.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.820
The janitor disciple there,

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.100
surrender the Divine Sword.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.059
I'd love to,

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.720
but my injuries

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.039
have drained my power.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.399
I can't summon it.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.279
Then rest in the dungeon.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720
Stay there

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.200
until you summon the Devine Sword.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:26.360
Fine.

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:36.940
(These scrolls record
ancient formations.)

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.200
(Only by finding the formation
the elders used that day)

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.759
(can I clear Xiaoying's name
and help her return to Nine Heavens.)

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.519
(This is it!)

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.039
(Just as I suspected.)

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.419
You must have a backup plan.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.299
With your paranoid nature,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.659
you wouldn't come

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.340
to the Night Clan unprepared.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:17.019
Whisper to me.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.740
What's your real plan?

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.860
You are my backup plan.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.179
What kind of backup plan is this?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.460
The time has come.

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:43.019
My lord,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.139
sorry, I'm late.

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:48.220
So this is the Jiaotu who escaped?

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.899
As you predicted,

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.899
Hua Yuying indeed plotted rebellion.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.740
We've laid ambushes in advance

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.460
and retaken the Demon Heart Hall.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:00.980
Where has she gone?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.379
She took the Coldwood Origin Stone

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:05.280
and retreated
to the Sword Crystal Sanctuary.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.019
My lord.

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:10.220
- My lord, are you alright?
- Ye Chenyuan.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.799
Are you alright?

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:21.100
This hot spring truly
lives up to its legend.

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:23.659
It nourishes the body

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.460
and heals wounds?

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:26.539
My lord,

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:27.700
you're badly injured.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.940
I'll retrieve the Coldwood Origin Stone
for you.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.179
If we use force,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.460
there must be many people dead.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.340
I have my ways.

00:14:37.539 --> 00:14:38.080
Leave now.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:40.704
Understood.

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.220
I never thought the Night Deity
who treats all beings as grass

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.139
would actually care for his people.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.659
Of course.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.419
Unlike your immortal sect

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.820
and your master

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.779
who shows no mercy

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.379
to his own disciples.

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:02.259
My master isn't like that!

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:14.740
Give it back to me.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:15.860
You...

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.100
I knew you lacked the skill
to take it back.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.080
Ouch!

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:26.912
What's wrong?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:29.860
Ye Chenyuan,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.860
you don't like me, do you?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.340
I've noticed

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.700
all these wounds on your body

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460
were taken for my sake.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.019
Would I fancy someone as foolish as you?

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.019
Stop flattering yourself.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.379
Good to hear.

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:51.980
Don't forget

00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:54.299
I'm supposed to kill you.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.820
I'm vulnerable now.

00:15:58.259 --> 00:15:59.100
Why don't you strike?

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:04.299
Well...

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.580
That's because...

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.620
Am I your enemy

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:10.860
or is this just

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.220
empty talk about wanting me dead?

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.860
In truth...

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:16.288
Stop deluding yourself.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.340
It's merely

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.299
our instinct to save lives.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:21.728
Give me back the Clear Spirit Ring.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.659
Just a bracelet.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.139
Why the obsession?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.299
That's none of your concern.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.299
Aren't you overstepping?

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.299
It concerns me directly.

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:33.539
This belongs to the Nine Heavens.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:35.700
If someone contacts you

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.059
to harm the Night Clan,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.019
what should I do?

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:41.019
This ring

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740
stays with me for now.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.740
Are you mocking me?

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:47.139
You must return it today!

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:49.500
Hand it over!

00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:52.779
You dare come?

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.779
You can't get in!

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.539
No need for violence.

00:16:58.179 --> 00:17:00.379
I come to discuss important matters.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.819
Instead of pursuing her,
she comes to you.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.059
You're here to seize
the Demon Heart Hall, right?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.940
How could it be?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.220
We're evenly matched now.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.259
If we fight to the death,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.619
both sides lose.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.259
Moreover, I realize

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.420
that I've long admired you.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.460
Now's our chance
to rebuild the Night Clan together,

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:31.420
a powerful alliance.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.940
So I came

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:34.859
to propose

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.460
a marriage.

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:37.819
- What?
- What?

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:38.460
What?

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.700
Why so shocked?

00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:42.059
I'm being completely serious.

00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:45.664
What right do you have
to propose marriage?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.660
Aren't you afraid
I'll make this your final journey?

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:57.259
I know what you want.

00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:00.140
But if I don't return,

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:02.099
the Coldwood Origin Stone

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:04.579
and Sword Crystal Sanctuary
will self-destruct.

00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:09.220
Do I qualify for negotiations now?

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:10.740
It seems

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:13.339
you've thought it through.

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:14.099
Of course.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.279
I

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240
refuse.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.960
What makes you confident to refuse me?

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.359
(She has the sword crystal.)

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.680
(If I can just obtain it,)

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.792
(I can unseal the Divine Sword
and kill him.)

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I'd refuse too.

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:31.160
Such meager benefits won't do.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.200
Unless you hand over the sword crystal.

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:36.200
Then we might consider it.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.079
You're rejecting me because of her?

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:46.000
Here's the thing.

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:49.039
We're connected by a Soul-Binding Rope.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.279
Only by wielding
the Divine Sword together

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:51.960
can we sever it.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:53.760
As long as this exists,

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:55.720
even if you marry,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.319
whether you're eating

00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:58.359
or sleeping,

00:18:58.839 --> 00:19:00.000
I'll have to be present.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.160
That would be rather awkward, right?

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.000
So you want it yourself.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.440
Yeah.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:08.119
Don't worry.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.400
Give me some time.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.480
I'll make Ye Chenyuan agree.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.759
Bai Xiaoying!

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.920
I'll give you three days.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:14.960
After three days,

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.279
if he doesn't marry me,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.240
you'll all regret it.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.400
Don't even think about it.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.279
Three days it is. Deal.

00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:21.720
Waiting for the good news.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.519
Explain yourself.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:41.859
Explain what?

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.900
She's beautiful

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:45.660
and powerful.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.759
She can help restore your powers

00:19:48.832 --> 00:19:50.112
and give me the sword crystal.

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:53.059
I can't think of any reason to refuse.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:58.640
Bai Xiaoying,

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:00.500
who do you think I am?

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.460
You're hurting me.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.619
I won't get married for alliance,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.500
and will never be a bargaining chip
for someone like you.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:09.640
Someone like me?

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:11.460
Don't forget.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.099
You are my enemy.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.660
What if I use you as a bargaining chip?

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.140
Moreover,

00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:20.220
you told me yourself

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.176
only the Night Clan
has the sword crystal.

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:23.299
That's why I came.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.579
I haven't killed you

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.700
because you saved me once.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.299
I always repay debts clearly.

00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:34.819
Is that all?

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:42.539
For a moment, I once hoped

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:46.019
you hadn't killed my mother

00:20:48.579 --> 00:20:51.140
and weren't the Night Deity
who takes lives wantonly.

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:06.740
Stuck together when we fight.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.539
So annoying!

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.859
What's wrong?

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.299
Are you okay?

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:15.380
This isn't because of our fight, is it?

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.859
I just...

00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:20.448
haven't fully recovered.

00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:22.660
So agree to Hua Yuying's terms now.

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:25.099
Alright, I'll stop.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.539
The hot springs first.

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:26.940
Let's go.

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:30.299
I'll say this upfront.

00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:31.900
My revival art is mediocre.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.940
We can only try a long shot.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.500
(His soul damage is alarmingly severe.)

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.380
(This is practically incurable.)

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.619
This is Night Clan's tonic.

00:21:56.859 --> 00:21:57.819
Feed him some.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.299
Me feed him?

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:03.819
Look at his condition.

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:05.099
He can't eat by himself.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.000
Someone needs to chew it
and feed it mouth-to-mouth.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.380
If not you, should I?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.900
It's better if I don't do it.

That's not what I meant.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.180
I wanted to retrieve the sword crystal.

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:27.059
The sword crystal,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.600
I can help you get it.

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:17.700

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:20.299

00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:41.312
Don't you know he's still badly hurt?

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:46.160
Who would have thought Ye Chenyuan,

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:47.960
the mighty one,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.480
would be delivered to my bed

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.079
by the one he trusted most.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:54.720
Good.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.680
Ye Chenyuan,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.039
you're mine now.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.039
Wait.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.119
Give me the sword crystal.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.880
After I sever the Soul-Binding Rope,
he'll be yours.

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:06.599
Fine.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.200
But first, let me examine him properly.

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:25.200
Bai Xiaoying,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
how dare you deceive me!

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:28.200
I didn't.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.720
Give me the Coldwood Origin Stone,

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.680
or you're dead.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.759
I told you before.

00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:39.400
I've cast a spell.

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:41.240
If I die,

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:43.279
both the Coldwood Origin Stone

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.960
and Sword Crystal Sanctuary
will self-destruct.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.059
Then I'll spare your life.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.140
I'll take it myself.

00:26:57.839 --> 00:26:58.619
Ye Chenyuan,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.380
I won't accept this.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:01.980
Twenty years ago,

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.220
you came

00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:05.779
and led us to attack the immortal sect
for the sword crystal.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.819
Then you secluded yourself for 20 years.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.420
During these two decades,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.980
Jiaotu and I managed the Night Clan.

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:12.900
Now,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.039
you've lost 90% of your cultivation.

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.980
You're unworthy of being Night Deity.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.700
Wait.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.740
He secluded himself for 20 years?

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:26.380
Then ten years ago,

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.019
was he also in seclusion?

00:27:28.299 --> 00:27:28.980
How dare you!

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:30.500
Jiaotu,

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:32.220
for 20 years,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.900
we've worked tirelessly
for the Night Clan.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.420
Now that he's powerless,

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.819
will you still obey him?

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:42.272
He is the Night Deity.

00:27:42.819 --> 00:27:44.660
I only respect the Night Deity.

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:47.460
But he may not be.

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:49.779
How could the true Night Deity
be so easily harmed?

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:52.019
Our Night Clan's treasure,
the Demon-Identifying Seal,

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:53.700
can verify the true Night Deity.

00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:55.779
Let's summon it to test

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.339
whether Ye Chenyuan

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.259
is the true Night Deity.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.759
Seems the Seal doesn't recognize you.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.720
Then you're not the Night Deity.

00:28:46.319 --> 00:28:46.920
Jiaotu,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.359
did you see that?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.720
What are you waiting for?

00:28:58.079 --> 00:28:58.848
Are you alright?

00:28:59.359 --> 00:28:59.720
Hurry!

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.839
Before Hua Yuying arrives,

00:29:02.496 --> 00:29:03.680
sever the Soul-Binding Rope.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.480
What do you mean?

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.960
I'm fulfilling your wish.

00:29:20.448 --> 00:29:22.336
She said you had been
in seclusion for 20 years.

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:23.859
Is that true?

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.808
So at the Lantern Festival
ten years ago,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.980
you never went to Su City,

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:31.940
nor killed my mother.

00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:34.380
Why took false credit?

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:35.660
Why didn't you tell me?

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.660
So what if I did?
And so what if I didn't?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.900
The world has accused me
of countless crimes.

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:42.220
I care none for them.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.180
But you're not the Night Deity!

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.059
Who says I'm not?

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.568
Sever the Soul-Binding Rope.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.140
I'll marry Hua Yuying.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.140
Why?

00:29:52.539 --> 00:29:53.420
She's beautiful,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.859
and powerful.

00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:57.980
She can help restore my powers
and reclaim the Night Clan.

00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:00.019
Didn't you say it yourself?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.059
I can't think of any reason

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.579
why I shouldn't marry her.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.900
But you don't want it.

00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:06.819
You don't love her.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.019
Now I want it.

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:13.220
Ye Chenyuan, don't be like this.

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:14.859
What concern is this of yours?

00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.019
But I don't want you to marry her.

00:30:19.019 --> 00:30:19.460
Why?

00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:22.259
Why don't you want me to marry her?

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.460
Because...

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.519
Let's consider this carefully.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:41.839
Is that all?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.880
Besides, without the sword crystal,

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.656
we can't sever
the Soul-Binding Rope now.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.759
Let's retrieve the sword crystal first.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.480
We can do it.
