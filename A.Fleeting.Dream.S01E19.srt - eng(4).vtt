00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.920
Jin Se!

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.680
Come on, let's get to the hospital.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.800
Xueshan...

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.680
The Japanese...

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.760
Don't say a word.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.159
Save our strength.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.360
Let's go to the hospital first.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:29.559
Jin Se!

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.119
Jin Se!

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.880
Jin Se, wake up!

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.480
Jin Se!

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.038
We'll be at the hospital soon.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.879
Hang in there a little longer.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.319
Jin Se!

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.359
Jin Se!

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:04.639
You haven't slept all night.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.479
Get some rest.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.159
This hairpin...

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.799
I gave it to Jin Se
before I came to Hu City.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
She's worn it ever since.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.519
Back then, her family
sold her overseas to pan for gold.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.320
She risked her life to escape.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.600
Later, you saved her.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.919
All these years, you lived together.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.200
You trained together.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.680
She saw you as her master.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.159
But you treated her like family.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.959
I was wrong.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.839
I never should have
dragged her into danger.

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.159
This isn't your fault.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.000
You gave her a choice.

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.919
She wanted
to stay by your side and help.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.079
Because in her heart,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.360
you were her only family too.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.480
It was Pei Xueshan.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.760
Pei Xueshan is the one who killed her.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.320
I know.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.278
You want justice for her.

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.119
But we don't have any proof.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't worry.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.400
I'll help you.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.679
Xinruo.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.080
Why are you smiling?

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.079
Don't smile. Stop!

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:44.838
Lian Xinruo!

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.919
Stop smiling! Stop it!

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.200
How dare you mock me?

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.999
Why are you still smiling?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.800
Stop! How dare you!

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.160
Lian Xinruo!

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.118
Jin Se was killed in broad daylight?

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.919
Yes.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.038
Who killed her?

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:26.919
We don't know.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.560
That person struck in the crowd
and disappeared.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:31.959
You may go.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.880
Yes.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.278
(Xinruo has always thought
I captured Jin Se.)

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.798
(Will she lay this hatred)

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.319
(on me too?)

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.880
Xueshan, what's wrong?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.340
(Pei Residence)

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:36.679
This wound is deep.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.400
If it isn't treated properly,
it will leave a scar.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.840
Doctor, is there no other way?

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.838
I'm not sure.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.639
Mr. Jiang, why don't you
take her abroad for treatment?

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.279
I understand.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.680
Lian Xinruo!

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.159
It must be her.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.518
It must be that wretch.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.119
Xueshan, calm down. Take a breath.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.518
No one entered your room last night.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:07.118
Besides, Xinruo has no feud with you.

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:08.719
She has no reason to do this.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.480
Leave me be.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.120
I want to be alone.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
I'll check on you later.

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:31.038
That strike was vicious.

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.999
Did Miss Xueshan offend someone?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.038
Miss Xueshan is always so gentle.

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.118
She has a kind heart.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.518
Who would she offend?

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.439
Don't you think Miss Xueshan
seemed terrifying just now?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.519
She was raving.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.239
That's nothing like her usual self.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.980
(Three days later)

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.639
That's wonderful, Miss.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.920
With the makeup on,
the scar looks lighter.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.560
What a relief.

00:08:51.319 --> 00:08:53.559
I heard you
had a nightmare the other night

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.120
and scratched your face.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.919
I came back to see you.

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:00.079
Why are you glaring at me?

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:01.399
Keep glaring at me,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.079
and your face still won't heal.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.920
Lian Xinruo, curse you!

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.879
Why drop the act now?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.119
Pei Xueshan, I'm warning you.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.040
For everything you've done to Yuze,

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:13.719
I'll make you pay double.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.358
Lian Xinruo!

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:18.279
You want the antidote, don't you?

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:19.158
The truth is,

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.318
there is no antidote.

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:22.278
This poison can't be cured.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:26.319
You can only watch
as Pei Yuze rots from the inside out.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.159
Pei Xueshan, this is your true color.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.039
Disgusting.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:52.839
Lian Xinruo, I'll destroy you!

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.679
Lian Xinruo!

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.440
Lian Xinruo!

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080
Xinruo, wait!

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:17.479
Master Jiang, what do you want?

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:18.679
Xinruo.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.400
How have you been lately?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.360
What happened before was my fault.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.200
I lost my head
because Wu Peirong incited me.

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:32.879
I'll apologize to Pei Yuze.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.359
But Jin Se's death
had nothing to do with me.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.718
Yuze can decide
if he wants to forgive you or not.

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:39.799
I can't answer for him.

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:43.039
But is Xueshan's injury your doing?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.479
Didn't Pei Xueshan
ruin her own face in a dream?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.079
If you resent me,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.479
then take it out on me.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.559
Why would you do this to Xueshan?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.919
Do you realize that to Xueshan...

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.560
Stop acting so self-righteous.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:57.319
And besides,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.680
do you really think you know her?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.240
I bought you some snacks.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.360
Thanks.

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:22.599
I thought you'd be a little happier
after visiting the Pei family.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:27.239
Pei Xueshan admitted herself
that she poisoned you.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.800
Didn't we already suspect that?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.480
But she told me

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.960
that this poison has no antidote.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.559
If what she said is true...

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.439
I...

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.920
I can't just watch you die.

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:43.639
Didn't you say that

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:47.079
never give up until the very end?

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:49.919
You're letting worry cloud your mind.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.360
Pei Xueshan told you
there's no antidote,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.318
but she may have said it to shake you.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:56.839
It doesn't have to be true.

00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:00.039
That's right. We never give up,

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:01.759
until the very end.

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:04.520
Yuze...

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.560
Let's get married.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.120
I've been dying
to marry you and bring you home.

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:23.679
But now isn't the right time.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.599
The clue Jin Se left behind

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.000
points to Pei Xueshan
colluding with the Japanese.

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:31.678
Hu City probably
won't stay peaceful for long.

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:34.718
I also spoke with Jiang Yao today.

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:38.440
But I feel he doesn't know anything
about what Pei Xueshan has done.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.479
Pei Xueshan didn't
do all this for Jiang Yao.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.640
Then

00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:45.679
she must want to be
the family head herself.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.920
It looks like Jiang Yao is just
a puppet she carefully picked.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.280
Once her power grows strong enough,

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.199
she will cast Jiang Yao aside too.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:58.679
Her schemes run very deep.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.080
Pei Xueshan

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.040
will be even harder
to deal with than Pei Yujie.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.200
To force her to hand over the antidote,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.360
we have to take
what she cares about most.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.560
Yuze,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.560
let me do it this time.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:21.879
You've taught me so much.
Don't you want to see for yourself?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.000
Alright.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.079
I'll be watching.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.040
Xueshan, you should eat.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.560
I can't.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.720
What exactly happened
between you and Xinruo?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.480
Yao, I'm sorry.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.080
These past few days,
I lost control because of my injury.

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.639
I hurt a lot of people.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.559
I really didn't mean to.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.039
It's alright.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.039
I understand.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.519
You've been through a shock.
It's hard to accept.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.720
Losing control
of your emotions is natural.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.920
Yao...

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.119
Xinruo seems to think you killed Jin Se.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.919
That's why she's taking it out on me.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.039
Tell me the truth.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.959
Was it really you?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.240
No, it wasn't.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.359
Darn it.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.278
Xinruo must have been
misled by Pei Yuze

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.039
into thinking I killed Jin Se.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.680
Maybe it was his scheme

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:33.439
to drive a wedge between us.

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:35.838
Yao.

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.798
Pei Yuze clearly has his eyes
on the family head's seat.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.119
He's always targeting you.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.919
You're the only one I can rely on.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.640
I've already lost my father.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.599
I can't lose you too.

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:49.519
Don't worry.

00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:52.279
Pei Yuze won't get the chance.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.278
Congratulations, congratulations!

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.479
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.440
Please, come in.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.799
Miss Xinruo!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.718
Congratulations!

00:15:07.719 --> 00:15:10.079
No, I should say Family Head, not Miss.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.718
Right. My memory is failing me.

00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:13.238
Uncles, you're too polite.

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:13.999
Please, come inside.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.400
- Alright.
- Yes.

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:22.239
Xinruo, congratulations on
becoming the family head.

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:24.279
And soon you'll be
marrying Second Uncle.

00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:27.238
I had this Kirin of Fertility
custom-made just for you.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:29.239
May you be blessed with many children.

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.079
What's wrong?

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:37.359
Does this gift not suit your taste?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.720
Xueshan and Jiang Yao
put so much thought into it.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.880
We ought to accept this gift.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.960
It broke.

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:52.399
I'm so sorry.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.960
It slipped from my hand.

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.239
What's the matter?
Are you feeling unwell?

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:01.519
Miss Xinruo,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.360
could it be that you're expecting?

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.519
Not really.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.840
Just now,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.080
I suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.479
Second Master! Miss Lian!

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.680
Bad news!

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.880
