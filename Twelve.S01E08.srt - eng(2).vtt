{\an8}

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:19.204
TWELVE

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.585
On a day when the wind
howled across the land,

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:29.840
the God of Light awakened 12 animals
to grant them a calling.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.593
The 12 angels, endowed with that power,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.888
were born to guard and guide

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:38.849
the chaotic world.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.892
Taesan,

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.978
Wonseung, Doni,

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.647
Yangmi, Bangwool,

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.192
Mirr, Malsook, Master R,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.653
Jwidol, Hanu,

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.405
Kangji, and Dalgi.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.074
They were keepers of peace,

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.826
fulfilling the will of Light.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.537
Yet even as they brought

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.414
salvation to the world,

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.291
they also marked its crisis.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.504
Darkness, wary of the angels' powers,

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:10.714
unleashed evil energy

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.634
across the world through its followers.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.720
The light faded,

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.929
and the land rotted.

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:22.309
Black dust seeped into people's bodies,

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.852
turning them into evil spirits.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.783
The angels ultimately chose

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.410
to rise against the evil spirits

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.996
to defend humanity.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.459
Day after day,

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.002
as they vanquished evil spirits,

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.421
they continued

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.091
their arduous eternal battle.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.764
While the angels

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:05.894
endured endless attacks from evil spirits
that rose and vanished…

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:28.041
Darkness, through Ogwi and Samin,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.920
corrupted Haetae,
the mascot of the 12 angels,

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.713
transforming him into an evil spirit

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.590
and used his powers

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.009
to attack the angels.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.305
As Hanu, Master R,

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.144
Yangmi, and Dalgi fell
to Haetae's assault,

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.690
Taesan, consumed by rage and despair,
struck Haetae down.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.986
Then the evil energy
and the angels' powers

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.822
were sealed beneath the Hellmouth.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.049
After long years,

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.512
Samin, once believed dead,
appeared before the 12 angels

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.682
who had taken human form.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810
Taesan and the angels

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:33.315
were now entering another battle
that would shape their destiny.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.678

Join me,

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.521
and you'll acquire even greater power.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.815
You'll be unstoppable.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:07.784
How's that

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.828
for an answer?

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.311
Pull yourself together.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.809
Doni!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:07.936
Here I come!

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.980
Hanu!

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.732
Hanu!

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.391
TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:08.890
You fool.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.101
Haetae's power and the Dragon Soul
are already mine.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.104
After I turn the world into Hell,

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.316
I will transform all humans
into evil spirits.

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.986
Don't get cocky.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.211
If Mirr is the purpose of your life,

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.506
then you have no place in my hell.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.113
Just watch.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.120
ANGEL CAPITAL GROUP

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.601
Pathetic.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.355
She's just an empty shell.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.107
I wonder how you'll look

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.152
when you're killed by Mirr's powers.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.132
Mirr…

00:21:55.773 --> 00:21:56.774
Don't.

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.074
I guess he isn't rusty.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.501
Bangwool.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:45.781
Hanu! It's a good day for a barbecue!

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.788
Wonseung!

00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:33.222
Mirr, even if God ignores my prayers

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.516
and the other angels disapprove of us,

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.642
nothing will change.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:39.228
Have faith in me.
My feelings for you won't change.

00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:52.783
Ogwi…

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.501
No…

00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:32.281
Please, no… No…

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.077
No…

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.612
What the… Where are we?

00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:36.905
- Who are you?
- Where am I?

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.156
Where is this?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.867
- Why are we here?
- What's going on?

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.368
What is this place?

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.496
What on earth?

00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:48.584
Where am I?

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:52.337
- What the heck?
- Do you know where we are?

00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:54.464
- Why am I here?
- What is this place?

00:27:54.548 --> 00:27:56.633
- What's going on?
- What happened?

00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:41.637
Master R!

00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:44.348
Why am I sore all over?

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.641
What's wrong with me?

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.060
Wait, stop. Did someone beat me?

00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.228
- What?
- Why does it hurt so much?

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:53.273
Well… I wonder why.

00:28:57.277 --> 00:28:59.279
Yangmi!

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:07.496
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.580
Malsook.

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.085
Where am I?

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.419
What happened?

00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:19.383
What's wrong?

00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:31.019
- Hanu!
- Hanu!

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:37.859
Wait, he's not back?

00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:40.153
Doni!

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:42.698
- Hey, Jwidol.
- You!

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:44.950
You're slimmer.

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:46.910
- You're fatter.
- You're taller even.

00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.120
Get over here.

00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.790
He's sulky because you blocked
all his throwing stars.

00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:53.625
As if. Every one of them landed.

00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.294
Hey, let's grab something delicious.

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:57.546
Off we go!

00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:04.970
What's with this bush on your head?
You need a haircut.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.142
You haven't changed a bit.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:14.479
Dalgi, we have chicken a lot lately.

00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:16.732
- No, don't.
- Unbelievable.

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.316
I told you not to eat chicken.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.402
- Sorry about that.
- He always has the most.

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.280
Guys, you know I only eat the radish.

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:25.073
Radish made you this fat?

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:27.659
- Well said.
- Come on, guys.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.893
Hey, Chief!

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.978
Mirr.

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.356
Mirr!

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:36.520

{\an8}The strange phenomenon

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:41.149
{\an8}that once darkened our sky has vanished,

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:44.027
{\an8}and people are smiling as they go about

00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:45.904
their daily lives once more.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.365
Moving on,

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:50.617
we bring you a heartwarming story.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.329
Last Sunday,
an individual identifying as Tiger

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:57.249
left a box containing
an enormous sum of money

00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:00.710
outside an orphanage,
along with a note that read,

00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:02.420
"Hope this helps."

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.966
Despite many efforts,
his identity remains unknown,

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:07.884
{\an8}and the orphanage

00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:09.761
{\an8}- expressed their gratitude…

00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:11.888
{\an8}…through our news channel.

00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:14.224
This has been Park Jiyun with the news.

00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:15.851
That's Taesan for you.

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.233
This carrot juice…

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.153
It tastes weird.

00:32:33.743 --> 00:32:36.121
I love it.

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:45.130
Kangji.
Why didn't you wake me up to join you?

00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:47.424
Didn't Yangmi and Dalgi
keep you up all night?

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:48.967
Don't get me started.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.219
They were curious about everything,

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:53.680
so they bombarded me
with questions all night.

00:32:57.601 --> 00:32:59.060
Still, we can't skip our routine.

00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:02.397
It sure feels good to work out again.

00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.067
- I bet you warmed up on the way here.
- Of course. Shall we?

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:07.152
Let's go.

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:12.824
- Let me put this out there today.
- That exercising shouldn't be like labor?

00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:15.994
Actually, no. It's been a while,
so let's run our hearts out.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.078
See ya.

00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:19.289
Greetings, this is an AI-assisted call.

00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:21.041
How may I help you?

00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:22.500
Hello?

00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:24.669
When are your business hours?

00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:28.381
Our hours are from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.218
Then, do you have a dish you'd recommend?

00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:33.887
Sure. The menu will be sent to your phone.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.971
Thanks.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.772
Here we go.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.608
"TODAY'S SPECIAL"

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.402
No way.

00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:51.738
Hanu, let's grab a bowl of this!

00:33:54.324 --> 00:33:56.076
Hey, Doni, what is it?

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:58.995
What's that? What did you buy?

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.205
This looked delicious.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.082
What's this?

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.210
Mmm. It's cotton candy.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.463
Mmm. What a treat.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.007
Did God make this too?

00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.926
No, humans.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:14.052
Really?

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:17.514
Can I have more of that money?

00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:18.598
Money?

00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:21.184
Nope, you've got to work for that.

00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:23.979
Just so you know, I talked to Chief

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:25.438
so you can do some work.

00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:30.235
From now on, address me as "sir."

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.410
What is it?

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.662
Just call me "sir," you punk.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.293
Okay. Stop it.

00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:48.336
Say it. "Sir."

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.630
Sure, I got it.

00:34:50.714 --> 00:34:51.840
Say, "sir!"

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.760
Fine, sir. Are you happy now?

00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:56.845
There we go.

00:34:58.138 --> 00:35:00.098
Let's get something else.
This isn't filling.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:01.850
No, it isn't.

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.312
Come on, I found an incredible place.
Their portions are huge.

00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:08.940
Don't have too much.

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:14.154
- Humans are truly amazing.
- Right?

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.656
I didn't know their technology
would advance so quickly.

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:19.868
Ask me anything you want to know.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.661
While you were asleep,

00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.079
I kept a record

00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:26.791
of every event and historical moment
on this device.

00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:28.752
On this?

00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:32.714
Is this a living organism?
How is that possible?

00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:34.674
It's not like that.

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:38.970
Too much information at once
could give you a migraine,

00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:40.180
so let's take it slow.

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:43.183
First, learn how to use this.

00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:46.436
What's this?

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.729
- That's a cell phone.
- What?

00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:49.481
A cell phone.

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.067
It's not something you eat.

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:54.152
You don't eat it.

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:57.572
Humans can't go a single day
without this device.

00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.283
With this,

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:03.161
we can talk to each other
no matter how far apart we are.

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.122
This can provide everything you need

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.416
to make life easier.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.584
What?

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:11.920
It's like this. With this device…

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:15.674
hmm, you can play games,

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:16.758
as well as

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:20.470
order food, and buy clothes.

00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:22.764
Come on. Who are you kidding?

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.557
Did you hone your lies while I was away?

00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:25.642
It's true.

00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:26.768
As if.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:27.977
It's true.

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:30.021
Hear Wonseung's voice first, then.

00:36:30.105 --> 00:36:31.314
Is Wonseung in this thing?

00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:32.524
Of course.

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:37.487
There's audio too.

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.825
I'm also at the office, you know.

00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.076
"JWIDOL"

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.579
Why are you calling me
when I'm right here?

00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:47.914
I'm busy!

00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:49.416
Let me study in peace.

00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:53.712
"6TH MOCK CSAT"

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.548
Why is catching bad guys this complicated?

00:36:57.298 --> 00:36:58.925
Hey, what are you up to?

00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:01.010
I'm studying to be a detective.

00:37:01.094 --> 00:37:02.971
What? That came out of nowhere.

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:05.598
What's gotten into you?

00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:09.853
Being the chief was never meant for me.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.398
I'm going to succeed Marok instead.

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:16.234
Good thinking.
It's never easy to lead a team.

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:19.195
I'm rooting for you.

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:20.280
Good luck.

00:37:34.878 --> 00:37:36.171
Dalgi, how's this?

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:38.214
Yangmi,

00:37:38.298 --> 00:37:40.425
what do you think this is?
Do people wear this?

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:42.010
I don't think so.

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.012
- Really?
- That's a purse.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.847
Oh, a purse!

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.640
Kangji, isn't this a purse?

00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:48.892
It's not.

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.853
There's more to choose from,
so look around.

00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:53.688
It's something you wear?

00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:58.693
What do you think of this?
Isn't it a pretty color?

00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:00.904
It is. It looks good on you.

00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.155
- Really?
- Let me try.

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.909
Let me see.
This'll be comfortable to fight in.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.461
I'm exhausted.

00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:32.644
Mmm. Finally, I feel awake.

00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:35.438
Ah.

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:41.986
Hey, there. It's nice to meet you.

00:38:50.787 --> 00:38:51.955
Welcome.

00:38:52.622 --> 00:38:54.249
How can I help you?

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.917
Help me with everything, please.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.001
Got it.

00:38:57.544 --> 00:38:59.170
This has just been released.

00:38:59.254 --> 00:39:02.590
"Add this week's baseball schedule
to my calendar."

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.595
"ADD THIS WEEK'S BASEBALL SCHEDULE
TO MY CALENDAR"

00:39:08.388 --> 00:39:11.391
That's good. I'll take 12.

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:13.810
- Did you say 12?
- Yes, there are 12 of us.

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:15.520
I'll be at your service.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:18.690
Here are the 12 phones you ordered.

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.567
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:27.740
Just a second.

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:30.785
Hanu.

00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:41.170
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:44.173
Oh.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.302
Hmm?

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.973
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:54.517
Guys, I bet you're hungry.

00:39:56.561 --> 00:40:00.899
Because many people
see museums as intimidating,

00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:04.110
I wanted to make the experience
less daunting and more accessible.

00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:07.363
Hmm. That's a fun idea,

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.365
and I admire how you're thinking

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:11.618
about the public.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.662
Please forward me the project proposal,

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.164
and I'll plan a design.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.415
- Really?
- Yes.

00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:19.709
I have another meeting scheduled,

00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:23.046
so I'll share a draft with you
by the end of this week.

00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:24.714
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:33.806
Please get back to me.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.891
Sure.

00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:04.295
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:08.216
Unbelievable.
You're dragging your feet again.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:09.425
Didn't you read the text?

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.848
- Let's go.
- Sure.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.061
Bangwool!

00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:22.230
Did she just…

00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:24.232
She talked.

00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:33.908
All right. Here's to Geumsoon and Manbok
opening their new street food restaurant.

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:35.118
A round of applause.

00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:37.495
"STELLA TTEOKBOKKI"

00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:40.790
- Bon appétit!
- Bon appétit!

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:41.874
That looks so good.

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:43.918
- Yangmi, enjoy.
- Show me how to eat this.

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:46.337
- Dalgi, you too.
- Well, just dig in, Hanu.

00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:49.507
- Try dipping that in the sauce.
- In that?

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.591
Isn't it good?

00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:52.010
- It's good.
- There you go.

00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:54.470
Oh, boy.

00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:58.099
- You'll enjoy the combo.
- Mmm!

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.308
It's so good.

00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:00.393
Try that.

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.439
Look at you eat.

00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.525
Doni's combo recommendations
never disappoint.

00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:10.111
- Dig in before it gets cold.
- It's so nicely chewy!

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:13.114
- It's better when hot.
- Geumsoon, it's delicious!

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.574
Dalgi, this is chicken.

00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:15.658
You shouldn't eat this.

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.079
- Try that.
- The fritters are incredible.

00:42:20.163 --> 00:42:21.873
Geumsoon, can we get more fritters?

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:24.375
Mr. Taesan, not you too.

00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:25.543
I'll get them.

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:28.671
- It's so good.
- You should dip this in that.

00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:29.797
- Really?
- Yes.

00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:31.090
- Is it good?
- It's good.

00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:33.509
- Siwan's here.
- We're here.

00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.261
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.804
Hi!

00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:39.640
You sweetie-pie.

00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:41.642
He's adorable.

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.561
Mister, would you like
to hold my grandson?

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:45.646
Should I?

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.941
But he's tiny.

00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:50.234
He's being shy.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.944
Goodness.

00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:55.239
Hey, there.

00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:57.992
Aren't you a sweetie-pie?

00:42:58.076 --> 00:42:59.786
He looks just like you, Geumsoon.

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:02.538
- Look, he's smiling.
- There you go.

00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:08.737
