(A Hundred Memories)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.120
Wait. He's Giant.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.790
Hey!

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.889
What are you? Are you some kind of pervert?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.960
Unbelievable.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.469
We're late. Hurry up!

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.740
I appreciate all your work.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.349
Your moms feed you nice, warm meals,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.449
and all you do is spend your days picking fights?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.290
- Sir, that's not what happened. - Quiet.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.820
What do you think this is, your school?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.200
Should we start keeping an attendance sheet for you here?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860
You rascals...

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.670
And who's this one now?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.570
What's your deal? A new face?

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.810
- Come on. - Wait! Stop!

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.440
Where do you think you're putting your hands?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.910
The police are supposed to protect and serve.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.110
Are you thugs?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.580
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.020
Why are you hitting someone's kid in the head?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.890
- Is this how you treat the victim? - Well...

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.360
Actually, he's not the victim.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.859
And besides, this is a case of mutual assault. Okay?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.390
Even if it was mutual!

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.259
Someone had to have thrown the first punch!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.359
My son doesn't have the guts to do something like that.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.330
So it must've been these punks, right?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.269
You don't even check for that, and you just go and act like this?

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.599
Do you think this is what I pay my taxes for?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.139
Okay, sir. I understand. But first, please calm down.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.409
I'm not your father!

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.609
Get your chief out here! Do you know who I am?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.950
I'm Han Gi Bok!

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.150
Okay?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.250
The chief and I exchanged business cards over breakfast.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.520
We've even been to the sauna together. Okay?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.520
That's the kind of man I am.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.720
Do you understand?

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.530
All right.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.800
Where's the chief's office? Is this it?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.470
- Chief Jang! Chief Jang Joong Pil! - Sir, please!

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.250
Incredible.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.380
Hey. Koh Yeong Rye.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.820
Hey.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.490
- Yes? - Snap out of it, will you?

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.730
And wipe your drool.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.299
(Let's keep the environment clean and welcome a new Incheon.)

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.369
(Incheon Metropolitan City Hall)

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.700
That was so good.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.999
If we had this much fun just watching it,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.669
can you imagine how much fun the actors must have had?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.970
I wonder why he did that.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.910
What kind of situation could it have been?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.180
You get to live so many different lives.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.709
One day, a rich man's daughter.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.720
And the next, a girl from a small town.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.450
That must be so thrilling, don't you think?

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.490
He looked like he got hurt. I wonder if he's okay.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.820
Maybe I should've gone after him.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.560
Are you not listening to me?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.889
Am I talking to myself here? Koh Yeong Rye!

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.630
- What? - What?

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.730
What is it?

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.670
I asked you a question, so it'd be nice if you answered.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.870
No, it's just...

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.079
That guy from before.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080
What guy?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.910
The lead actor?

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.379
No, not from the movie.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.680
I mean that student by the entrance to the theater.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.419
I wonder why he did that.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.120
A student? Give me a break.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.390
He was obviously a creep.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.760
You get people like that at theaters sometimes.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.030
The uniform could have just been a disguise.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.370
He didn't seem like that to me.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.040
I want to see that movie again.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.339
Let's watch it again!

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.809
(Episode 2: Whatever We Become, Letâ€™s Meet Again)

(Cheongah Bus)

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.050
The line goes like this.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.850
"First, you kill them."

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.490

"Swallowing my pride..."

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.090
A pervert?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.659
Come on. That's ridiculous.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.899
"Every time I've asked to sleep with you..."

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.969
Oh, my.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.399
"Sleep with you?" I can't take it!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.809
"You've always turned me down cold."

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.340
"I'm only human."

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.509
"So I'm going to do the same to you."

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.449
- Oh, my. - Goodness gracious.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.779
My heart's pounding out of my chest. I'm going to lose my mind.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.620
- That Aema is a real modern woman. - Hey. Three Corns.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.360
Ok Hui. It's your turn to scrub today.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760
Me?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.130
Yes.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.140
Okay. I got it.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.639
Now, where were we?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640
Right.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.679
"I'll do the same to you..."

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.780
Excuse me.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.820
Hey, you guys.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.719
Do you know any place with Giant in the name?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520
Like Giant Arcade or something,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.260
or Giant Billiards?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.590
Have you seen a place like that around?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.899
"Giant?"

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.969
Why're you looking for that place? Is it any good?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.070
I've never heard of it.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.239
No, that's not it...

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.699
What are you looking for, then?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.910
We can't help you if you're not specific.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.380
No, it's fine. Never mind.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.120
- Come on. Just tell us. - Spit it out.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.969
Jae Pil.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.969
Sae Ri? What is it? You can't fall asleep?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.970
Jae Pil.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.980
Jae Pil. What happened to your face?

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.149
Did Dad hit you again?

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.210
No.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.519
I just ran into a telephone pole.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.990
That was pretty stupid of me, right?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.060
Come here.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.990
Gosh. The bed is too high for you.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.330
- You can't sleep? - No.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.070
What song will make my Princess Sae Ri fall asleep?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.910
Magic Princess Sae Ri has come to see you

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.349
All the way from the moon to the Earth below

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.280
- Jae Pil? - Yes?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.220
What's love?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.720
Mom says she's starved for love.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.060
I wonder.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.700
I've never been in love, so I wouldn't know.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.900
But I bet it's something really wonderful.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.170
If it's so wonderful, why haven't you ever been in love?

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.400
Because it's so wonderful.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.270
I'm saving it for later, so I can cherish it.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.280
- Now, go to sleep. - Okay.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.960
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.200
Why are you hugging my leg for dear life?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.070
Were you dreaming?

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.240
- What were you dreaming about? - I wasn't.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.169
No! I wasn't dreaming at all.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.409
I wasn't.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.280
Gosh. It's already a beautiful morning!

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.350
No!

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.630
Gosh. Hae Ja!

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.559
- Darn it. - Hae Ja. Are you okay?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.900
- Did you hurt your bottom? - Hold on.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.969
Koh Yeong Rye. What was that? Did you just push me?

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.469
No, I didn't mean to push you.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.880
That towel is the one we use to wipe our feet.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.340
What I'm trying to say is...

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.110
I'm sorry, Hae Ja.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.889
The girls in this room are getting stranger by the day.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.049
This place is a total chaostrophe!

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.860
Hae Ja. The word is catastrophe, not chaostrophe.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.260
Are you okay? Stop it, you!

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.530
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

Hey.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.410
You.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.810
This Giant thing. What is this?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.980
You're hiding something, aren't you?

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.580
Hiding? What would I hide?

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.550
Well...

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.060
My gut says it's a guy.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.390
A guy? What are you talking about?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.000
Yes. It's written all over your face.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.239
Hey. Who is it?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.300
Spit it out, now.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.539
Who is Giant?

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.069
I'm telling you it's not like that.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.080
Hey.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.210
Are you really going to start keeping secrets from me?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.819
Who is he?

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.390
- Who is he? - I don't know.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.420
He's just some guy I don't know.

Hey! Who is this guy that you don't know?

Hey!

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.029
- Jae Pil. Did you hear? - Come over here.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.069
They said Deok Gu and the guys got called to the dean's office.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.940
And there's going to be a disciplinary hearing soon, too.

Hey.

What are you going to say?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.010
March in and demand to know why we're not being punished too?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.350
Deok Gu is competing in the High School Sports Festival.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.780
If he's disciplined, he might not get to compete.

It's no use, you idiot.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.819
Do you think if you go in and say, "Punish me too, please,"

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.259
that they'll say, "You want to be punished too?"

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.790
"Okay." You think that's what they'll say?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.800
You'll just rub salt in the wound. Just stay put.

No, I'm his father.

I have to get to work.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.800
I think he's embarrassed I packed it so he always leaves it behind.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.300
Tell him I made it extra special today.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.240

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.500

Your father asked me to give you this.

Did you...

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.160
tell my dad I was here?

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.630
If you're done, why don't you leave?

This is a complaint for the Board of Education. How convenient.

Yes, I am.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.870
Gosh. Some people...

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.640
Here you go.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.380
Thank you.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.110
Hey! Can't you stand up straight?

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.450
Just a bunch of kids, still wet behind the ears.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.220
Hurry up. Let's go!

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.230
Koh Yeong Rye?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.570
Koh Yeong Rye!

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.569
Where have you been?

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.880
Do you have any idea what time it is?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.480
Hey.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.649
Don't tell me you were at that Giant place again...

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.650
Seo Jong Hee.

00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:07.720
(Cheongah Bus)

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.650
I need you to slap me.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.420
What?

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.960
I need to snap out of it.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.530
Go on. Do it. And make it hard.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.860
Seriously?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.300
Yes, I'm serious.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.730
I promise I won't hold it against you.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.800
Just do it.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.709
Wait.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.549
Wait.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.710
Don't hit me.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.580
Just pinch me. That's better.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.520
Where have you been?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.490
So did you end up meeting Giant or not?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.430
From now on,

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.930
I'm going to forget all about Giant.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.200
And...

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.340
I'm going to apply for that instead.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.910
(Recruiting Applicants for Night School)

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.860
If I enroll in this,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.900
you're sure the company will give me time off for this, right?

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400
Yes.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.530
I checked. I'm sure.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.400
But studying and I just don't mix.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.970
And there's one more important thing.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.040
Apparently, you need a diploma to be in the Miss Korea pageant.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.390
Gosh. They're all so pretty.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.130
We're pretty too.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.160
Right. You mean you.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.460
You're pretty too.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.500
Although I am a bit prettier, of course.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.970
Anyway...

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.809
Are you going to completely forget about Giant...

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.369
Hey. Why would you bring him up again?

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.379
Don't bring up Giant anymore.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.780
Just don't.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.380
Giant.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.090
Now, I'm stuck having to go to school.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.419
Since we have to go anyway,

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.290
night school kids should get uniforms.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.930
Day students and night students. Isn't this blatant discrimination?

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.729
Uniforms cost money, you know.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.900
I guess since we're basically going for free.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.800
That's just sad.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.540
All this sadness is making me hungry.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.010
Let's go get something to eat.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.070
Food?

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.110
I know an amazing place for soybean paste stew.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.510
Do you want to go?

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:50.950
Let's go.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.620
- Let's go. - Go!

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.150
This is the place.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.890
Koh Yeong Bae. Koh Yeong Mi.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.160
- Yeong Rye! - Yeong Rye!

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.500
How have you two been?

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.740
Say hello. This is my friend.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.370
Hello.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.040
Go on. Say hello.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.810
Hello.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.810
Hi, little ones.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.080
I'm your sister's friend,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.420
Seo Jong Hee.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.820
Here. I got you something!

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.090
Pastries!

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.060
Gosh. Pastries!

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.600
Pastries!

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.640
Yeong Mi. Here, have some water.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.110
You too, Yeong Bae.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580
Koh Yeong Mi.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.949
Do you know what 4 divided by 4 is?

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.249
No. What's that?

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.949
It's 1. If there are 4 people and 4 pastries,

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.090
it means each person gets to eat one.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.720
I guess being a stickler for the numbers runs in the family.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.260
But...

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.830
Even in math, there's a little wiggle room.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.430
Here you go.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.470
Today's your lucky day.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.310
Okay.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.840
Thank you.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.740
Eat slowly.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.450
Should I give some to Yeong Bae too?

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.190
- Mom. - Good grief. You're always here.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.259
I told you to sleep in on your day off.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.559
Why do you keep coming over?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.830
Goodness. You are so stubborn.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.960
My mom's got such a sharp tongue.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.500
Even though she's happy to see me.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.070
Happy? As if.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.670
Why would I be happy about another mouth to feed?

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.310
And who's this?

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.479
Hello, I'm...

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.280
I'm Yeong Rye's roommate. My name is Seo Jong Hee.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.910
Is that right?

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.280
Well, now, look at you.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.280
Aren't you a pretty one?

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.290
Since you're here, you might as well stay for a bite.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.590
Good thing you don't look like a big eater.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.220
Give it.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.390
That's just her way of saying she's glad you're here.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.029
That's just how my mom is.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.530
I got the message, loud and clear.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.499
Mom. Is Yeong Sik coming home late today?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.740
I feel like I haven't seen him in ages.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.110
Hi, brother!

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.179
Hyeon. Hi.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.250
Hey.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.719
Even Mr. Popular gets tired, I see.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.219
Tired? Not at all.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.559
If my smile can bring happiness to even one person...

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.759
Then, according to the Constitution of Korea, Article ten.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.589
"All citizens have the right to pursue happiness."

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.000
You'll find an excuse for anything, won't you?

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.269
Are you just getting here now? I didn't see you in class.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.630
No, I'm on my way out.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.970
I decided to skip class.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.400
The weather was too nice, so I was photosynthesizing.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.070
Hey. But why are you leaving already?

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.039
Right. Today's the day, isn't it?

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.750
That tutoring gig. Your secret side hustle.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.079
Thanks for setting me up.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.420
I'll treat you when I get my first paycheck.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.590
Don't worry. Think of all the meals I eat at your place.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.419
You know that's in my neighborhood, right?

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.460
I'll be around, so when you're done...

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.630
Why?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.360
Again?

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.929
The Constitution of Korea, Article 17.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.200
"All citizens have the right to privacy and freedom from intrusion."

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.640
So call me. I'm not eating dinner until you do.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.399
Please, take it. No need to make a fuss.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.709
The wife of the Hwashin Electronics chairman told me...

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.540
that you were a top student at Minguk University.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.149
I was expecting you to look geeky,

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.750
but you're quite handsome.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.149
Has anyone ever...

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.090
told you that you look like Clark Gable?

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.359
You know, the actor from "Gone with the Wind?"

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.590
I think there's a resemblance in your eyes and your jawline.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.889
- Do you think so? - Yes.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.960
In any case...

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.069
My Jae Pil is a pretty good student,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.870
but he seems to have hit a plateau.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.070
And since he's my husband's only son...

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.879
By the way, what about you? Do you have any siblings?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.840
I have two younger sisters and a younger brother.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.180
I suppose your brother is around my son's age.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.380
Hi.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.950
So it looks like Jae Pil has finished changing his clothes.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.019
Shall we head upstairs now, Mr. Koh?

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.760
Okay.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.060
- Where to? The 2nd floor. Right. - The 2nd floor.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.510
A top law student tutoring illegally?

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.750
I guess grades and character are usually inversely proportional.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.450
Well, I don't know about that.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.790
But poverty and conscience usually are.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.420
Something you'll probably never have to learn.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.959
For now, we'll focus on English and Math.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.030
Today will be Math.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.830
Try this one first.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.600
I'm going to time you, so pace yourself.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.190
If it's like you said, and good grades mean bad character,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.660
that means you must have a great personality?

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.459
So let's put that great character to use, work hard,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.260
and pull those grades up. Shall we?

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.970
You'd have to try to get this first question wrong.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.029
But since you've pulled off such a difficult feat,

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.500
I'm sure you'll have no problem overcoming any other obstacles.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.570
And since you're supposedly so smart...

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.510
So, shall we begin?

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.510
Look.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.720
- That's wrong. - Goodness gracious.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.449
Look how pitch-black the bottoms of their feet are.

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:11.989
Were they rolling around in a coal pit?

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.960
At this rate, crows are going to ask to be friends.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.789
- Yeong Rye. - Yes?

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.090
Go wash Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi's feet.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.469
Koh Yeong Bae. Koh Yeong Mi. On the count of two. Get up. Move!

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.800
- One, two! - One, two!

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.039
All right, I'll go get them cleaned up.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.569
- Okay. - Let's go.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.670
Let's go.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.140
Here. You wear the shoes.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.880
- Is this Yeong Rye's room? - Am I first?

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.550
Just look at your feet!

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.740
(Certificate of Commendation, Certificate of Appreciation)

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.449
(Academic Excellence Award: Koh Yeong Sik)

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.650
(Award Certificate: Koh Yeong Bae)

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.360
I can't make out a single word of this.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.469
Who are you?

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.839
I'm Seo Jong Hee. I work with Yeong Rye.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.439
I'm sorry for just walking in like this.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.510
It's okay.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.080
Seo Jong Hee. That's a pretty name. Nice to meet you.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.360
Who's this?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.030
This is Seo Jong Hee. She's Yeong Rye's friend from work.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.329
Do you two know each other?

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.400
No, I just met her myself.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.660
Jong Hee, this is...

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.400
Yeong Sik. When did you get here?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.270
Looks like Jeong Hyeon is here again.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.500
Hi, Ugly.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.840
Long time no see. You've gotten even uglier.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.140
It's not him, is it?

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.050
No wonder.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.150
Hello. You must be Yeong Rye's brother.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.750
My name is Seo Jong Hee.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.830
What's that "that explains it" supposed to mean?

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.700
Go wait outside.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.500
- I'm getting a strange vibe here. - Go on. Hurry up.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.280
- Mom. - What?

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.210
Putting pumpkin in soybean paste stew is a little strange.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.880
What's wrong with it?

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.980
Pumpkin is pumpkin.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.849
The market lady was throwing it out just because it was a bit cracked.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.120
So I snatched it up.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.460
Gosh. Seriously, Mother?

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.930
That was a brilliant choice. So that was the secret ingredient.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.160
Goodness.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.900
- Yes. - You're one smooth talker.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.430
So, how is it? Is it any good?

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.570
I'll use a fresh one for you next time.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.869
Not at all, Mother.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.440
It's way better than with zucchini.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.510
Goodness. Eat up. Don't just pick at your food.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.950
Your eyes aren't just tired. They look completely sunken.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.420
Is that a human face or a skull?

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.950
Here. Eat up.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.050
Okay.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.190
Right.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.229
- Hey. Are you going to... - Oh, no.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.730
You're not? Okay.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.710
- For me? - Go ahead.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.850
Here. You guys eat.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.879
- Goodness. - No.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.790
What are you doing, eating that with your hands?

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.420
Slow down. Eat slowly.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.990
Goodness gracious.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.530
Don't fight over it.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.430
- By the way, Mom. - Yes?

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.030
I...

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.040
I applied to night school with Jong Hee.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240
What?

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.839
You'd have better luck getting blood from a stone.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.210
What studying?

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.450
And how in the world are you going to pay the tuition?

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.180
I don't have to pay tuition. My company is paying for it.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.449
They said there's a government subsidy.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.550
Even so, it will still cost a pretty penny.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.290
What about a bag and supplies? Do you think those are free?

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.029
Don't worry, Mother.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.100
If it's a government subsidy, it'll probably cover most costs.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.429
Anyway, Ugly.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.800
You'll have to get prettier for high school. You are in trouble.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.300
They'll kick you out if you're ugly.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.170
Seo Jong Hee. Stop laughing.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.309
Don't even react to him. Hurry up and eat.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.410
Why not?

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.909
Hey. You will. I'm serious.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.250
You could even set a record?

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.819
- Stop it. - Your sister really is ugly.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.649
- Just eat your food. - Are you my brother?

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.889
- I'm your dad. Now, hurry and eat. - Just eat.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.890
Is that right?

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.600
Why is that guy always coming over to our house to eat?

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.570
Is he really from a rich family?

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.800
He says Mom's cooking is better than his family's housekeeper's.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.410
What's this?

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.010
You said you were starting school.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.250
These are my old notebooks. Thought they might help.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.080
Now, get going.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.470
And here I thought he didn't care.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.350
Let's go.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.580
I mean, seriously.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.449
He's so smart,

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.960
and so handsome, too.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.020
Do they pick their tutors based on looks?

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.830
I told you to interview a tutor,

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.300
not hold an audition for a movie star.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.799
Stop going on about his looks.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.710
Come on. If equal, pick the best. It's a bonus that he's handsome.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.280
In any case...

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.539
I have a feeling...

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.679
he's just the person to get Jae Pil in a top school.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.879
No doubt about it.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.620
My gut tells me he's trustworthy.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.350
I guess we'll see.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.550
Water.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.520
Jae Pil.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.290
Where are you off to at this hour?

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.530
I'm going to the boxing gym.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.900
Oh, my gosh. You must be out of your mind.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.359
Do you want your father to kill you again?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.669
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.830
Just be back early.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.140
Don't stay out too late.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.710
Well, that's a first.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.839
I mean, he should be breathing fire right now.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.540
What's gotten into Mr. Han?

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.450
You know what they say. Sudden changes mean death is near.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.220
Is there something you'd like to say?

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.320
What?

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.720
No, it's nothing.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.190
Alright, off you go.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.940
That kid's harder to read than Han Gi Bok.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.610
Okay, you go first.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.040
One-two.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.880
- Give me an uppercut. - Wait a second.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.379
So you're free to come to the gym whenever you want?

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.520
Yes, Sang Cheol.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.720
You've said that a dozen times. Now, hit me.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.459
It's just so hard to believe!

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.959
Seriously, what's gotten into your dad?

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.830
Getting your friends off suspension and even letting you box...

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.960
Like the old saying goes, if someone suddenly changes...

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.629
Anyway, it's really something else.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.830
Alright, hit me.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.840
Nice.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.799
Punch properly. Come on.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.839
To celebrate you becoming a free man,

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.309
I planned a killer event.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.779
- You're not going to box, right? - You've got to come.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.979
You don't get to say no, got it?

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.480
What kind of trouble are you cooking up now?

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.380
This wouldn't even count as trouble.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.550
You know our exams are coming up, right?

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.890
On the day it's over,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.230
let's go on a 4-on-4 group date.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.959
This Christmas...

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.170
I want to have a girlfriend to spend Christmas with.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.370
What about the girl from Ddoddo Snack Bar?

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.400
Oh, her?

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.439
Turns out she's already taken.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.209
That's why I want to do it too. The group date.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.879
Come on. Let's do it. What do you say, Jae Pil?

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.249
A group date? Forget it. I'm out.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.679
Come on. Why not?

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.549
You always say no to everything.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.989
Do you know what the three most important things in life are?

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.250
Faith, hope, and love!

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.989
And the greatest of these is love. Do you understand?

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:09.119
Don't come crying to me later.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.889
When your big brother gives you a chance, you should jump on it.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.959
Who knows? You might meet the love of a lifetime.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.199
Okay. Cut it out and get over here.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.999
Hey. You just said okay.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.699
- Just start already. - So you're in.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.899
Of course. Come on.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.199
- Are you in or not? - Just hit already!

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.009
- Are you in or out? - Hit me.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.670
- You're in, right? - Hit me properly.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.379
- You're in, right? - Good one.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.010
You said you're in. We're going!

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.850
Do your footwork.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.350
(Cheongah Bus)

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.320
- Hey. - Good luck today!

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.830
Gosh. That was rough.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.729
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.039
Do you like that you're going to school?

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.509
Are they teaching you anything good?

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.540
That's what I'm saying.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240
What?

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.779
Well, look how pretty this is.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.980
Don't touch it!

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.650
Gosh.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.160
How was that?

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.300
My angry act was pretty good, right?

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.130
Did I get you?

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:26.569
Awesome, right?

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.469
You gave me a real fright.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.709
Goodness gracious. You nearly scared me to death, girl.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.810
I almost let a bad word slip out.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.150
But you've really got a knack for it?

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.549
You're going to be a real actress someday.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.779
- Really? - Yes.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.820
Come to think of it, you're right.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.589
Yeong Rye. We're going to be late for school.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.789
- Let's hurry. - Okay.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.590
- Thanks for the compliment. - You bet.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.260
Be careful crossing the street!

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:57.400
(Hwaran Girls' High School Art Exhibition)

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.970
Gosh. Back to school.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:06.640
School.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.450
I never imagined this, not even in my wildest dreams.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.579
I'm actually going to school.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.480
Do you think I ever imagined this?

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.350
Studying. Gosh.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.820
How in the world did I end up here?

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.430
Here.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.990
What's this?

00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:26.659
I got one for you.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.100
A little something to celebrate our first day of school.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.600
So this is your way of telling me to study hard?

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.010
Gosh. This is exactly what I've always wanted!

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.610
It's just...

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:49.450
I just hope we can write a new chapter in our lives together.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:54.320
Thanks for going to school with me, Seo Jong Hee.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.630
You...

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.030
Now I can't fall asleep during class, can I?

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.469
You've totally got me wrapped around your finger, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.900
You bet. If you start to nod off, I'll be there to wake you up.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.809
You're one scary woman.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.710
You're a sly fox disguised as a teddy bear.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.810
Okay, fine.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.080
Since...

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.420
Since you were so thoughtful, I'll carry it with me always.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.020
I can't promise I'll actually study with it, though.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.520
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.970
- What is it? - Look at this.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.869
(Good luck to whoever is studying here!)

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.109
That's cute.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.810
That's adorable. I should write back.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.070
Excuse me. One second. I think my MyMy is at my desk.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.200
It's here. Thank goodness.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.140
Excuse me. You're from Bus 100, right?

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.340
You're the one who gave me a ride when I was about to be late.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.010
Oh, right!

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.449
You're that student.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.819
That's me. I can't believe you're here...

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.089
- It's so good to see you! - It's so good to see you too!

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.219
This is so crazy. What are the odds...

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.260
Hello?

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.759
I was there with her that day, you know?

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.990
Get over here, then.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.730
This is so wild.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.499
- Mom. - Yes?

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.069
Why are you closing up so early today?

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.240
Well, it's nice to have a day like this once in a while.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.780
We sold out of all the sugar we brought.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.650
And we were packed with customers for the horse rides all day long.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:57.850
Oh, gosh.

00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:01.179
If every day were like today, we would be rich in no time.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.119
Really? Are we rich now, Mom?

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.450
Of course! To us, this is a fortune.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.289
Yeong Bae. Yeong Mi. Come here for a second.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.290
Okay!

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.260
Here you go.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.669
Here. Go buy yourselves some ice pops.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.099
Gosh. Ice pops!

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.400
Let's go, Yeong Mi!

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.170
Honestly.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.940
It's the little things that make them so happy.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.710
Oh, my goodness!

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:39.760
Oh, no!

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.860
Oh, no.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.570
Oh, goodness.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.909
Koh Yeong Rye. Hurry home!

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.980
Your mom was in an accident and got hurt!

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520
Mom!

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.690
Mom, are you okay? Are you all right?

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.100
What's all the fuss?

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.699
I'm not dead. Don't be so dramatic.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.130
What happened?

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.740
How did this happen?

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.810
She was pulling her cart up a hill, and she fell.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.870
She cut up her knees and arms a bit.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.080
And I told her to go to the hospital in case of internal injuries,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.509
but she's being stubborn, as usual.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.850
Mom, come on. You're really worrying me.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.689
We need to get you to a hospital.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.189
A hospital? Don't be ridiculous.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.460
Cut the nonsense.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.030
The hospital is the least of my worries.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.700
That cart. What am I going to do about the cart?

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.429
I had to go to the head of my savings club...

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:02.400
and beg to get the first payout so I could finally buy it.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.239
I still have a year of payments, and now I've gone and destroyed it.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.439
What am I going to do? Goodness.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.909
- Mom. - Mom.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:13.010
I guess you can't escape your fate.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:17.320
I just had to open my big mouth and say we were okay. I jinxed it.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.120
That's how I feed my family of five. What am I going to do?

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.460
My poor kids. What's going to happen to them?

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:34.640
Mom.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.820
(Bus)

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.310
One at a time, please!

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.340
Hurry on up.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.550
All clear!

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:02.520
Manager,

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.130
can't you make just one exception?

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.599
Please, sir. Just this once.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.030
I'm in a really desperate spot.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.870
Yeong Rye. Are you that desperate?

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.600
Yes.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.099
Well, I've got bigger problems. All right?

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.570
Corporate is breathing down my neck about our deposit numbers.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:21.610
This job is going to be the death of me.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.249
And I'd like to live a long life.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.449
Manager.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:27.520
Forget it. Every single one of you has some sob story.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.549
Someone's parents are on death's door.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.519
For another, their house is flooded and destroyed every other day.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.089
I mean, if I hear this sob story and that sob story,

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.759
how is the company supposed to stay in business?

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.860
Are we running a charity here?

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.529
Do you think money just grows on trees?

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.459
That we can just pluck it whenever we want?

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.460
Then...

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.969
If you can't give me a two-month advance...

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.729
- How about just one month's? - Hey.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.740
What if you just take the advance and run off?

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.639
How am I supposed to cover that?

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.469
You're really making this difficult for me.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:52.470
For goodness' sake.

00:52:52.471 --> 00:52:54.539
You know I'm not that kind of person.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.409
Sir, I would never just run off.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.079
I promise on my life. I really mean it.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.180
"Promise?"

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.279
You know what I don't believe in? Promises. You hear me?

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.749
And I trust people even less.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:04.989
Absolutely not. Now get out.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.489
Manager, please.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:09.059
I just have nowhere else to turn.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.059
Quiet! Get out! Go on. Get back to work.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.790
Get out!

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.280
What brings you here?

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.620
I doubt you came just to check on me.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.590
Uncle.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.630
The money you borrowed from my dad...

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.260
Could you please pay it back?

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.460
What?

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.430
You people in this family...

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.070
are always harping on about that money.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.439
Your mother came here and made a scene...

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.610
when your brother started college.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.080
I already paid that money back. How many times must I tell you?

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.110
But you didn't.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.720
We know everything.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:13.920
Then...

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.790
Lend me some money, then.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:18.690
I promise I'll pay you back.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:23.130
My mom was in an accident, and her cart was destroyed.

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:24.869
She's hurt, too.

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.840
But she's refusing to even go to the hospital.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.770
I'll pay you back.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.840
I promise I'll find a way to pay you back someday.

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.910
Business has been slow for us lately.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.050
We're completely tapped out...

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.380
of money.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.179
And frankly...

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.720
Your mother is the one who cut us off in the first place.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.189
She ghosts us on the holidays without so much as a phone call.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:51.690
But you only show up when you need money.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.540
Here. Take this for bus fare.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.630
Gosh. What on earth happened?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.430
I'm fine, really.

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.670
You silly goose.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.439
If it's raining, you could at least buy a cheap umbrella.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.209
What are you doing, wandering around in the rain?

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:35.810
You're going to catch a cold.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.480
Oh, no.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.679
And what on earth happened to your nails?

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.720
What's this here?

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:46.450
I'm a total wreck, aren't I?

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.660
Just hold still. I'll go find a bandage for that.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.660
It's always one thing after another with you, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.529
The housemother is already complaining...

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.270
that our room's deposits are always short.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.239
So don't you dare get sick and miss work.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.670
You'll be dead meat.

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:04.370
The rest of you, get to bed!

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.380
Listen to Hae Ja, girls.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.409
How on earth did you get so hurt?

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:12.550
I'm okay.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.810
If all those stars were money,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.210
I'd stay up all night,

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.020
whatever it takes,

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:52.450
and I'd pick them all,

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:56.420
every last one.

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.120
What are you up to?

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.660
Come on in.

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:32.430
What are you doing, Ms. Koh?

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.429
It's not like you're exercising under the moonlight.

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:35.560
Why the cleaning?

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.469
I probably won't want to do it at dawn tomorrow,

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.500
so I'm doing it now.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600
Right.

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.770
Cleaning at 4 am is no joke.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.940
I'm still going to wait until tomorrow, though.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:09.100
You're upset about your mom's accident, aren't you?

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.810
I guess you don't know I have superpowers.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.680
The truth is...

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.980
I'm an alien from a star called Andromeda.

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:26.780
And that's why...

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.080
I can see right through what humans are thinking.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.190
- Really? - Yes.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.920
Or so I'd like to say, but...

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.830
I just don't have the energy for it today.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.970
Then how did you know?

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.870
Just a lucky guess.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.320
Here.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.420
What's this for?

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.620
It's a gift.

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.230
You gave me one, too.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.930
It might not look like much,

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:18.230
but he's a pretty hefty guy.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.190
I can't...

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.790
Use this to get your mom a new cart.

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.030
I'm not just giving it to you, though.

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.360
It's a loan.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.770
You can pay me when you're a teacher and you get your first paycheck.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.799
And I won't charge you interest.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.539
No, I can't take this.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.599
How can I possibly take this much money from you?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.710
Just take it.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.210
This is what this money is for.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.239
End of discussion.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.779
Jong Hee, but really...

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.280
Come on. Just take it.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.020
Fine. Then, as a bonus, I'm putting one favor in the bank.

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.020
And you have to grant it, no matter what. Okay?

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.060
But still, I can't take it.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.000
Take it.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.030
I'll be hurt if you don't.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.340
If it makes you feel better,

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.340
then you can pay me back a certain amount each month.

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:48.290
Hey.

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:49.790
What is it?

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.330
Koh Yeong Rye. Are you crying?

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:54.730
I'm not crying. It's just the rain.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.100
The rain stopped a while ago.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.400
Gosh. Koh Yeong Rye.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.400
You're easy. All it takes is a little money?

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:09.440
That's right. I can be bought. I love money.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.650
What are you going to do about it?

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.300
But seriously...

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.500
After going through all this,

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.510
I realized you absolutely have to have money.

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.780
It was a real wake-up call.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.550
What if Mom...

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.660
had been seriously hurt?

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.100
Money's a scary thing, isn't it?

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.730
You're just figuring that out now?

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.320
You know.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.889
I've started keeping a diary lately.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.620
With the fountain pen you gave me.

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:29.790
And guess what?

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.660
You know what I find myself writing the most?

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.430
"Did something with Yeong Rye."

01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:38.000
"It was fun."

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.670
"I laughed so hard. I was happy."

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.710
I was never the kind of person who used words like that.

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.640
But thanks to you, life's gotten a little more fun.

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:54.550
So, you see...

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:58.490
That doesn't even compare.

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.230
You're giving me something so much more valuable.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.110
That was a little...

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.240
cheesy, Seo Jong Hee.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.380
I know.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.420
I regretted it the second I said it.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.910
This is my favorite song.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.959
- So full of love - So full of love

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.389
- You and I alone - You and I alone

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:17.029
- Where and as what - Where and as what

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:20.570
- Shall we meet again - Shall we meet again

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:45.760
(Yeong Sik's Horse Rides)

01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:48.430
Gosh. This beauty is just gleaming.

01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:51.770
It's much more handsome than the last one.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.900
This must've cost a fortune.

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.800
Did you really get a paycheck advance for this?

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.070
What's gotten into him? That cheapskate personnel manager.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.279
- Well... - Well, Yeong Rye...

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.980
is just that good at her job.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.079
It'd be a huge loss for them if she went to another company.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.580
So they're just buttering her up.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.680
Well, at least he knows a good thing when he sees it.

01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:14.390
I can get right back out there and start working tomorrow. Right?

01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:15.990
- Mom. - Mom.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.889
No way. What are you talking about, business?

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.199
You need to rest all this week. You can go out next week.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.529
Nonsense.

01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:25.400
I'm stir-crazy from not working for a few days.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.029
I'm perfectly fine.

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:31.109
What do you mean, "perfectly fine?" You look like you should be in bed.

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.309
Hurry up and go rest. I'll get your bed ready.

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:34.739
- Come on. Go on. - Honestly. Don't fuss.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.549
- Go on. Get inside. - Hey, you little brat.

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:39.850
When did you get so strong? Oh, my gosh.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.780
- I told you I'm fine! - Get in.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.060
Yeong Rye told me.

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.900
Thank you. I promise I'll pay you back.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.430
Please. Don't worry about paying me back.

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:00.370
You two really are siblings, aren't you?

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.070
It's not like I need the money right away.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.680
If you really insist on paying it back,

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.350
you can play rock-paper-scissors with Yeong Rye for it.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.580
I was a step too late.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:30.800
Okay. Pencils down!

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.670
Hands on your heads.

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:34.840
Person in the last row, pass the answer sheets forward.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.340
The answer...

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.180
Here.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.920
My bad neck always flares up around exam time.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.379
Maybe from sleeping with my head on the desk all the time?

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.390
Here?

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.019
- Right there. That's the spot. - Goodness.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.219
That's something to be proud of.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.289
Hey! You're messing up my hair.

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:58.360
You have no idea how much work I put into this this morning.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.060
It's so sticky.

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.260
What is this? Did you use mousse?

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.130
- Of course I did. - Why?

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:07.999
Because, as I've already announced,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.640
today is our last big blind date of senior year.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.769
So you're coming, right?

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:14.479
I made it very clear I'm not going. You go on your own.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.580
Come on. Hey.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.410
Can't you do this one little thing for your friend?

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:19.950
The numbers are already set!

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.920
My handsome and cool friend, who's also super loyal. Jae Pil.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.390
Brother!

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.719
So now I'm your brother? You say that when you want a favor.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.389
- I'm begging you. - No.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.359
- Please, just for an hour! - Let go.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.360
Please, just for one hour!

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.300
- Gosh. - I'll owe you big. Just one hour.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:40.470
You're driving me nuts. Brother!

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.339
Please.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.339
So Yeong and Jeong Hui were supposed to go,

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.409
but they bailed when they got tickets for "Music Top Ten."

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:49.609
You got to help me out, just this once.

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:52.179
It's a 4-on-4 date. How can only 2 of us show up?

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.179
No way. I hate these things.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.349
I know, right? It's always a bunch of losers.

01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:58.289
But they said one of them is very popular.

01:11:58.290 --> 01:11:59.689
For real!

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.389
- I told you no. - You go by yourself then.

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:03.490
Look...

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.129
I'll give you my MyMy.

01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:07.630
You two can listen to music on it.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.530
- Please. - It's a cassette player.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.570
This kind of deal between friends is not exactly proper.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.770
How many people bailed on this blind date, you said?

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:19.109
- Two? - Two.

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:20.370
Okay.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.649
We'll take their spots.

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:27.049
Seo Jong Hee! What are you talking about?

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:28.920
We have class.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.400
A group date? No way.

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:45.429
No way.

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:46.929
No way. That's out of the question.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.670
Why is it out of the question?

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:50.700
I always wanted to try one of those group dates.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.569
Let's just do it while we have the chance. Okay?

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:55.010
Then what about our class?

01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.480
And besides...

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.880
I don't feel right about going and pretending to be a day student.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.350
Why? I think it sounds fun.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:06.220
And Ju Gyeong said she could lend us the uniforms.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.119
Let's do it, Yeong Rye. Please?

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.460
No. I can't do it.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.630
You know I'm a terrible liar.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.560
- I can't. - Hey.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.500
You only get better at lying with practice.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.340
Come on. Please?

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.370
Okay, fine.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.040
Then I'm cashing in that favor right now.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.080
You know, the wish I've been saving, the one you promised you'd grant?

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.079
You haven't forgotten, have you?

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.720
But that's...

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:52.770
- Hey. - What?

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.230
One hour. That's it.

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.039
We're here for one hour, tops. Then I'm off to boxing.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.870
Fine. Suit yourself.

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.110
You can just sit there and look pretty.

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.880
After all, your only job...

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.210
is to be the eye candy that brings up our average.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.590
Hey. They're here.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.330
(A Hundred Memories)

01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:17.419
- I had fun today. - Bye!

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.750
Hey. They're just leaving like this?

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.619
Are you planning to ask them on another date?

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.659
What?

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:24.830
I have a great idea.

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:26.390
What are you up to?

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.659
A boxing gym event?

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.199
They asked me to tell you they really want to invite you.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.569
The handsome one.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.370
He is the one who is into Yeong Rye.

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:35.969
(What's on your mind? Are you thinking of Han Jae Pil?)

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:37.800
I'm sure it's not like that.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:39.770
Are you coming today?

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:41.479
- Hi. - Hi.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.509
Let's go.

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:43.539
It'll be fun.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.080
(Giant Boxing Gym)

01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:53.790
Stop it!

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.520
Stop it.
