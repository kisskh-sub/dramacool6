I don't care how long ago or why it happened.

I'll never forgive anyone who hurts you, Kotori-san.

No, no, it's not like that!

We found out misunderstandings were on both sides.

I'm glad I opened up to you.

You're always the one saving me, Soma-kun.

Let me treat you to something delicious in return.

What do you want to eat?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.593
Kotori, we're making yakisoba (Stir-fried noodles).

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:39.626
I'll be right there!

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.926

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.420
This part here bothers me a little.
[Avaz]

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.280
Thanks for helping today.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.480
We're short-handed so you're a huge help.

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:11.984
- We're glad to be here.
- Glad to help.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:15.786
Can you start setting out samples?

00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:17.453
- I got it!
- Me, too.

00:14:17.453 --> 00:14:19.353
Thanks.

00:14:19.353 --> 00:14:24.097
Could you grab the extras from over there?

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:25.331
- Okay.
- Shall we line them up?

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.186
- Right.
- Yes, please do.

00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:29.653
- Over here.
- Let's line them up.

00:14:29.653 --> 00:14:31.986
- This looks better.
- Really? You're so meticulous.

00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:34.241
Then let's do it like this.

00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:37.176
We're spacing them evenly, right?

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:39.391
- Wait a second! Like this.
- What?

00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:41.453
It's going to fall. Watch out.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:46.564
Looks good. Let's go with this.

00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:48.989
We should move them a little.

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:51.010
Yes, you're right.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.353
Do we still have more?

00:14:52.353 --> 00:14:54.453
New protein drink from Avaz!

00:14:54.453 --> 00:14:57.420
Please come and try it out!

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.086
Try one?

00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:01.116
New protein drink from Avaz.

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:02.210
Try one?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.553
- I'd like one.
- Oh, thank you!

00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:06.786
Would you mind filling out a questionnaire?

00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:09.986
Sure. Thank you.

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:11.620
This way.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.486
Ogata-san is great at reeling in customers.

00:15:15.486 --> 00:15:18.120
She and Takamine-san are in sync, too.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.253
Did you hear they were high school classmates?

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:24.553
Really? What a coincidence!

00:15:24.553 --> 00:15:28.220
I bet they handed out flyers in high school.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.796
Probably.

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:31.597
Maybe they're dating...

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.720
- So what if they were classmates?
- I'm sure they're having fun.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.200
Looks like they're reliving their youth.

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:44.020
Here.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.686
Is that how you treat a customer?

00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:51.553
Sorry.

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:54.586
Why that face?

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.620
I always look like this.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.220
What?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.720
Cute face, big ego, right?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.886
- No.
- Whatever, Mr. Handsome.

00:16:03.886 --> 00:16:06.953
Please excuse his rudeness!

00:16:06.953 --> 00:16:11.620
As an apology, would you like a new protein drink?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.953
- "Drink"?
- Yes!

00:16:13.953 --> 00:16:16.220
The chocolate one is especially good.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.420
I'm drinking it to lose weight.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.086
As if protein can fix all this here.

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:26.530
It's good for diets and workouts,

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.286
but it helps with nutrition.

00:16:29.286 --> 00:16:30.453
"Nutrition"?

00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:33.486
Yes, easy, affordable health.

00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:36.920
She's just started drinking Avaz products

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.686
to know how customers feel.

00:16:40.686 --> 00:16:44.320
Leave it to me! Ready to try?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.586
This way, please.

00:16:45.586 --> 00:16:46.753
Oh, all right.

00:16:46.753 --> 00:16:50.220
It really does wonders for your health.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.620
Perfectly in sync.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.186
- They saved your life, Soma-kun.
- Yes.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.110
I see.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.820
- Feel free to hold it.
- Thank you.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.200
I feel you have to drink your protein, but...

00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:10.939
Ogata-san?

00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:15.739
I'm really sorry.

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:20.173
It's okay. Takamine-kun jumped in, too.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720
He always communicated well.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.850
Everyone would go to him for help.

00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:31.168
I see...

00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:37.077
You can mix it with other drinks you like.

00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:51.820
- Thanks so much for helping today!
- Thank you.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.553
You helped get many survey responses.

00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:55.020
Glad we could help.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.586
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

00:17:56.586 --> 00:17:59.786
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:03.286
- We worked a lot.
- I know, right?

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:05.153
A beer would hit the spot.

00:18:05.153 --> 00:18:08.086
- We drink it every day, though.
- Well, yes, still.

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:09.753
I'm going for drinks now.

00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:12.653
- Nice. Have a good one.
- I'll get going first.

00:18:12.653 --> 00:18:15.020
- Have fun.
- See you!

00:18:22.153 --> 00:18:26.053
Hey. Are you almost done, too?

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:33.020
So... Can we talk when you're done?

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.953
Sorry, I still have stuff to do. Go ahead without me.

00:18:37.953 --> 00:18:42.720
- I'll help.
- It's okay. I'll do it alone.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.953
Good night.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.786
Why is Soma-kun being cold again?

00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:08.420
Ogata.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.920
All done?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.353
Thanks so much for helping today.

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:16.353
Likewise. Thanks for letting us help.

00:19:16.353 --> 00:19:18.520
Are you free now?

00:19:19.586 --> 00:19:22.420
Well...

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.520
Is it Soma-san?

00:19:26.238 --> 00:19:30.353
Well... Um...

00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:34.286
No need to hide it. I can tell by your face.

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:36.920
But is everything okay?

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.753
I can listen if you're worried.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.086
No, it's okay.

00:19:48.886 --> 00:19:51.420
Drinks another time?

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.520
Good night.

00:20:02.653 --> 00:20:06.886
- The number you dialed...
- Why isn't he picking up?

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.653
Soma-kun! Wait up!

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.186
Is something wrong?

00:20:17.186 --> 00:20:20.960
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:20:21.786 --> 00:20:27.286
Remember how you told me to lean on you more?

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:31.586
The same goes for you now.

00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:36.620
If something's wrong, don't bottle it up, tell me.

00:20:39.753 --> 00:20:42.450
I'm younger than you,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.480
and I'm not smooth like Takamine-san.

00:20:46.408 --> 00:20:51.986
To you, I may not be very reliable.

00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:56.640
But I don't want to

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.250
give you up to anyone!

00:21:01.153 --> 00:21:06.453
- I want you to fall in love with only me.
- I love you, Soma-kun!

00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:08.453
I love you!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.286
So...

00:21:13.353 --> 00:21:15.920
No more trial period.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.886
Please be my boyfriend!

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.770
Of course.

00:21:36.537 --> 00:21:38.820
Soma-kun...

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.290
I panicked.

00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:46.953
I thought he might take you.

00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:54.886
I'm sorry I was so cold to you.

00:21:55.986 --> 00:22:00.286
I had no idea I could feel this jealous.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.153
I just didn't know how to face you.

00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:10.153
It's okay.

00:22:10.153 --> 00:22:16.553
I'm sorry I made you get the wrong idea.

00:22:19.386 --> 00:22:23.353
Can I kiss you?

00:22:28.048 --> 00:22:29.480
Sure.

00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:33.730
I love you,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.586
Kotori-san.

00:22:39.153 --> 00:22:40.986
I love you, too.

00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:58.486
I don't want to leave you yet.

00:22:58.486 --> 00:23:00.686
Do you have plans after this?

00:23:02.253 --> 00:23:04.153
No.

00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:08.040
I'd like to stay with you longer.

00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:12.586
Then can I come over?

00:23:14.953 --> 00:23:17.086
To your place.

00:23:18.253 --> 00:23:19.920
Wait, wait!

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.750
We've only just made this official!

00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:26.391
And he's coming to my place already?

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.253
I wonder what he meant by "after that."

00:24:34.253 --> 00:24:36.953
I'm new to dating so I need time to prepare myself.

00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:38.753
-I'm a newbie, too.
- What?

00:24:38.753 --> 00:24:44.860
Things are finally official, but what do I do now?
