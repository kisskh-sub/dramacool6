The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.160
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.960
Let's talk

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.390
You went there that day

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.260
You're going to get Bafron, right?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.460
I have no comment

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.690
The supplier will not sit idly by.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.260
If you tell me about the drug dealer

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.660
The police will also keep it confidential

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.120
I will help you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660
Then can you agree to my terms?

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.860
I will cooperate only if you promise me

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.160
The bag you gave me last time

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.260
It was taken away by Dr. Yu

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.760
It was donated by him personally.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.560
This is Representative Gu Kwang-chul

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.360
Yu Suzhen is about to euthanize someone

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.260
This is the day the client has been waiting for.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.960
So don't try to interfere.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.060
Don't try to convince Yu Suzhen

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.460
If you mess around

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.260
You're really going to die this time.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.310
Yu Suzhen is also not safe

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.610
If you and Suzhen both want to do this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.920
Please bring the medicine to the scene in person that day

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.920
Why

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.960
I can just give the medicine to the client in advance.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.960
You tell Yu Suzhen that the client will send the medicine.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.560
Then you bring the medicine yourself.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.210
Then Suzhen will understand

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.390
There's no such thing as you

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.220
Absolutely impossible

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.720
Makes sense

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.520
Good idea

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.510
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.790
This isn't just your problem.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.460
It's also true that we're in constant danger if you don't stop.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.140
I'm going too

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.320
Let's go together

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.020
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun said he would cooperate with the investigation

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.890
He said he would bring in bugs and cameras.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260
Yu Suzhen, the main culprit

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.790
Choi Dae-hyun's accomplice

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.260
Just get rid of the drug circulation.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.660
Well, that's the only way.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.990
I'll go in with a bug, but

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.990
The main culprit must be me

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.490
Suzhen tried it for the first time that day

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.230
Everything before

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.920
I did it all

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.190
And that day

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.220
The drug dealer

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.320
You must arrest him

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.890
And please keep your promise

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.690
anyway

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.520
I will always keep my promise

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.020
I'll do it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
Just stay by my side

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.090
What about Bafron?

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.960
Why didn't you see it?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.920
Wait until Yu Suzhen is ready

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.520
The drug dealer will deliver it to his home personally

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.090
This time we plan to arrest the drug dealers on the spot.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.060
Why not answer

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.220
nothing

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.320
-Hello. -Yeah.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.060
If I didn't show up, you would have died there.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.960
Is it okay? No

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.980
Yes, it's better for you to die there.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.590
That's easier, right?

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.060
What's up?

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.190
Feel sorry

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.480
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.390
-=Episode 10=-

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.310
What the hell? Did he cover the picture with his clothes?

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.280
The bug was exposed

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.590
-=Just say you are tired=-

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.920
You just say you are tired

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.660
I'm a little tired today

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.860
That's all for today's consultation.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.860
-Okay. -Okay.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.260
That's better

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.420
Then today I will just write the consultation record

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.060
Choi Dae-hyun

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.520
You crazy person

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.820
Do you think I'm funny?

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.020
This guy is really

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.590
-Team Leader -Do you know what you are doing?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.690
What are you doing?

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.440
Yu Suzhen, what are you doing?

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.930
I'm in consultation

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.690
-=Consultation Record=-

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.730
The patient wants to be transferred to a hospice

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.190
Filling out documents

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.360
I'm leaving now.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.490
Where do you want to go?

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.490
Doctor consulting patient

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.620
Is it worth the police being so excited?

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.760
like...

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.940
There seems to be some misunderstanding

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.890
It's me

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.390
Please ask Dr. Yu to come to my house

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.460
I don't know why you came to visit.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.660
Please apologize to both of you before you leave.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.160
- I'm leaving now. - Okay.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.290
- Please take your time. - Okay.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.020
Agreed to cooperate

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.030
Are you kidding us?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.220
Because I want to catch the drug dealers as well.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.990
I let him go to the scene

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.230
But they knew about it in advance and ran away.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.660
Things are messed up

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.620
What did you do without permission?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.260
I was the one who first proposed this to Choi Dae-hyun.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.690
sorry

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.420
Why don't you report it to me?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.390
You don't even believe me.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.790
Is that why things turned out like this?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.290
I messed it up.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.820
Just arrest me.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.580
Hello

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.090
Shut up

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.860
Please arrest Choi Dae-hyun!

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.820
I'm no longer Choi Dae-hyun's lawyer

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.560
He lied to the police and his own lawyer.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.820
Arrest him.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.290
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.260
You messed with the wrong person

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.260
I will do whatever I want to Yu Suzhen now

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.160
Because I'm no longer your lawyer.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.860
lawyer

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.860
If facts learned during the defense are disclosed

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.660
Illegal

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.390
Right

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.820
Do you know the law well?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.330
Defend yourself later.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.260
Don't you feel ashamed?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.060
It's obviously all your fault.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.060
But you pushed it all to Choi Dae-hyun

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.090
As a lawyer, don't you feel ashamed to cooperate with the police in sting operations?

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.960
Why are you so confident?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.060
Well, it doesn't matter if my friend dies like that.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.760
Is it right to abandon it?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.340
Choi Dae-hyun

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.860
Now in the police interrogation room

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.420
It was Daxian who cooperated with the police

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.960
I can't take this responsibility

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.580
I

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.290
As Choi Dae-hyun's lawyer, I have been patient.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.490
I won't tolerate it anymore.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.290
There's a murderer living next door.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.990
How can I just sit back and watch?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.790
And the children

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.490
Are you threatening me?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.920
Even if the principle of attorney confidentiality is ridiculous

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.530
My daughter must be compensated for the injuries she suffered.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.490
Don't touch the child

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.010
Let's see

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.960
See what the results are

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.090
Ordered from above

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.560
Suspected of drug abuse

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.320
Immediately arrest Choi Dae-hyun for botching the investigation

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.290
If you want to avoid immediate arrest

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.260
You just have to cooperate with the police.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.260
Tell me who the drug dealer is

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.290
This is your last chance

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.260
Play tricks again

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.460
You're really going to die this time.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.410
Yu Suzhen is also not safe

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.890
Mr. Detective

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.270
Please give me another chance

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.090
Let me out

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.260
I will help you catch him no matter what.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.320
You didn't provide any clues to the drug dealer.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.590
How can I trust you?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.610
Check for people related to the deceased Chen Yingxiu

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.760
There should be someone among them who is under special protection of the police

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.410
Drug dealers police

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.460
How deeply involved are you?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.490
You'll be arrested here.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.220
But if you go out, you will be retaliated by drug dealers

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.840
Possibly life-threatening

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.380
I know I can't live a peaceful life anymore

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.290
So let me out.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.390
Let me be the bait again.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.090
I'll help you capture him no matter what.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.860
Why stop?

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.020
Why stop?

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.990
The police noticed

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.790
Became suspicious

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.890
When can it be done?

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.460
Police have been monitoring Park Tae-hyung and his wife

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.190
Should euthanasia be performed at this time?

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.990
It's too dangerous. I'm hesitant.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.820
I

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.920
Double the pledge amount

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.060
I'll give you double

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.920
So please deal with it as soon as possible

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.690
- Twice? - Yes.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.220
Our lawyer Park, I checked

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.090
You borrowed a huge loan at high interest rates.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.720
The interest is not a small amount.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.920
I'll help you solve it

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.860
but

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.860
I'll give you half of the inheritance

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.320
knew

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.390
Got it, hurry up...

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.490
Please process quickly

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.160
OK Deal

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.290
This is tomorrow's morning paper.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.120
-=A senior police officer in Basin City accepted bribes to settle a case=-

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.820
I told you, you don't have much time.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.610
The next report will use real names

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.790
Before that, please leave that place yourself.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.890
You guy...

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.320
Have you been recording?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.960
Although I am only here thanks to you, Councillor

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.290
But you can get to this point

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.390
Some of it is my credit.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.820
In case you may not remember

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.090
I can play it for you

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.190
Are you threatening me?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.120
How dare I threaten you?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.270
During this period, although I have done a lot of research according to your instructions,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.860
But according to your instructions, there is more to cover up

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.420
Too much backlog

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.420
I'm also under pressure

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.690
you

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.100
Because the report has not yet released the real name

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.210
So it doesn't feel real yet?

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.350
Then publish your real name.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.970
So I'll hold a press conference.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.180
Because I am a person who is afraid of loneliness

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.610
So even if I die, I have to take someone with me.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.480
Look at your current attitude. Have you already paved the way for retreat?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.860
We all agreed to die together

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.540
What other back roads do I need to pave?

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.230
I'm just asking you solemnly for the last time.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.960
Please follow the agreement

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.320
Give me some more time

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.080
No wonder they say we shouldn't cultivate ambitious people.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.650
Please give me some more time

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.230
Please

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.050
But I have a condition

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.510
You can go out, but wear this.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.510
Dr. Yu

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.050
Can I see you again?

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.010
Can

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.150
sorry

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.820
I'm more angry than you lying to me.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.950
You deceived the patient.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.650
Well, maybe I'm crazy.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.830
You know how long the suffering patients have been waiting for us.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.290
Don't you know how desperate Park Tae-hyung is right now?

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.220
But I think Gu Kwang-chul has put us all in danger.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.990
I'm only thinking about how to catch Gu Kwang-chul

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.160
No consideration for others

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.000
Sorry, I didn't think it through.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.200
We haven't met recently.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.340
Wait a moment

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.290
I have something to tell you

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.410
I don't want to talk to you now

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.380
I don't want to hear any of your excuses.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.360
I'm leaving

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.090
We meet again, Detective Pan

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.360
Why are you here?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.880
This is my uncle's house.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.890
Are you his nephew?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.000
Any questions?

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.710
Park Tae-hyung and his wife were suspected to be present at the euthanasia scene.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.220
We're here to investigate.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.310
Please help

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.450
I refuse

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.360
First, you have no warrant, and second, no evidence.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.120
They are already in poor health, so we can't make them more tired.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.250
We just want to be admitted to the hospice ward

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.300
I asked Dr. Yu for help.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.420
Also, it seems like you came in without permission yesterday.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.440
I can charge you with trespassing.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.430
My uncle's condition worsened.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.900
I went in first

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.110
Let's go, auntie

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.330
People involved in Chen Yingxiu's death

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.840
All require more careful and in-depth investigation

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.560
Talk to Captain An.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.020
Go to Gu Guangzhe's office to seize the search warrant

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.150
Why do this?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.410
The office used by Chen Yingxiu during his lifetime

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.050
Now Gu Guangzhe is using it intactly.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.920
It is necessary to confirm

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.490
The seizure and search warrant for Koo Kwang-chul's office was not approved.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.630
I've said this before

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.520
Representative Gu Guangzhe is a businessman who is close to Councillor Baek

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.250
Chen Yingxiu's lawyer was also involved in the failed euthanasia attempt.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.500
Park Tae-hyung's nephew

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.270
It must have a deep connection with the Yu Suzhen case.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.450
Then the building of Chen Yingxiu under the name of Gu Guangzhe

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.880
It can be seen as a trade-off

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.400
If you have any doubts, start investigating your nephew.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.870
Don't conduct random seizures and searches

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.880
What will become of my reputation if you do this?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.040
Find someone related to the late Chen Yingxiu

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.510
There must be people among them who are under special protection by the police.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.880
Everything has been peaceful since the last time the police came.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.920
Dr. Yu, are you okay?

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.990
I'm fine

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.340
If you have any questions, please contact me

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.410
good

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.120
Our nurse Choi Ye-na is also doing it

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.500
That thing that Dr. Yu Suzhen did?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.140
right

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.720
How did she seduce you into doing that with her?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.260
It wasn't something Dr. Yu suggested.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.820
I was the one who approached her and suggested doing this.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.160
Why

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.320
Initially due to lack of money

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.430
Later

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.490
I think people really need this

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.940
How do you determine if they need it?

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.490
My family is struggling in pain

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.300
But I can't do anything, do you understand?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.100
Even if it's just for a moment

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.800
I also want him to be relieved from the pain. This is what the family thinks.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.950
We cannot fully know the Lord’s will.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.860
When do you think you can accomplish this?

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.380
As long as I can do

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.640
I will do my best

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.120
Cai Yan came to see me in the morning

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.160
Saying that Youmei is isolating herself

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.070
Only listen to Cai Yan's one side of the story

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.330
Sending your child to the school violence committee is inappropriate.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.910
One is the Department of Fine Arts and the other is the Department of Dance

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.460
It's not a relationship where we meet often.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.070
After listening to what the children said

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.930
I think Youmei is indeed isolated.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.380
Then confirm the monitoring

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.170
Discovering beauty, not letting anyone get close to Cai Yan

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.700
If I get involved in school violence recently, it will be difficult for me to go to college.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.680
If you want to avoid forced transfer

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.610
You need to have a serious talk with Jae-yeon's aunt

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.600
-=Park, the police came=-

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.280
Hello

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.160
It will continue today

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.280
Park Tae-hyung and his wife will die today

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.790
It's under investigation now. It's dangerous to do this.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.460
That's why I called you in advance.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.880
We will deal with the death of that couple naturally.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.200
How are you going to finish it? Be more prepared.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.660
husband

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.310
I saw a bird

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.380
It was so beautiful that I followed it.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.490
Be patient

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.130
Hello

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.700
The doctor said to come back today

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.200
Dr. Yu, there's a delivery for you.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.280
Who sent it?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.230
It only has your name on it

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.600
-=Yu Suzhen=-

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.190
Did you receive what I sent?

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.610
Not such a hot photo

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.960
very beautiful

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.010
It's so beautiful I can't bear to look at it myself

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.310
I wish I could watch it with the people in the hospital.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.060
What exactly are you planning to do?

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.710
Stop pretending, Yu Suzhen

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.090
That detective and Choi Dae-hyun

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.440
They can't protect you.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.110
Brother, I will protect you

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.160
I know you're getting off work.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.590
Come to Park Tae-hyung's house

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.840
I don't need your protection.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.160
I love you

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.460
I have something to tell you

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.190
The house is full of children

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.690
I have to take care of them

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.510
I'll wait for you at the art shop in front of the station.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.760
You said you were going out to buy some paint.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.610
Why should I listen to you?

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.590
You must come out

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.140
Otherwise you will regret it

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.640
What's this

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.160
I heard your aunt

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.490
A suspect in a murder case

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.340
It seems that my mother's law firm hired a defense lawyer.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.740
How did you get this video?

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.640
I will keep it a secret

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.110
You canceled reporting my school violence incident

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.040
If what you said is true, my aunt is really a suspect.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.140
I've entrusted your mother to defend me.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.690
Your mother is also in danger.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.710
Do you think I will be deceived by you?

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.560
You know lawyers have a duty of confidentiality, right?

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.590
If you leak the video and it becomes known

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.360
Your mother's legal career is over.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.860
Are you crazy?

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.510
you

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.840
If you show this video to other people

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.790
I won't give up either.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.940
Luo Youmei

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.240
You don't believe it now, right?

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.840
So is it true or false?

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.960
Call your aunt and my mother to confirm

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.740
Now that it has come to this

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.190
Both of them have to be present.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.440
What are you doing?

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.590
sorry

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.460
I will ask my parents to make compensation.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.590
What

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.290
Excuse me

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.190
You are Caiyan, right?

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.810
So what?

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.960
Yeah, your aunt's boyfriend.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.610
Not me

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.690
I'm just a male friend.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.710
Sorry, I'll compensate you.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.390
Sorry, please use this to pay.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.660
you

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.510
Be more careful next time

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.660
There are a lot of things here that could break, and it could be a disaster.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.760
Is she really her aunt's friend?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.690
If not, why should I compensate you?

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.410
I'm not a philanthropist.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.310
Or you

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.940
I need to change my temper.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.510
The world is not centered around you

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.210
What the hell are you talking about?

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.710
Cai Yan

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.860
Aunt

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.090
I accidentally broke something in the art store.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.110
No injuries, right?

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.110
No

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.790
But your friend in the art store

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.510
Compensated us

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.040
My friend?

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.540
that

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.560
It's me

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.690
Don't touch the children

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.260
You didn't seem to understand what I just said.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.840
I'll say it again

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.260
Park Tae-hyung

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.360
It's so uncomfortable now

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.190
So if you can

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.960
I hope you go to that house right away.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.660
Send the child home

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:46.640
You also come to Park Tae-hyung's house

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.060
See you later

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.240
I know your aunt very well.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.240
doctor

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.690
husband

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.790
Doctor Yu is here

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.240
Were you injured by the vision?

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.210
Yes

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.860
but

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.740
It's okay

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.390
Now

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.290
Dr. Yu, you're here.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.190
Please help us, Dr. Yu

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.360
Help them

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.360
Look how sincere they are.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.990
I've prepared a suicide note and sleeping pills.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.360
She told others that her husband died of illness.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.660
A wife is overwhelmed with grief over her husband's death

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.490
Wrote a suicide note

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.190
Very neat, right?

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.260
Pei Meiying is not good enough

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.640
Don't kill healthy people out of sadness

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.560
The choice is ours

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.790
You just follow the instructions.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.360
No matter what you say, Pei Meiying just can't do it

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.340
She is in good health

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.960
I can't kill someone like this.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.110
This goes against my principles.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.060
Get started now

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.960
No matter how you disguise it as suicide

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.340
If Pei Meiying died

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.060
You may also be investigated

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.510
You are the heir

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.910
So I am suspected before anyone else.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.290
OK

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.410
Just do it

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.990
Please only do it for my husband.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.010
Wife

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.760
fine

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.440
I'm fine

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.110
Dr. Yu

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.360
Please just help my husband.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.590
Promise it

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.860
Please give us time to say goodbye

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:36.210
I've been sick all my life.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.410
Thank you for always taking care of me

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.640
If it weren't for you

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.190
I won't live to this age.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.390
Thanks to you

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.160
I live well

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.260
Thank you

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.040
sorry

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.590
The rest of life

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.190
I'm responsible for it myself.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.890
I will live a good life

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.640
Don't worry

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.790
us

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.460
See you soon

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.260
He is already dead

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.490
Are you sure?

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.690
Pei Meiying was not mentioned before.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.210
So what? You're just a murderer.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.360
Wait

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.960
He's already on his way. There's no need to get so emotional.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.460
Calm down

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:03.440
besides

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.890
As you wished, Pei Meiying is not dead.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.760
Yu Suzhen, don't be so exaggerated.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.710
Calm down! Calm down!

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.390
Is that why you need me?

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.590
To kill normal people?

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.510
Yu Suzhen, it's all over.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.630
Is it all over?

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.830
No problem

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.510
Pei Meiying suddenly committed suicide by jumping off a building

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.890
She's dead

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.340
This is not the way we agreed before.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.240
There is a suicide note

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.750
The method of suicide changed from taking sleeping pills to jumping off a building

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.180
No one would doubt it

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.650
So you wait for the police to come.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.740
Just finish it

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.610
Got it?

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.940
Damn

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.260
OK, got it.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.970
Brother Zhixun

00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:59.670
Um

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.080
Park Tae-hyung and his wife died

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.100
What does this mean?

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.690
Tell me what happened

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.800
Don't hang around here.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.320
Sorry, please go upstairs.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.240
I heard your uncle passed away.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.380
who

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.560
Manage your facial expressions well

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.170
You are the chief mourner, so you should look sad.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.560
what to do

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.150
what to do

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.900
What's going on?

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.890
Judging from the current situation, it was after her husband passed away due to illness.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.080
The wife made an extreme choice

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.940
That was a suicide note written in advance.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.030
Are you waiting for your husband's death?

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.220
Yes, she was wearing shoes when she jumped off the building.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.890
It must have been an impulsive act.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.200
But seeing that she left a suicide note, it seems like it was planned in advance.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.230
To further confirm

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.760
Are you sure they were the only ones home at the time?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.340
This needs to be further confirmed

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.290
How did you get here?

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.890
What is the reason for you coming here?

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.030
The bereaved family member is an acquaintance of mine

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.720
When I reported him as lawyer Chen Yingxiu

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.670
You didn't say that

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.390
You didn't mention Park Min-seong's name in your report.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.440
Then I want to know in advance even the things you didn't report.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.960
Avoiding acquaintances?

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.130
It must be a huge blow to you.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.970
We'll take care of this. Go take a break.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.220
I have a funeral coming up soon. It's going to be very hard.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.790
It doesn't matter

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.660
Deal with the scene as quickly as possible

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.730
Assist the bereaved family with funeral arrangements

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.530
Take care

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.680
Ouch, uncle

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.060
Assisted suicide suspect

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.280
-=Attending Physicians: Woo Su-jeong, Cho Soo-young, Choi Dae-hyun, Choi Ye-na=-

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.240
Woo So-jeong Choi Dae-hyun Choi Ye-na

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.550
After Jin Shijian's death, he replaced the supplier of Bafron.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:38.800
Gu Guangzhe

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.400
Jin Young-soo and Park Tae-hyung

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:41.860
-=Choi Gun-soo, Jin Young-soo, Park Tae-hyung=-

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.170
Park Min-seong, the middleman who introduced Koo Kwang-chul

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.720
-=Choi Ye-na, Park Min-seong, Koo Kwang-chul=-

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.560
as well as

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:47.950
Internal police assistants

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.220
-=Park Min-seong, Koo Kwang-chul=-

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.360
An Taicheng

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.120
The clues form a picture

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.020
-=Attending Physicians: Woo So-jeong, Cho Soo-young, Choi Dae-hyun, Kim Si-geon, Choi Ye-na, Park Min-seong, Koo Kwang-chul=-

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.600
You haven't been to the hospital for a long time, so I came to see you myself.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.260
You must be very busy. Why come here?

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.590
I can only feel relieved when I see you are okay.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.950
Next News

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.070
In a high-end apartment in Jiangnan

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.110
There was an incident where a man named Pei, who was in his sixties, fell from a building.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.710
-=Woman in her 60s fell to her death from luxury apartment building=-

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.500
The police believe that Pei was her husband Park

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.790
After dying of illness

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:25.660
Unable to withstand the blow

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.010
I jumped out of the apartment by myself.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.590
This seems to be Park Tae-hyung's apartment

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.360
Through his family, I learned that Pei usually suffers from depression.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.110
-=I discovered that I was suffering from depression...=-

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.860
Are Park Tae-hyung and his wife dead?

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.660
Are both of them dead?

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.590
Dr. Yu, you look very tired.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.300
What happened?

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:50.850
Thanks

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.430
The atmosphere in the hospital is strange lately.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.140
Dr. Yu

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.460
The patients who were brought in yesterday have all been accommodated.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.800
But there is still one person who has not decided whether to be hospitalized

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.980
I need you to go take a look

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.060
It is 65-year-old Cui Zhenjing

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.750
The next one is Pei Meiying's body

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.510
What?

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.950
Are you sure it's Bae Mi-young's body?

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.760
Because he committed suicide by jumping off a building

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.430
So it's pretty swollen and there's a lot of bruising.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.940
You may look unfamiliar

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.310
So that's it

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.300
Please help us, Dr. Yu.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.980
Let me tell you the patient's identity again.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.130
It is 65-year-old Cui Zhenjing

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.510
A cleaner

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.760
He said he accidentally fell down while cleaning the roof.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.720
Discovered relatively late

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.380
He was sent to the emergency room after midnight.

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.710
I will temporarily serve as Cui Zhenjing's attending physician.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.890
She has no family

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.960
Let us take care of her until she regains consciousness.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:34.790
good

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.890
-=Funeral Home=-

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.680
I confirmed the body is not Bae Mi-young

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.320
What? What do you mean?

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.750
The body is not Pei Meiying

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.420
Could it be that Pei Meiying's body turned into a zombie?

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.420
Did you walk out? What do you mean?

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.120
How do I know?

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.300
Hang up first

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.110
A very young person

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.060
Zhao Xiuying was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.260
It was a case that my grandmother called the police.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.230
-=Choi Dae-hyun Choi Ye-na=-

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.550
Okay, please sit down.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.390
Our Xiuying

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.220
Went to heaven peacefully

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.330
It must be Sooyoung's grandmother who misunderstood.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.430
But I don't blame her

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.200
Because I'm not a good enough dad.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.760
That's why she doubts me.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.270
Now that someone has called the police, we're investigating.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.550
good

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.830
Do you know Dr. Yu Suzhen from Basin City General Hospital?

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.830
My son

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.620
Was hospitalized in that hospital

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.920
So maybe you've seen it.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:37.760
But why ask me

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.030
Things about that person

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.820
She is the suspect in this case.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.820
What suspicion

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.760
Suspected of euthanizing terminally ill patients

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.450
Do you know any relevant information?

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.130
-=Intensive Treatment Room=-

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.190
sorry

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.950
My mom is in a similar situation.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.560
Suffering from the same disease

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.990
Always longing for death

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.710
When I was a child

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.940
I didn't know what my mother's last wish was, so I helped her.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.340
Now it's almost twenty years

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.850
I still want to ask her

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.890
Was my choice correct at that time?

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.940
Is that really what Mom wants?

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.000
sorry

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.220
So I couldn't help you.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.630
Thank you

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.030
Let my husband

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.510
Leave peacefully

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.290
Thanks

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.900
You said you didn't want to live anymore after your husband died.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.760
I thought that sentence was too simple.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.580
sorry

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.850
I think

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.900
Rewrite the suicide note

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:15.340
Let me call everyone else over.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.450
Before that

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.890
I need your help with something.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.050
Speaking

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:29.010
Please finish me.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:43.730
Ye-na, where are you?

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.040
I need your help with something urgent.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.030
Let's talk

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.030
It's all over

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.950
Is it an emergency arrest?

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.940
Do you have a warrant for your arrest?

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:55.960
The day Choi Gun-soo died

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.800
Choi Dae-hyun wants Chen Yingxiu to die euthanasia

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.890
Got Bafron

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:03.600
Lawyer Park Min-seong also knows about this, right?

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:07.640
I don't know about this

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:09.680
If it's Daxian's fault, the police will handle it.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.730
Baflon's supplier, Gu Guangzhe

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:12.880
Don't you know this person?

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.430
I can't believe the words of someone who has lied to me so many times

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:21.550
What about Zhao Xiuying?

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.330
I went to meet the student's father

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.550
Zhao Xiuying's father Zhao Shangxian

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.260
He was investigated on suspicion of murdering his own son.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.680
Soo-young's father is innocent

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.050
If Dr. Yu Suzhen

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.240
Accused

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.900
If you kill our Xiuying

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.810
I will turn myself in.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:52.700
No

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.190
In fact, our Xiuying

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.140
I sent it away

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.060
In my arms

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.250
Are you going to make a false confession?

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.710
Why do you protect Yu Suzhen so much?

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.930
Our Xiuying

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.760
Thanks to the doctor

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.820
Confessed to my first love

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.530
And reconciled with me

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.320
Although you won't believe it

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.860
But it's really peaceful.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:32.000
Left

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.040
If I weren't a doctor,

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.900
To our Xiuying

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.500
I never got to tell him how much I loved him.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.960
police officer

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:52.840
Do you know what it's like to see a family member sick?

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.470
Our Xiuying

00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.950
Even with enough painkillers

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.400
He still feels pain.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.360
But euthanasia is a crime

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.640
Euthanasia is not the answer to all death, but

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.120
There are definitely patients who need it

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.840
That's how it is for Sooyoung

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.020
Don't resent the world in your short life

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.230
Arrange your heart

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.000
Loving someone

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.440
That's how I left

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.480
So Dr. Yu is not guilty.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.200
Please, officer.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:41.490
If you can't forgive Dr. Yu

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.700
Then punish me.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.120
Sooyoung's father

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.370
Everyone wants to protect you

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.760
You already

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.160
There's nowhere to hide

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.650
Please give me some time

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.860
Why do you call me so casually?

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.030
You're pretty brave.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.820
A client appeared

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.220
Said he would give more money than Park Tae-hyung and his wife

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.350
I need medicine

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.330
Does Yu Suzhen also know?

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.560
No, I told you first.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:44.380
Because I can't work without your permission.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:47.840
OK, let's meet

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.170
-=Representative Gu, please come to the address I sent you before midnight tonight=-

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:52.450
Come to me at the address I sent you before midnight tonight

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.720
I need medicine

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.170
Pei Meiying is still alive

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.190
I'm going there now

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.410
Pei Meiying is now in the emergency room of Basin City Hospital

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.280
You must do as I say

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.640
What should I do?

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.000
Yu Suzhen will come to get the medicine

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.600
Please wait a moment.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:20.180
Understood

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.910
The situation has become dangerous

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.630
It's starting to get out of control

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.880
I need a partner to work with

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.240
Where is Choi Dae-hyun?

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.750
He's already surrendered to the police once.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.180
Because I feel uneasy, I can no longer work together

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.800
I need someone who can help me get the medicine.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.600
And protect me from the police

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.690
You decide

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.010
I don't want to force you

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.190
Yu Suzhen

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.240
Where is Representative Gu Kwang-chul?

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.460
Representative Gu Kwang-chul

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.650
Have you got a meal yet

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:33.010
Ah, I went to the bathroom.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.040
finally

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.630
Today is your memorial day

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.400
You're dead

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.500
I'm helping you realize your wish.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.230
You are welcome to surrender to your brother.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.760
Welcome to my world

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:44.030
