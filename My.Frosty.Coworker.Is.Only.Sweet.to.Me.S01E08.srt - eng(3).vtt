What's wrong?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.686
I haven't told you something.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.630
The day you had that fever,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.500
I called my brother.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:14.020
Kotori-san will manage your site. I'll handle the system.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.653
Oh, you will?

00:16:16.653 --> 00:16:20.653
Might as well give it your all,
as it'll be your last job there.

00:16:20.653 --> 00:16:21.886
"My last job"?

00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:25.986
When this is over, you'll return to Kyoto, right?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.970
You haven't yet repaid Father for raising you.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.986
Th-Then once this is all over...

00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:39.686
No, I won't go back, never.

00:16:39.686 --> 00:16:42.053
What? You're not?

00:16:42.053 --> 00:16:47.586
That's right. I'll keep pursuing this job here.

00:16:47.586 --> 00:16:54.186
With Kotori-san, I'll build a mind-blowing site.

00:16:55.453 --> 00:17:00.520
So this job was for my benefit, too.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:06.960
I wanted to show my family my pride in my work.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.487
I'll repay them that way, as my brother said.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.535
Thank you for telling me.

00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:22.035
That honestly makes me very happy.

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:28.040
You didn't do your best only for me,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.680
but for your own sake as well.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.752
I want us each to have our own goals

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:42.752
and support each other through the process,

00:17:42.752 --> 00:17:44.952
for the rest of our lives.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.886
You warm me when I'm cold; I'll cool you when you're hot.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.752
Like that, right?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.486
Exactly.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.140
I prefer white.
[Idee]

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.220
You prefer white? I'll go with blue.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.370
Blue... I see.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.519
- Idee, Hata speaking.
- How about

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:13.852
- Oh, hello.
- this color?

00:18:13.852 --> 00:18:15.686
- Yes.
- Looks good.

00:18:15.686 --> 00:18:19.552
- Ogata? One moment, please.
- So this is the edge, right?

00:18:19.552 --> 00:18:24.119
Kotori-san, Aiya's president on line 1 for you.

00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:26.819
What? The president?

00:18:26.819 --> 00:18:28.350
Yes.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.319
Is something up?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.086
So sorry that you had to come.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:43.587
I wanted to thank you in person before I go to Kyoto.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.386
Thank me?

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:50.352
Orders pour in since the website opened.

00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:53.486
Apparently, we trend on social media as well.

00:18:53.486 --> 00:18:57.052
This is unprecedented.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.019
Is that so?

00:19:01.019 --> 00:19:03.986
Do you have a moment?

00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:05.552
Of course.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.244
I was actually always jealous of my brother.

00:19:11.244 --> 00:19:15.540
Though he was raised in the same household,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.810
why was he given more freedom?

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.700
I found myself wishing for that freedom.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.152
Now we've received orders from clients nationwide.

00:19:30.152 --> 00:19:34.119
Sweets I take pride in bring joy to so many people.

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:39.052
And I've realized, it makes me very happy, too.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.719
Yes.

00:19:41.719 --> 00:19:47.586
Aiya's sweets have made me very happy, too.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.290
These are to thank you.

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:56.419
Thank you.

00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:59.219
Farewell then.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.752
Gosh, these make me so happy!
[Dorayaki]

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:20.819
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:24.519
You take one, too, Soma-kun.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.086
But you don't like them.

00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:31.152
I'll have one, too.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.052
I think I'll like it now.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.686
All right, let's dig in!

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.986
Yummy.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.986
Our dorayaki is the best.

00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:57.819
Right?

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:08.386
But seeing your face as you eat these is the best.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.119
Oh, good.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.152
The chief gave us a couple of days off to rest.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.852
This is great.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.586
So... any ideas for our long weekend?

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:33.419
Actually, can we go to a hot spring in Hakone?

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.952
A trip?

00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:38.852
That means...

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.552
W-We're staying the night?

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.152
I actually made reservations.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.019
What do you say?

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.752
Yes, let's go.

00:21:56.752 --> 00:21:59.752
"Stay the night"? What the heck, Soma!

00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:02.119
Kairi, why...

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:05.186
Your door was unlocked. Be more careful, Nee-chan.

00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:07.786
I'll watch that, but why are you here?

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:11.919
These are Mom's thanks for the sweets you sent.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:19.019
But listen, Soma! I'm coming on this trip with you!

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:21.186
You won't lay a finger on her.

00:22:21.186 --> 00:22:22.652
Hey...

00:22:22.652 --> 00:22:25.619
Sure, go ahead. Right, Kotori-san?

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.652
Another day, another amazing tea.

00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:38.852
You think they'll bring back steamed sweet buns?

00:22:38.852 --> 00:22:41.552
I want to go see the Northern Lights.

00:22:41.552 --> 00:22:44.786
Maybe I'll go camping.

00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:46.886
I recommend Yamanashi Prefecture.

00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:48.519
Oh, the lakes, right?

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:50.019
No reservation needed.

00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:53.419
- Oh yes, they're the best!
- The best, right?

00:22:53.419 --> 00:22:54.852
- I want to go, too!
- Me, too!

00:22:54.852 --> 00:22:56.410
Take us.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.710
Let's all go.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.710
Sorry, I'm late.

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:03.380
Did you wait long?

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.500
Don't worry. I just got here.

00:23:06.502 --> 00:23:09.619
Wait, where's Kairi-san?

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.686
He went home this morning,

00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:15.586
despite what he said.

00:23:15.586 --> 00:23:16.786
Is it all fine?

00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:19.980
Yes, I'll make it up to him later.

00:23:21.086 --> 00:23:23.719
Let's go, Soma-kun.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.819
"Ryosuke."

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.732
What?

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.190
Call me by my first name.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.670
♫ What makes you laugh? ♫

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.880
♫ I want to be by your side ♫

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.819
Let's go, Ryosuke-kun.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.086
Let's go, Kotori-san.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.530
♫ Tell me I'm cute ♫

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.050
♫ I put on the lipstick that's darker than usual ♫

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.119
Can't wait to go to Hakone.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:59.419
Yes, I can't wait!

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.319
I'm glad the weather's nice.

00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:05.786
I'm warm today.

00:24:05.786 --> 00:24:08.452
- Kotori and...
- Ryosuke.

00:24:08.452 --> 00:24:11.952
- The high body temp girl...
- And the low body temp guy's...

00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:13.719
- diaries!
- diaries!

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:15.650
Welcome.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.052
Takeout, two medium coffees, please.

00:24:20.052 --> 00:24:22.219
Hot or iced?

00:24:22.219 --> 00:24:23.952
- Iced.
- Hot.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.352
- Iced. Come on!
- Hot.
