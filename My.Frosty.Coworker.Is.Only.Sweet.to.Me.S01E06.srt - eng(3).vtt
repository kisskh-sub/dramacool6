00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.314
You two met at work?

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:07.940
What a coincidence!

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.173
Maybe it's fate.

00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:14.120
What?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.606
Your Hokkaido carpaccio.

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:19.433
I got it, thanks.

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.854
Why that reaction?

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.987
No, no, it's not like that at all.

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:28.987
- Right?
- Y-Yes, right.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.920
Did Nakano-kun from our hometown really get married?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.380
Yes, he even became a dad this year.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.154
What? "A dad"?

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:40.020
Wow.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.320
Do you have someone special, Kotori?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.254
You do, yes?

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.420
Actually...

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.587
Recently...

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
I started seeing someone.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.417
- Whoa!
- Congrats!

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:06.333
What's he like? Older or younger? How long?

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.726
He's younger. We just started dating.

00:01:10.726 --> 00:01:13.487
What do you like about him?

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:16.620
Well...

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.920
I can't really put it into words,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.110
but he's very

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.180
dear to me.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.054
- Oh, how nice!
- The early days are great.

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:32.120
Right, Takamine?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.830
Yes, right.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.254

But to me, his nosy co-worker with a rather high body temp...

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.854
he's super sweet for some reason.

Seriously!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.563
Okay. Then let's do this again sometime.

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:13.426
We're this way so see you.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.448

Wasn't it a girls' night?

Well, you see...

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.987
Plans changed at the last minute so it became a mini reunion.

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:49.120
We both found out there.

- Yes.

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:56.454
I'm sorry, Soma-kun. I was going to text you.

00:03:56.454 --> 00:04:00.120
It's not like you could have done anything.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.942
So the boyfriend you mentioned earlier...

Wait, your hands are like blocks of ice!

You need to wear more layers.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.220
Here. I told you before to keep your neck warm.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.787
Well, then I'm going that way.

00:04:39.787 --> 00:04:41.254
I'll see you at work.

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:43.754
Yes, see you.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.020
Let's go.

As long as Ogata is happy,

I can still back out of it.

00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:06.720
I'll put a lid on my feelings before they grow bigger.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.618
Is he angry?

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:18.552
You said the plans changed last minute,

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:22.660
but it didn't feel good seeing you with another guy.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.353
Of course.

00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:28.586
I'm sorry.

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:32.320
But you told them about me, right?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.120
Takamine-san said you mentioned having a boyfriend.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.286
The topic came up.

00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:50.053
I told them that I'm seeing someone very special.

00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:53.086
Oh, I'm blushing!

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.953
Then Kotori-san,

00:05:55.953 --> 00:06:00.093
now on, let me know if anything comes up,

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.561
whether it's good or bad.

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:07.986
Let's gradually create something like our own little promises.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.815
"Our" promise.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.914
Okay.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.320
I don't want to make you worry, either.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.453
So if something ever bothers you, tell me.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.627
Then if we go to a drinking party with the opposite sex,

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:36.420
let's tell each other beforehand.

00:06:37.153 --> 00:06:39.986
It's okay if it's for work though.

00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:42.853
Sounds good.

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:44.753
Do you want any terms?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.320
Let's see...

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.686
At work, I'd prefer we maintain a senpai–kohai relationship.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.653
I'm sorry.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.742
I'll be careful from now on.

00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:05.386
Thanks.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:09.853
I wasn't really sure how this dating thing worked, but...

00:07:09.853 --> 00:07:12.886
Can we go on a shopping date next?

00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:15.420
Oh yes, you mentioned that before.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.420
I realize now. We will figure it out together.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.352
I liked that washing machine.

00:07:24.352 --> 00:07:25.619
Me, too.

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:27.219
- Right?
- Yes.

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.252
Weren't you going to get a heater? They had some good ones.

00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:35.219
I'll get one online.

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:37.052
Was it cheaper?

00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:39.586
About the same.

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:42.486
Then buy it now to use it right away.

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:48.386
But I'd have to carry it so I couldn't hold your hand.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.519
I also liked the robot cleaners.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.786
What do you want?

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:56.786
Let me see... a croissant.

00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:59.886
Two croissants and...

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:02.486
- To drink...
- As for drinks...

00:08:02.486 --> 00:08:04.152
An iced coffee for me.

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:07.119
One iced and one hot coffee, both tall.

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.152
Okay.

00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:10.786
That'll be 2,300 yen (15.50 USD).

00:08:10.786 --> 00:08:12.250
I got it. I'll pay.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.850
No, let me.

00:08:13.852 --> 00:08:16.786
Next time. Tap to pay?

00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:18.586
- The crois... Hey!
- Look, look.

00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:22.252
The croissant is bigger than your face!

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:25.652
- Incredible! Let's dig in.
- Yes.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.186
Tasty.

00:08:31.186 --> 00:08:33.019
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Yes.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.770
I've never dated before.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.960
I'd appreciate it if we could take it slow.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.786
How slow is slow?

00:08:48.786 --> 00:08:54.030
Her feelings are important to me, but...

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:59.896
She's just too cute; I don't know if I can take it slow.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.266
Would you like to come in?

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.866
Yes!

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.780
Have that ginger tea while the room warms up.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.552
Thank you.

00:09:16.552 --> 00:09:22.052
And use these to keep you warm.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.952
Your legs might get cold. Sorry for walking in front of you.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.786
Kotori-san.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.786
This will warm me up best.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.786
R-Really?

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.752
I had a lot of fun on today’s date.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.352
Me, too.

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:04.952
Well...

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.110
Are you not going to kiss me today?

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:19.086
I mean, I don't think I can stop if I start.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:22.619
I don't want to do anything you don't want.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.019
I want you to...

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.786
Kotori-san...

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.919
Hey, Nee-chan, let me stay the ni...

Who the heck is this guy?

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:57.686
Wh-What are you doing here?

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.740
I went to visit a friend, but his girlfriend was there.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.686
This is from Mom.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.419
Who are you?

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.952
Hey, don't be rude!

00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:20.152
This is Soma-kun. He's a kohai at work and my...

00:11:20.152 --> 00:11:22.652
boyfriend.

00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:26.819
Soma-kun, this is my little brother, Kairi.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:32.019
Hello, I'm Soma, her boyfriend.

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:36.186
"B-Boyfriend"?

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:43.219
Impression: cold and unfriendly.

00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:45.119
I don't like it!

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:49.919
Face: nice, very "now."

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:51.819
I don't like it!

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:56.786
Body shape: tall and killer body.

00:11:56.786 --> 00:11:58.786
I don't like it!

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:00.950
Conclusion...

00:12:02.752 --> 00:12:05.870
I don't like him, at all!

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:09.252
You're toying with Neechan (older sister), aren't you?

00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:12.419
What are you saying? Soma-kun would never do that!

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:14.119
I'm not toying with her.

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:18.286
I love everything about her. This is serious.

00:12:18.286 --> 00:12:22.730
Then say you didn't touch her,

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.450
although you're in her room so late!

00:12:29.552 --> 00:12:32.886
How dare you do this to my nee-chan, you scoundrel!

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.486
You must have been flirting with her!

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:38.943
Stop it, Kairi. You've got it all wrong.

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:44.519
Fine, I'll play your game.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:48.152
I've got old photos of her!

00:12:48.152 --> 00:12:50.261
I've got lots of them.

00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:53.352
- Jealous?
- Can I see those?

00:12:53.352 --> 00:12:56.252
- Hey, stop it...
- Kairi-san, wait!

00:12:56.252 --> 00:12:59.052
I'm not showing you anything!

00:12:59.052 --> 00:13:02.552
- How mortifying...
- Fine.

00:13:02.552 --> 00:13:09.352
I've got a very recent photo of Kotori-san blissfully eating dorayaki.

00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:12.286
"A very recent photo"?

00:13:12.286 --> 00:13:15.170
When did you take that?

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.619
Would you like to see?

00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.837
Kill me now...

00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:28.186
Sure!

00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:29.652
Hey...

00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:30.886
Look here.

00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:34.877
When she eats, her face hasn't changed since back then.

00:13:34.877 --> 00:13:36.505
She looks so contented.

00:13:36.505 --> 00:13:38.952
I love how she looks when she eats.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.650
Right? That's my nee-chan for you.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.519
Both of you, that's enough!

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.586
Yes, that's enough! Go on and leave!

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:49.886
Kairi!

00:13:49.886 --> 00:13:56.386
No, I'm staying until you know I'm serious about her.

00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:00.919
Are you staying?

00:14:02.552 --> 00:14:04.652
So cute...

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:13.430
I can't believe I'm letting both Kairi and Soma-kun sleep over.

00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:17.752
I'm sorry for ending up staying over.

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:23.019
It's okay. I'm sorry that Kairi is being so rude.

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.952
You can use that to sleep.

00:14:24.952 --> 00:14:27.052
Thank you.

00:14:31.278 --> 00:14:33.786
It's great you two get along.

00:14:33.786 --> 00:14:38.319
Is it getting along, or is he just clingy?

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:41.352
Do you have any siblings?

00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:46.319
I have one older brother.

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:50.419
Really? What is he like?

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:53.286
He's quite normal.

00:14:53.286 --> 00:14:58.152
He doesn't seem to want to talk about him.

00:14:58.152 --> 00:15:04.886
I see. Normal is best though, unlike my brother.

00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:08.152
I'm a bit jealous, to be honest.

00:15:08.152 --> 00:15:13.119
My brother is more like a stranger to me.

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:16.052
"Like a stranger"?

00:15:16.786 --> 00:15:20.852
There must be a story.

00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:44.219
Hey! Don't make out while I'm in the shower!

00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:48.110
You're not a child anymore! Dry yourself off already!

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.350
You’re dripping everywhere!

00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:52.852
Hey, you!

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.952
I'm sleeping next to Nee-chan tonight!

00:15:55.952 --> 00:15:58.952
I'll be on guard all night.

00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:02.552
It's too cold for this; go back now.

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:06.219
Quickly! You're all wet.

00:16:06.219 --> 00:16:08.586
Hot...

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:25.919
Is Soma-kun fine? Is he getting any sleep?

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:34.686
- Soma-kun?
- Quiet.

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:46.652
Give me your hand.

00:16:48.619 --> 00:16:50.286
Okay.

00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:57.952
- You're warm.
- You're cool.

00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:06.319
I'll settle for just this today.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.319
Good night.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:14.252
Good night.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:31.819
How can I sleep with Soma-kun sleeping so close to me?

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:36.852
Chill... Easy now...

00:17:38.286 --> 00:17:39.852
Hold your fire...

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:48.019
I couldn't sleep.

00:17:49.786 --> 00:17:52.219
At all.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.419
Get your energy up, you two!

00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:00.919
Here, I made breakfast. Eat this and wake up.

00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:03.286
I haven't had your cooking in ages!

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:04.986
- Here you go.
- Wow, it looks good.

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:08.300
It doesn't just look good; it is good.

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:11.886
Sorry, Nee-chan. Thanks. Let Soma do it.

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:13.519
- Sure.
- Looks great.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:14.852
Eat up, Onee-chan.

00:18:14.852 --> 00:18:16.386
Sure. Thanks.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:19.152
- Thank you, Kairi-san.
- Go ahead.

00:18:20.686 --> 00:18:21.919
How is it?

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.519
Haven't tried it yet!

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.119
Eat up already.

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:27.452
It's really good!

00:18:27.452 --> 00:18:29.386
Of course, it is!

00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:35.997
Kairi is studying super hard at culinary school to become a chef.

00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:37.486
That's amazing.

00:18:37.486 --> 00:18:40.952
I'm not a great cook so I really admire you.

00:18:43.286 --> 00:18:49.219
At least learn to make porridge for when Nee-chan is ill.

00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:53.086
Got it, I'll practice.

00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:57.019
It feels a bit tingly to have my family and boyfriend here.

00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:58.319
- Eat up.
- Sure.

00:18:58.319 --> 00:19:04.986
But that means Soma-kun is slowly becoming a part of my life...

00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:07.419
and that makes me so happy.

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:10.019
Is something wrong?

00:19:10.019 --> 00:19:12.519
No, nothing.

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:15.552
Do you like it?

00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:18.652
- Very fluffy.
- It is, right?

00:19:21.586 --> 00:19:23.586
I haven't accepted you yet!

00:19:23.586 --> 00:19:26.650
Hurt her and I'll come after you!

00:19:27.286 --> 00:19:29.552
Don't worry.

00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:33.619
I'll stand by her.

00:19:34.252 --> 00:19:36.252
Hey, hands off!

00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:40.786
Kairi, go on, you'll be late for your part-time job!

00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:44.119
Darn it, I'll come check on you again.

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:46.719
- Bye bye, Nee-chan.
- Take care.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.486
Bye bye.

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:53.852
Honestly...

00:19:53.852 --> 00:19:55.952
He's a tornado, here and gone.

00:19:55.952 --> 00:19:58.819
He was such a pain. I'm so sorry.

00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:03.852
No, it was nice to see what real siblings are like.

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:09.386
Let's do a proper sleepover again soon, though.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.686
Shall we?

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.486
What's wrong?

00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:25.819
We've got that long weekend next month.

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:27.086
Right.

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:29.252
Why the sigh? It's good, though.

00:20:29.252 --> 00:20:33.052
That just pushes up the deadlines.

00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:36.786
I can't get motivated until it's almost due.

00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:39.352
I suppose.

00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:41.686
I'll bet you have plans for fun already.

00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:43.752
Of course.

00:20:43.752 --> 00:20:46.752
But you know...

00:20:46.752 --> 00:20:50.886
Long weekend with my dear Kotori-san.

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:55.219
Search "recommended vacation spot for couples."

00:20:59.252 --> 00:21:01.452
Sorry I'm late, Soma-kun.

00:21:01.452 --> 00:21:05.619
No, you weren't late. Want to go get dinner?

00:21:06.219 --> 00:21:09.252
Before we do...

00:21:09.252 --> 00:21:12.870
The limited sweets go on sale today.

00:21:13.486 --> 00:21:16.086
So can we stop by Aiya?

00:21:18.252 --> 00:21:21.023
Sure, of course.

00:21:21.023 --> 00:21:22.686
Thanks.

00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:30.986
I'll wait over here.

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:32.652
Oh, okay.

00:21:32.652 --> 00:21:34.819
I'll be right back.

00:21:39.001 --> 00:21:40.990
I saw you the other day.

00:21:41.952 --> 00:21:44.686
Oh, you're one of our valued customers.

00:21:44.686 --> 00:21:47.228
Thank you for your patronage.

00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:49.252
Not at all.

00:21:50.481 --> 00:21:55.581
Look, it's someone unexpected.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:01.086
Why are you here?

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.686
Is that all you say after so long?

00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:08.052
You never change, do you?

00:22:08.052 --> 00:22:10.919
You know him, Soma-kun?

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:15.286
Sorry for not introducing myself earlier.

00:22:15.286 --> 00:22:18.486
Thanks for caring for my otouto (younger brother).

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:24.623
"Ayato Soma"?

00:22:24.623 --> 00:22:26.530
S-Soma?

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:31.852
What? Is he Soma-kun's older brother?

00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:36.886
Pleasure to meet you.

00:22:36.886 --> 00:22:41.352
I'm Kotori Ogata, one of Soma's co-workers.

00:22:41.352 --> 00:22:44.519
"Co-worker"?

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:46.619
Is that so?

00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:52.552
I never thought I'd see you here.

00:22:52.552 --> 00:22:55.450
It's been six years.

00:22:56.052 --> 00:22:58.719
Glad to see you are well.

00:23:00.352 --> 00:23:05.080
So when are you returning to Kyoto?

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:09.486
I thought I made it clear; I'll never return there.

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.152
Let's go, Kotori-san.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:24.219
Soma-kun?

00:24:32.219 --> 00:24:33.386
I actually don't want you to do it!

00:24:33.386 --> 00:24:35.786
- He requested Ogata.
- I'd like to decline.

00:24:35.786 --> 00:24:38.193
Won't you regret turning it down?

00:24:38.193 --> 00:24:43.050
I knew I'd regret it if I didn't accept the job.
