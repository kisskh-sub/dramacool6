It's no use.

- Of course, it won't work. - No way.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.069
Not even the Bionic Woman could pull that off.

I'm so dead if I'm late again today.

There's no more room. Stop letting people on and just go!

Hey. Can you hold your breath in?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.330
What?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.730
Okay, take a deep breath.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.370
- One, two. - I told you there is no room!

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.680
- Come on. - That's enough, please!

And that's how our story begins.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.480
We were young, but our lives were exhausting and threadbare.

Gosh. That was a close call.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.230
I mean, how does a bus conductor miss her own bus?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.139
If it weren't for that young lady,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.810

It was expensive, you know?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.280
Then pay me back later, with interest.

Oh, right.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.479
That gooey, love-struck look.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.879
Is that any way to talk to your husband?

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.850
Goodness gracious.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.090
Water.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.490
All right, fine.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.930
He used to be such a romantic.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.859
Where did that Han Gi Bok go?

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.570
And who's this gray-haired man standing over there?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.900
I miss that guy.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.040
Ice.

00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:25.710
Seriously. Could you not have asked at once?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.500
I'm home.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.470
- Jae Pil! - You're back.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.770
Wait. Stop!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.589
For a kid who was supposedly studying,

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.120
Your hair's soaking wet.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.729
I ran home for some exercise.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.830
Why would you run? You're a high school senior.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.329
You should be studying every waking moment.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.899
Especially since you already took a whole year off.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.500
You're already so far behind.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.610
It's not like you're dense or something.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.209
You have an IQ of 140.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.610
Why can't you bring your grades up?

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.980
And what's this?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.320
Are you going to start inspecting my underwear too now?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.900
Go upstairs and wash up.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.449
Should I take a shower too?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.810
After we put Se Ri to bed early?

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.330
Jae Pil!

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.830
You startled me.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.800
Se Ri.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.970
My little Magic Princess.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.899
I'm not the Magic Princess.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.040
The Magic Princess is Minky.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.240
In my day, it was Se Ri.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.340
What is it?

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.049
Do you want me to cut out more paper dolls?

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.849
Yes. Mom says she can't look away in case a kissing scene is on.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.220
What does a kid like you know about kissing?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.389
Come here. There.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.460
Here we go.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.999
All right. I'll do my best not to cut the tail off...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.699
like I did last time.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.370
- Okay. - Okay.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.150
I got you.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.160
Go toward the light. May you be reborn a human next time.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.359
Gosh. That scared the daylights out of me.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.390
Oh, my.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.640
Goodness. She is not ordinary, that one.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.939
Here. Have some water with that.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.569
You'll get sores in your mouth if you keep eating like that.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.270
Is that your fourth one already?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.419
Anyway, our Ms. Koh here. She's a real piece of work?

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.489
A bus conductor who's constantly motion sick.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.719
Always motion sick, but with a monster appetite.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.929
She eats like a pig, but is still skinny as a rail.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.229
And with that slender body, she smacks cockroaches dead easily.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.200
I couldn't even eat lunch because of my motion sickness.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.970
So I have to eat whenever I can.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.339
Yeong Rye. You should try wearing sunglasses.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.780
Hong Ja from next door says it helps a bit with the carsickness.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.310
But she gets motion sickness when it rains, too.

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.680
I thought I took my glasses off...

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.650
What is wrong with me?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.860
Hey. Is it that hilarious?

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.269
You really have a strange sense of humor.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.330
This one's not ordinary, either.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.699
Hey. You brats!

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.870
Will you shut your mouths?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.769
Today, I'm feeling...

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.379
really down and sensitive, okay?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.610
She's on a diet right now, so she's feeling a little sensitive.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.979
I was just trying to get some sleep.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.219
And suddenly, I smell sweet bread from you stuffing your face.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.449
And the other is chattering away.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.289
Can't you all just be quiet...

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.690
and act a little more sophmored?

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.890
Hae Ja.

00:18:08.891 --> 00:18:11.030
I think you mean "sophisticated," not "sophmored."

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.570
The Three Corns.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.170
Front and center.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.010
Front and center!

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.649
It's showtime. Song and dance.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.450
And you're not done until I'm in a good mood.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.990
If I don't like it, we're skipping to the next track.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.820
"Singing and Dancing." Start.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.390
Don't you know what start means? It means you can begin.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.329
- All our beloved friends - All our beloved friends

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.869
- Let us all gather around - Let us all gather around

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.540
All right, stop!

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.940
"Friends Forever."

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.549
- Like the wings of a dove - Like the wings of a dove

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.819
- That circle the blue sky - That circle the blue sky

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.289
Corns, I can't hear you. Raise your volume!

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.989
- Our hearts take to flight - Our hearts take to flight

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.290
- And soar right through the sky - And soar right through the sky

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.900
- We all share a laugh and a smile - We all share a laugh and a smile

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.430
- Living for the dream - Living for the dream

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.340
- Of a brand new tomorrow - Of a brand new tomorrow

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.070
- Oh, friends forever - Oh, friends forever

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.780
- Oh, hearts full of bliss - Oh, hearts full of bliss

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.110
- Oh, what a... - Oh, what a joyful life

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.550
Yes.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.260
Come in.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.330
All right. Listen up.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.229
This is the new hire who just came in today.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.330
Seo Jong Hee.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.970
She says it's her first time as a conductor,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.010
so teach her well.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.940
Try not to learn any bad habits.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.050
Now, get to sleep!

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.390
What's your name again?

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.690
Seo Jong Hee.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.460
Well, aren't we informal?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.799
You look a good 4 or 5 years younger than me.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.999
How old are you?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.369
I'm 23.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.570
What are you going to do about it?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.210
We're the same, then.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.110
- The same? - Yes.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.110
What does age matter? Time served is what counts.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.380
A new hire, smacking her gum right in a senior's face.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.720
The nerve on this one.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.660
Quite the spectacle for her first day.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.360
You mean a debacle, not a spectacle.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.960
Spectacle is for when the view is spectacular.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.229
Hey. Are you crazy?

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.900
Who does a new hire think she is, talking to my...

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.500
What was after Seo?

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.610
- Jong Hee. - Fine.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.379
Jong Hee. Ding Dong. Whatever.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.410
You're really smart, aren't you?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.979
So smart...

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.649
you've got more guts than brains.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.720
Right?

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.660
You.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.920
Do you have any idea who I am in this room?

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.400
(Room 3)

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.150
"By the time."

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.880
"By the time."

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.650
"Keep it."

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.510
"English Grammar..."

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.690
(English Grammar)

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.620
That's a good one.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.860
But you really should sleep when everyone else is.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.660
Excuse me.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:20.339
Are you really the same age as Hae Ja?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.910
What? Of course not. That was a lie.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.540
So what are you? Year of Tiger?

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.379
Or are you Year of Rabbit?

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.580
I'm...

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.950
Year of Rabbit.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.020
Stop staring.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.560
So, we really are the same age.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.130
Gosh. That was quite the performance earlier.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.650
(Cheongah Bus)

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.910
Gosh. Is it morning already?

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.890
You should get up.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:49.890
Wake up.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.210
(Cheongah Bus)

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.840
Start.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.310
One, two, three, four,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.350
five, six, seven, eight.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.290
Two, two, three, four,

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.560
five, six, seven, eight.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.520
One, two, three, four,

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.390
five, six, seven, eight.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.499
Two, two, three, four,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.299
five, six, seven. One more time.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.000
One, two, three, four,

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.799
- Five, six... - That wench...

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.270
is not your average girl, is she?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.810
Yes, she looks like she's been around.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.340
She's no ordinary girl, that one.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.750
And I bet that wench lied about her age, too.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.620
I'll have to put her in her place right from the start.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.620
Darn it.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.460
Good morning, sir.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.760
- Jae Pil. Do you want a ride? - Hello.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.259
Just pretend you didn't see me, sir.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.260
I'm off.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.039
(Cheongah Bus)

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.509
Bus number three.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.209
Bus three conductor. Where are you? Hurry up and get going.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.640
You're two minutes late already!

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.209
Here you are. Koh Yeong Rye.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.509
Hey. Get over here.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.079
You've got a trainee today.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.080
What?

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.549
Hae Ja would be better...

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.549
Enough. She's the most honest person at this company,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.920
and our best worker.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.990
I'm counting on you. I'll leave you two.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.900
Please show me the ropes.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.770
"The most honest and best worker here."

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.540
Please. "The best?" Hardly.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.440
As if I have anything to teach.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.040
(Maintain street order.)

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.580
Watch your step on the way out.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.249
No matter how many passengers are getting off,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.559
you must collect the fare from all as they exit.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.629
Because in a crowd, you lose track of who's paid and who hasn't.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.029
And for passengers paying with cash, the trick is making change.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.859
You have to be fast and accurate, no matter what.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.729
With practice, you can just stick your hand in your pocket,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.970
and you'll be able to feel if it's a cent or a dime.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.470
You've got some skills.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.140
You should use that talent for good. Now, how about a real ticket?

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.910
Darn it.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.219
Gosh. It looked so real. How did you know right away?

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.449
The paper feels different, but the giveaway is their eyes.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.259
People using fakes always have shifty eyes.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.390
Impressive.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.630
Please board!

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.330
Let's go.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.270
Driver. All clear!

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.950
One at a time, please. Watch your step.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.660
- Pay in the back! - In the back.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.530
Hold on.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.429
Why just one fare? You must pay for your friends too.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.430
My friends?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.000
What are you talking about? I got on alone.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.010
Yeong Rye.

00:28:59.011 --> 00:29:01.010
- Yeong Rye. Where are you going? - What's happening?

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.510
Goodness. There she goes again.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.010
Unbelievable.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.100
Three tokens.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.870
Pay up. Now.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.040
If I were going to pay, do you think I would've run?

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.910
My mom always said...

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.410
"Even a flea has its pride."

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.920
"You can live with nothing, but you can't live with no shame."

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.249
Wait!

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.260
Wait.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.830
Can we maybe go the other way?

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.729
I get really bad motion sickness.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.830
What are you talking about?

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.699
No way. You're not going anywhere until you pay up.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.270
I said, pay the fare!

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.710
Three tokens. Now.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.369
Get out of my way. Okay?

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.680
Get out of the way!

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.589
This is your last warning.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.590
Move.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.559
One, two,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560
three!

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.010
You should've just paid up.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.609
This is going to cost you more in doctor's bills.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:39.710
What are you...

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.150
Wait!

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080
Where is it?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300
Thank...

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.580
Are you okay?

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.120
Yes.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.700
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.840
Hey! Assume the position!

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.539
Hey! You want to go?

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540
Get down!

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.350
I told you all to be on time!

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.150
Next.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.320
Who's this? You're late again? That's two extra for you.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.530
Goodness. I nearly jumped out of my skin.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.260
I thought the dean was here.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.170
Well, the PTA president's son sneaking in.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.910
Hey.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.740
I hear they call you "Prince Charming."

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.080
- Must be nice? - Hey.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.080
"Prince Charming," is it?

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.979
He was held back a year because he was sick.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.720
So you should be calling him "Your Highness," you punk.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.420
Your Highness.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.689
What's it going to be?

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.990
Care for a smoke, Your Highness?

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.420
Knock yourself out.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.170
Quiet!

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.500
Sit down.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.240
All right. There are no special announcements.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.910
Who's the empty seat?

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.310
Han Jae Pil, sir. He had to use the bathroom.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.820
Oh, Jae Pil.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.489
And air this place out during your break.

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:12.419
The female teachers are coming to me in tears.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.319
They say the smell is so bad they can't teach. Okay?

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.860
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.290
That's all.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.809
What is it? Did you oversleep, Jinxed Jae Pil?

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.309
Get off. It's too hot for all that.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.180
I don't want to. I'm going to stick to you like glue.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.850
I think I'm seriously touch-starved.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.379
My parents were so busy with work that they didn't hold me much...

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.380
as a baby.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:43.450
Let's see.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.720
Gosh. Spicy stir-fried octopus!

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.359
Doesn't your stepmom realize that you can't handle spicy food at all?

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.659
"Can't handle it?" What are you talking about?

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.199
I can handle my spice just fine now, okay?

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.859
Please. You rinse your kimchi. Who are you kidding?

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.330
That was in middle school. Give me that.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.109
You're so cute.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.810
It's cute. You and your pride.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.380
You're coming to the match tomorrow, right?

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220
Of course, I am.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.520
Seventh period is gym, so let's go out then.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.470
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.649
Yeong Rye.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.619
Why are you ironing the towels we use to clean our hands and feet?

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.179
All that fuss over nothing.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.090
I was just bored.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.090
Just leave that be.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.389
Why don't you try and mend the ripped ones instead?

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:55.660
I just can't seem to get it right.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.200
But you're a certified seamstress, aren't you?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.829
Gosh.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.160
Goodness.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.430
You just can't sit still, can you? It's like a sickness.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.239
You're not going to work in a factory,

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.470
so why bother with the certificate?

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.140
You never know.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.180
You're a professional.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.610
Hey. Popcorn Rookie.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.480
Get over here and rub my back.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.600
Hey. Do it right, will you?

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.900
Level two.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.640
Okay. Level three.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.410
It's so cold.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.420
Girls. Aren't you getting hungry?

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.420
Snacks are on me.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.020
Hey. Newcomer.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.330
Newcomer.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.060
- Me? - Yes, you.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.070
The new hires are always on snack duty.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.169
I'm only saying this once, so listen up.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.569
Go to Ddoddo Snack Bar at the intersection,

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.139
Get 10 jumbo dumplings, 2 bags of tteokbokki without green onions,

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.140
Three servings of sundae without the lung,

00:37:17.141 --> 00:37:18.439
but with the heart and liver.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.239
And five fish cake rods, not the folded ones,

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.279
with lots of broth.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.749
Then, at Hwajung Supermarket next door,

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.609
get 5 packs of crackers and 4 rainbow candies,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.149
4 almond chocolate bars, and 2 1-liter cartons of milk.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.150
Did you get that?

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.050
Go on. Hurry up.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.300
Can you repeat that?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160
What was that?

00:37:42.161 --> 00:37:44.030
I'm pretty sure I said I was only saying it once.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.840
If you're too late, we'll get indigestion.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.610
Be back by 10pm. Any later and you're locked out.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.380
Aren't you going?

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.080
You only have 29 minutes left.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.459
Ten jumbo dumplings. Two bags of tteokbokki, no green onions,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.929
And for the sundae...

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.399
Did she say no heart? Just a moment.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.769
No lung and add liver and heart. Three servings.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.409
And five fish cake rods, not the folded ones,

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.839
And extra broth, please.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840
Hey.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.279
Can you please ring this up first? Quickly.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.380
Just a minute. I need to finish this other bill first.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.450
Twenty jumbo dumplings, 35 cents.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.260
Three plates of tteokbokki...

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.190
are 27 cents.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.300
Sundae is 15 cents.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.529
The fish cakes...

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.630
are 24 cents.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.540
The fritters are 22 cents.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.810
And then the kimbap. One, two, three rolls...

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.779
I need to start over from the beginning.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.320
No, it's okay. Give it here. I'll do it.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.649
That's 35 plus 27 plus 15...

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.459
plus 24, plus 22, and 30.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.230
So that's a total of 1.53 dollars.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.129
Oh, my. You're incredibly fast.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.200
They sure ate a lot.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.700
You've got a lot of tricks up your sleeve?

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.840
And when did you learn to use an abacus?

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.740
Well, I figured you never know, so I got my abacus certification.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.880
But listen, you need to be careful.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.350
If you get on Hae Ja's bad side, life in this dorm will be tough.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.620
In our room, what she says goes.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120
Why?

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.050
Well, for one, she's the oldest.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.820
And she has been here the longest.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.860
- And her personality... - Is a total wench, right?

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960
That's what it seems like.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.760
I don't like her either.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.630
- Oh, right. Hey. - Yes?

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.740
Do you think you can carry all this back?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.939
Sure. Where are you off to?

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.940
Well...

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.840
Since I'm already out, I figured I'd go see my mom.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.909
You need to get back fast, okay? All right?

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.350
Hurry. Go on. Okay?

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.850
Hurry up!

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.660
Mom.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.060
- Mom. - What?

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.370
Hey. Why are you running?

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.500
You said running made your head spin and that you'll throw up.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300
What are you doing here?

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.740
I was in the neighborhood and figured you might still be here.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.809
Are you about to pack up?

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.810
Yes.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.550
Goodness gracious.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.720
I even had a customer for the horse ride today.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.690
"This horse is so old. The spring isn't sturdy enough."

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.020
Unbelievably picky. They were a real pain.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.159
At least a few people showed up later in the evening.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.760
And I sold about a dozen lucky draws.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.930
Anyway...

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.000
The best sight is a customer's back as they're leaving.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.429
All right. You two, hop down.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.640
- Okay. - Come over here.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.000
- Come on. - Come on, Yeong Mi.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.770
Let's go.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.540
Good job, my little helpers.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.450
Here.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.650
Here, you have one too.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.790
Get a sugar boost before you head out or whatever.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:27.760
It's sweet.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.230
You've got some sleep in your eye, Yeong Mi.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.440
Looks like nothing's missing.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:52.010
Didn't I ask you to buy those egg cookies?

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.850
No, you didn't.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.890
I'm sure I would've remembered that.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.090
Aren't you guys going to set the table?

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.989
- You want me to set the table too? - Coming, Hae Ja.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.060
Goodness.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.870
What?

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.099
Newcomer. Are you planning on eating?

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.439
Too bad. You've still got work to do.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.470
What else is there to do?

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.680
The blankets get washed every ten days.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.080
And that's the new hire's job.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.610
Right?

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.179
That goes without saying, Hae Ja.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.120
If the new hire doesn't do it, who else will?

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.290
That is really classy.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.859
You're being so petty over food. Seriously.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.860
Hey.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.030
What did you just say?

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:48.740
Nothing.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.870
I said, "Enjoy your meal."

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.289
What are you waiting for? Set the table.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.790
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.200
Is Yeong Sik always this late?

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.560
Of course, he is.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.830
Being poor is a curse.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.670
At his age, he should only be focused on studying,

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.070
But instead, he has to worry about making money.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.140
Whenever I think about your brother,

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.080
it breaks my heart. I feel so sorry for him.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.810
It tears me up inside.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.880
You only ever feel sorry for Yeong Sik.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:38.990
What about my tuition?

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.790
I'll pay it. The deadline isn't here yet.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.660
Mom.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.960
Look.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.200
What if we ask our uncle?

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.070
What uncle? You don't have an uncle.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.770
I wouldn't even walk in their direction.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.970
No matter how desperate you get, don't you go groveling to them.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:00.380
The second your father died, they sold the family burial grounds.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.780
What do you expect from people who'd just cut us off like that?

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.350
Honestly, you'd have an easier time getting blood from a stone.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.289
Yeong Mi. You're slacking, aren't you?

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.890
I can tell you're just resting your hands on it.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.089
Put your back on it. Come on.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.689
It'll be easier on Mom that way.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.830
Come on.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.799
- One, two. - One, two.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.170
- One, two. - Goodness.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.870
We're almost there! One, two!

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.340
Come out!

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.339
Come out of there, now!

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.810
Oh, no!

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.649
Hey! Ok Hui. Are you out of your mind?

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.279
- I can't hold it anymore! - Are you insane?

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.090
I'm about to have an accident, right now!

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.389
I'm sorry, okay?

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.059
I'm really about to have an accident. I'm sorry.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.620
- I'm sorry! - Get out!

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.309
What on earth is going on here?

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.169
Oh, my gosh. This is killing me.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.840
I have no idea.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.480
Since dawn, it's like a thunderstorm was raging inside my stomach.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.619
And then...

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.420
- it hit every single one of us... - I feel like my organs are out.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.560
The other rooms are fine.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.460
Darn it.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.830
What did you eat to all get explosive diarrhea?

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.130
Are you two all right?

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.730
Yes, I'm fine.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.040
- Yes, me too. - Gosh. I'm in pain.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.840
Gosh. This is a disaster. We've got buses scheduled to leave.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.180
How are we supposed to cover all these shifts?

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.880
Oh, my gosh. I'm going to have an accident.

00:45:45.881 --> 00:45:48.349
As you all know, right?

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.349
This is an emergency.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.189
It's an emergency, so it's no time to say, "That's not my job," right?

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.059
So we all need to pitch in and get this done fast.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.689
Look, I'll take it if you insist.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.659
But what are we supposed to do with this?

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.899
Because someone has to be there to collect the fares.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.399
- For now... - For now!

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.639
Just get on the bus. All you do is open and close doors.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.570
Collect the fares and then go.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.509
It's simple, right? Here, take it. Quick.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.179
This is no time to stand around. Hurry up and get ready!

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.979
What are you doing? Get on.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.710
Let's get moving. Go.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.350
Koh Yeong Rye! Aren't you coming?

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.650
Trainee!

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.350
You're riding on a different bus today!

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.050
Hurry!

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.440
You punk.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.540
If it was this bad,

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.440
you should've said something back then!

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.039
What are we supposed to do now?

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040
Goodness.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.150
And you have a match coming up!

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.280
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.920
If we lose the welterweight, we're completely ruined.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.760
I can still fight.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.260
I just need a bit more icing.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.899
Hey. You think icing is going to fix this?

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.769
You're trying to make me out to be the bad guy.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.040
You could end your whole career like this, you punk! You hear me?

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.539
I don't know whether to kill you or not.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.040
I'm seriously losing my mind.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.709
- Coach! - Yes?

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.810
Coach.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.610
We're here.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.420
We seriously ran our way here.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.750
Jae Pil.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.260
Could you do me a favor, just this once?

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.900
Me?

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.639
No way. Why would I do something like that?

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.099
What do you mean, "no way?"

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.170
Then why does everyone have explosive diarrhea?

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.080
Only you and Yeong Rye are fine, and you didn't eat with us.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.110
You put something in the food, didn't you?

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.009
What is it? Did you spike it with laxatives?

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.050
Hey.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.120
I wouldn't stoop to a cheap trick like that.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.950
- I'm not like you. - What did you say?

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.689
You brat. How old are you?

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.419
Spit it out! How old are you, you wench?

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.260
Does your age make you royalty or something?

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.989
Gosh. You're really something else.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.489
- Look at them go. - Hey. Let go of me!

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.900
- Good grief. - Hey!

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.830
At this rate, she'll get her scalp torn right off, don't you think?

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.600
Goodness. What a vicious wench.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.769
She didn't just poke the bear.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.399
She went and pulled Kwon Hae Ja by the hair?

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.409
- What's wrong with you? - Hey.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.539
Who do you think will let go first?

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.339
My money's on Kwon Hae Ja.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.879
- You two. Stop it. - Hey!

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.709
- Hey. Come on, you two. - Stop it, already!

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.910
I'm betting on the new hire.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.280
Yeong Rye, how about you? Who are you betting on?

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.449
- Gosh. I'm out of here. - Stop it.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:39.450
Hey.

00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:41.889
Gosh. I'm also...

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.329
Don't hit the face!

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.959
Hey, let go!

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.299
All right. In 1, 2, 3, you both let go. Do you hear me?

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.469
One, two, three!

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.299
Of course, you wouldn't let go. Just brilliant!

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.239
- Hey. Let go! - You let go!

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.340
- One, two, three! - One, two...

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.810
Honestly, these troublemakers.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.149
Kwon Hae Ja. Are you sure about this?

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.350
I'm telling you, I'm positive!

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.250
I'm telling you, she's the one who did it!

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.519
If she isn't the one, I'll change my last name.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.890
From Kwon to Con.

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:18.190
In fact, I'll just quit my job here altogether.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.330
Listen. He's the favorite to win, so...

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.229
Focus on your defense. Stay defensive, and then...

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.270
Don't get too aggressive. Don't force it.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.800
Stick to defense, and take any opening you see. Okay?

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:44.650
Box!

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:20.850
That's right!

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.889
- Land a punch! Smash his head in! - Hey!

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.860
- Go for his head! - No, don't!

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.470
Jae Pil. Are you okay?

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.810
No, just leave me alone!

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.350
I said no!

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.320
Please, stop!

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.720
My mom says she doesn't want you to!

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.830
No!

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.800
One!

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.700
Two!

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:12.500
Three!

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:14.340
Four!

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.640
Five!

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:19.670
Are you okay?

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.349
- Nice. - That's it.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.750
- This is your moment! - Box!

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.610
One, two, three,

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.750
four, five,

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.489
- six, seven... - Come on. Hang in there!

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.390
- Eight, nine! - Eight, nine!

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:07.120
Ten!

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.460
You did it!

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.749
The new Aurora TV by Shinheung Electronics...

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.779
you've seen advertised everywhere.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.589
It's 20 inches.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:37.819
And in keeping with the new age of color,

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.019
this model even comes equipped with color controls.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.460
- Nice, isn't it? - Thank you.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.590
The color looks great, too.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.990
- Try another channel. - Sure, sir.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800
(Royal Color TV)

00:53:48.801 --> 00:53:52.870
There was a major upset today at the youth boxing championship.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.399
That kid there looks a lot like my boy.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.769
An unknown rookie defeated...

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.910
It's not just a resemblance. I think that actually is Jae Pil.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.010
- What? - As the winner was announced,

00:54:00.011 --> 00:54:03.810
the gym was filled with an uproar of both cheers and shock.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:06.819
With this win, this unknown rookie...

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.049
could be on his way to stardom. All eyes are on what's next.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.289
- That punk. - Experts are saying...

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.750
he is showing great potential.

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.900
Yeong Rye. Are you going to wash up?

00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:59.930
Over here.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.870
Why? What's going on?

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:07.210
Well...

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.140
Just a minute ago...

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:13.880
Did a cat get your tongue?

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.119
What on earth were you doing, throwing punches, you punk!

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.720
I wasn't throwing punches. It's called boxing.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.020
What?

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.320
The nerve of you...

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.459
This is what happens when you run around doing this.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.099
And why your grades are awful despite being so smart, you punk!

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.299
You don't want to go to college?

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.130
You're already a year behind. You want to retake exams for years?

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.699
Do you think I'm working so hard as PTA president...

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.400
and pouring money down the drain so you can mess around like this?

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:39.170
Stop this nonsense and get a tutor.

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:41.839
I'll get you the best one money can buy.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.409
No. Besides, that's illegal.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.510
Why you little...

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.220
Since when have you ever cared about the law, you punk?

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.520
You're doing it!

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.889
You have to get into college, don't you?

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.120
I won't.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:55.259
College isn't my dream.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.729
It's your regret you couldn't go. It's your dream, not mine.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:58.730
What did you say?

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.000
You disrespectful little punk.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.370
What are you going to do? Stare me down, you punk?

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:09.940
Get on the floor.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.440
I said, get on the floor, you little punk!

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.490
You dare treat your own father like he's trash?

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.590
What was that?

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.430
College is my regret?

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:32.429
If you know that,

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.960
then you should grit your teeth and work even harder!

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.340
Are you still refusing the tutor?

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:42.670
How about now?

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.040
And now!

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:52.740
It hurts.

What are you guys doing in here?

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.700
Hey!

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.230
Why are you in my bag at this hour?

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:55.740
What's all this noise?

00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:59.239
Why are you making such a racket? I can't even sleep.

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.240
Well, they were sneaking around, going through my bag like alleycats!

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:07.950
What's this all about?

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.920
Are you stealing things now, too?

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:14.159
This.

(Dowon Pharmacy)

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:16.660
What is it?

00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:18.690
It's medicine from Suk Ja's bag.

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.060
I'm pretty sure it's a laxative.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.670
Earlier, in the washroom,

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:26.670
I even saw her eating a cream bun.

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:29.939
Who eats a cream bun when they have an upset stomach?

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.170
I didn't eat any cream bun!

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:34.340
Hae Ja, it wasn't me.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.210
She's just jumping to conclusions.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.810
Then what is this?

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:40.480
It's...

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:42.350
It's cold medicine.

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.050
Ever since yesterday,

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.760
I've been feeling a cold coming on.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.530
Then let me try one.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.399
We'll know if it's cold medicine or a laxative, right?

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.760
Since I don't have an upset stomach.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.630
What? Nothing yet?

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.500
Wait. Is this actually cold medicine?

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:57.690
(Bathroom)

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:06.000
Thank goodness.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:08.100
That it finally kicked in.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:12.110
That's right.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.210
I did it!

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.910
I'm always stuck on standby, not making a dime.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.520
I was sick of watching you all be so happy-go-lucky.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.420
I wanted you to know what it's like to miss work and lose out on pay.

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:30.790
So I put some laxatives in the fish cake broth.

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:32.260
- So what? - Hey.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.730
Do you hear yourself right now?

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:35.759
This girl's completely lost it!

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.469
That's right! I have lost it!

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.470
Do you think I'd do that if I were in my right mind?

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.300
Let's be honest here.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.440
Is there a single one of you who hasn't skimmed off the top?

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.040
So why should I be the only one who gets punished?

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.510
Why is it just me?

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.800
You were so sure of yourself.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.470
And I wasn't the culprit, was I?

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.710
So?

01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:24.980
You told the personnel manager and the housemother, didn't you?

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.820
That if I weren't the one to blame,

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180
you'd quit...

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:34.619
this place entirely.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.620
So what?

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.860
You really expect me to resign over something this petty?

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:40.460
How dare you threaten me!

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.740
If there's one thing I hate, it's violence.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.940
Let's just keep this between us.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.110
All the dirty looks I'll get at work thinking I'm the culprit...

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.980
I can handle it.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.980
But...

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.020
Stop making the other girls give you massages.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.290

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.750
I'm not okay. This is my...

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.490
fifth trip already.

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.490
Hey. Do you want to go to the hospital?

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:41.820
- Or maybe... - That's not it.

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:44.330
I'm just starving.

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.060
From flushing everything out.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.320
Are you sure you should be eating that?

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.990
That ramyeon's going to be rough on your stomach.

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:12.090
I don't care.

01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:14.020
I'm just going to eat while I can.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:15.590
Even if it goes right through me.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.059
You're a closet oddball, aren't you?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.299
A closet oddball? What's that?

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.399
Someone who's secretly an oddball.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.800
They're scarier than the obvious ones.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.470
Well, now you know.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:26.830
And you're definitely one.

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:33.740
- This is good. - It is?

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.380
Watch this. I'll show you something cool.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.050
I can even do this with my neck.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.650
Here I go.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:44.820
Watch.

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:49.290
Pretty cool, right?

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.060
Do you want to try?

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.460
Yes.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.370
Don't tell me you're a certified hula hoop instructor, too.

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:08.780
You're always so driven.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.750
You have a ton of certificates and always study in your spare time.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.290
Those are just things I got as a backup plan.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.359
But my real dream...

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.159
is to go to college.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.230
After I pass my GED.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.660
"College?"

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960
Gosh. That's impressive.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:32.029
I'll major in Korean Literature.

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.600
And become a teacher or a professor.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.210
It might take a while, but...

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.910
Once things are better for my family,

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.380
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:46.750
What about you?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.550
Do you have a dream?

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.820
Of course, I do.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:53.150
I'm going to...

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:56.620
Maybe I'll become Miss Korea.

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.130
And after that, I'll become an actress.

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:05.770
I'll make people laugh and cry, and move them.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:10.640
A star that shines brighter than all the others up there.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.140
That's so amazing.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.850
You'll definitely make it.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.680
I don't know about that.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.390
The way things are going, I'll be stuck yelling "All clear!"

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:30.420
In this book I'm studying,

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:32.860
there's this one quote.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.560
"Boys, be ambitious."

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.070
What does that mean?

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:44.170
"Boys, be ambitious."

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.840
"Not for money or for your own selfish success."

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.450
"And not for that fleeting thing that people call fame."

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:57.950
"But for the sake of attaining all that a person is meant to be."

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.720
So every morning, I recite a little mantra.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.600
"Girls, be ambitious."

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.930
Who says only boys get to be ambitious?

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.640
Girls should be, too.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.440
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.410
I think I just fell for you.

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.250
Well...

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.380
I already have.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:35.160
The moment you blew that huge bubble on the bus.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360
You did?

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.460
That's a relief. I'm glad it's mutual.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:44.300
Because I'm not a fan of unrequited love.

01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:49.740
Oh, right.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940
By the way...

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.340
You know how we work two days on, then get one day off, right?

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.510
What are you going to do on yours?

01:07:58.610 --> 01:07:59.710
I don't know.

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:05.790
Sleeping all day feels like a waste, though.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.590
- Do you want to go downtown? - Yes!

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.490
- Really? - Yes.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.890
Let's go downtown together!

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.430
- Together? - Yes!

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
That'll be so much fun!

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:18.570
Okay!

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:21.770
Show me that trick again.

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:23.399
- It was pretty neat, right? - Yes.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.340
Okay. Watch.

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:29.039
- One, two, three, four, - Gosh.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.649
- five, six, seven, eight. - Let me try.

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.780
- You want to try? - Yes.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.020
Careful. Come over here.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920
One...

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:42.420
You bend over like this, and...

01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:03.110
Read yours.

Open wide.

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.190
You eat it.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.290
Here it is. I spotted this place the other day.

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.400
They take song requests, and they have live music sometimes.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.200
Welcome to Vivaldi.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.599
- Hi. - Hi.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.830
Please, sit wherever you'd like.

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.640
How about here?

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.150
What was that? High-five me.

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:50.189
- High-five. - Yes!

01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:51.229
I'm off now.

01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:52.690
- Go on, then! - See you later!

01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:58.430
- Did you ask? - Yes.

01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:06.070
They're playing our song!

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.619
So, where should we go today?

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.650
- Today? - Yes.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:21.960
Vivaldi.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.090
Vivaldi. Let's go.

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:27.530
(Vivaldi)

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.070
- Why isn't it working? - Try again.

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.170
I can't.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.140
One more time.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940
Do you want to try together?

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.820
Your dad's really something else.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.479
It's not as if you did anything wrong.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.150
And all just because you like to box.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.250
He goes and gets you a full-time driver? Honestly.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.190
Are you getting whisked away again or are you going straight home?

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860
Probably?

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:03.900
It's no fun at the gym without you. I've got no motivation to work out.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.540
That's separation anxiety you've got there.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.170
You should take this chance to wean yourself off me.

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:14.040
And learn to stand on your own two feet.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.340
No way. I'm not interested.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.849
I still need to go to Ddoddo Snack Bar with you.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:21.220
There's this girl, a regular, that I've got my eye on.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:22.820
Hey.

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:24.619
Instead of just moping,

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.750
do you want to come up with a little plan?

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.490
"A plan?"

01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:32.130
You have to come later, okay?

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:41.239

All right, take one and go.

01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.340
All right. Move along.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.109
Good work.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.709
Grab one and go. Keep it moving.

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:51.950
Hey, stop. Ji Hoon!

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.679
That was some great acting. Well done?

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.820
It was really natural. You can take two.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.350
Well done. Bravo.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.729
Hey. Just to grab some tteokbokki with you...

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.199
I just blew through two weeks' worth of bus tokens.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.399
This was all you. Planning, directing, and acting.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.829
I told you I wasn't that into it, remember?

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:14.170
Come on.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.699
But I'm telling you, that girl at Ddoddo Snack Bar is beautiful.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.440
I just wanted to show you what she looks like...

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.240
- Look at him. He's so handsome. - Oh, my gosh.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.079
Did you see that?

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.410
Did you see how she was looking at her?

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.150
I saw.

01:12:28.151 --> 01:12:31.289
This Prince Charming. What am I supposed to do with you?

01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:35.120
This guy is rich, smart, and popular.

Hey. Don't even be a top student, too.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.160
If you're a good student, you'll be insufferable.

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:40.690
I'm not hanging out with you then.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.330
- Careful coming down. - Okay.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.669
Gosh. It's been forever since we had a day off.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:52.670

You'll see.

01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:20.900
A movie that builds character.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.170

No, it's just...

01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:23.779
What's all this? What do you kids think you're doing?

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.990
Run for it!

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.289
- Stop right there! - Hey! Get back here!

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:29.490
Get back here.

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:31.329
- Hey! - Darn it.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.630
- Hey! - Hey.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:36.930
(Madame Aema)

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.170
So this...

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.940
This is supposed to be so important to us?

01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:45.540
Of course.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.710
It'll do us a world of good.

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:51.850
Look. We're not minors. What's the big deal if we see it?

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.750
Let's just march in there with our heads held high.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.020
Let's go.

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.260
- Get back here! - Hey. Stop right there!

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360
Freeze!

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.230
- Hey! - Hey. Get back here!

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Get back here.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.130
- Get back here. - Hey!

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:15.170
- Jong Hee. - Yes?

01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:16.699
I'm just going to run to the bathroom.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.640
- Go ahead. - I'll go on inside.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.680
(The viewing area is to the right.)

01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:25.710
Back then,

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:29.350
there was a thirst inside us that we couldn't bear unless we ran.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.389
Darn it.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:33.450
Not even knowing what it was we wanted,

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:36.260
but we couldn't bring ourselves to stop.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.290
It was like driving with no brakes.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.140
And at the end of that road,

01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.580
I met you.

01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:11.360
And that is how this story begins.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.630
(A Hundred Memories)

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:42.089
So did you end up meeting Giant or not?

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:44.190
I'm going to forget all about Giant.

01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:46.660
And I'm going to apply for that instead.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.759
Apparently, you need a diploma to be in the Miss Korea pageant.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.060
Gosh. Back to school.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.830
School.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:56.669
Hey. I'm planning a killer event.

01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:58.510
Let's go on a 4-on-4 group date.

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:00.570
A group date? Forget it.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.639
- What? - Aren't you a pretty little thing?

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.950
- Don't touch me! - Oh, my gosh.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.580
I've started keeping a diary lately.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.680
"Did something with Yeong Rye."

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.490
"It was fun. I was happy."

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.750
Words like those weren't really part of my vocabulary.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.090
But thanks to you, life's gotten a little more fun.

01:19:17.490 --> 01:19:20.560
Manager, can't you make just one exception?

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:30.040
