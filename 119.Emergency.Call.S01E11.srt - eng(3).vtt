And you are currently outside of City Port Building?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.910
Yes. I suddenly heard an explosion.

We can't head down to evacuate. Should we climb up instead?

- There should be another stairwell there.
- I see it.

Could I borrow you for a moment?

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.270
Based on the security footage,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.300
we believe this woman caused the explosion today.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.800
Isn't this...

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.020
Yes, "Michise Motoko."

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.670
But she was...

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.620
She was released from prison two months ago.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.870
Have you had any recent contact with her?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.900
Dojima-san.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.740
Revenge against Dojima-san? What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.190
Listening to this might make it easier to understand.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.260
It's a recorded call the Bureau submitted to court as evidence.

[Dispatcher: Dojima Shinichi]

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.880
An ambulance, please.
[Caller: Michise Motoko]

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.680
There's blood pouring out of my boyfriend's stomach.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.770
Was he injured by something?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.930
No, I stabbed him.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.440
You stabbed that individual?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.660
Yes, with a knife.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.130
I see. Could you please tell me where to send an ambulance?

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.720
You know, he promised.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.560
He promised me we'd be happy together, in this very room!

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.600
- But then he... he...
- Ma'am, please. I need your address.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.560
I'll have an ambulance sent right away.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360
[Dispatcher: Dojima Shinichi | Caller: Michise Motoko]

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.680
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.220
If you can’t give the exact address, just the complex name will do.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.980
Eventually,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.710
I managed to get an ambulance to their location.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.890
But by then, the man had already passed away.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.230
Michise Motoko was arrested and charged with murder.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.630
But in court, she claimed she never meant to kill her boyfriend,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.990
and she blamed his death on the dispatcher’s mishandling of the situation.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.330
No way...

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.000
Of course, her claims were dismissed

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.960
based on this recording and Dojima-san's testimony,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.570
and she was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.940
So she caused this explosion to get revenge.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.940
But how can you be so certain?

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.470
The police discovered that

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.850
Michise called 119 just before the explosion.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.880
Then, that call you received earlier...

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.270
I will now prove just how incompetent you people are.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.080
Michise is declaring war on us.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.130
Kasuhara-san?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.840
Kasuhara-san.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.580
Uesugi-kun...

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.290
Oh, right. You're here to check the site.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.790
She is the mother of the woman killed in the incident.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.970
Apparently, her daughter worked at the cafe where the explosion occurred.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.060
She was busy guiding customers out and missed the chance to escape herself.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.240
Akane!

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.230
- Thank you for your hard work.
- You too, thank you.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.030
- Thanks for your hard work.
- You, too.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.120
Kasuhara-san is checking our audio records

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.750
to see if Michise Motoko made any other calls.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.130
"Other calls"?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.550
I thought we concluded she never called from the same number.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.440
Right, but she says she might have called from different numbers.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.970
That means she’s relying solely on her voice.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.110
Well, it's possible for Kasuhara-san. She has sharp ears.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.260
See, I'm to be hospitalized, and...

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.220
Why does the ambulance always pass by my home?

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.470
Please tell them to take other streets—

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.140
I agree that's something only Kasuhara-san can do.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.020
But I'm honestly a bit worried about her.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.270
Agreed.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.110
You can hear a sound?

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.520
I'm home and it just keeps roaring,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.460
like a broken ventilation fan.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.340
No, it only sounds like a fan.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.890
I think it's technically called an infrasound.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.570
- This person...
- Anyway, I wish other people could hear it.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.250
Are you perhaps... Dojima-san?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.600
That would be me, yes.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.280
Thank goodness!
[Dispatcher: Dojima Shinichi]

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.780
I finally got to talk to you.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.860
Shall I send an ambulance your way?
[Dispatcher: Uesugi Subaru]

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.990
No, that's not it.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.530
What did you say your name was again?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.290
Team Leader!

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.790
These are other phone calls from Michise Motoko that I’ve found so far.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:45.200
She changed her tone of voice and the numbers she used, but I’m certain it’s her.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.070
You got these just from her voice?

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.280
At first, yes.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.140
But I’ve also found a common denominator.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:00.340
She asked for the dispatcher's name in every call.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.310
No, that's not it. What did you say your name was again?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.620
You're saying I'm calling only to complain?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.500
What's your name? Tell me your name.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.880
I'd guess you're still in your thirties, right?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.950
- Yes, I am.
- And what's your name?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.040
I believe it’s because she was looking for Dojima-san.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.600
Okay. I’ll consult our higher-ups on sharing this with the police.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.510
Please do.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.440
- Have a good one, Sir.
- Kasuhara.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.360
Where do you think you're going?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.040
I'm going to Kanzaki Station, in Minami Ward.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.900
We never received a call from there yesterday.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.980
You see right through me.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:00.900
This "Michise" always called from a different location.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.030
If these spots indicate her range of activity,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.260
it's likely the next incident could occur in this area's vicinity.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.770
The police are already after Michise.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.640
She may not even pull another stunt.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.300
We can't say she won't, either.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.170
So we must be ready.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.140
Where should the citizens evacuate

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.200
if a fire or explosion occurred right here, right now?

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.480
What if something happened to the children?

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.920
What if it was at a hospital?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.970
Or in a train station?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.850
What is it I can do?

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.170
Please help me.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.930
Help me...

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.280
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.970
- seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Mom,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.630
I’m sorry for leaving you alone and not coming home sooner.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.350
Mom, please! One, two, three...

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.070
Does she look disgruntled or in discomfort?

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.550
No, not at all.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.070
She's making no expression at all!

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.050
- One, two, three, four...
- They're here!

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.760
Okay. Please heed the paramedics' further instructions.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.180
I will.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.750
Kasuhara-san, you don't need to take the next call.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.200
You’ve been dealing with a series of intense calls.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.150
No, I'm totally fine.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.480
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.490
- Great work.
- Enjoy your break.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.920
Kasuhara-san.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.120
Sorry, thank you.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.170
Kasuhara-san!

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.550
I'm back.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.110
Are you sure you're okay?

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.590
Yes, I'm fine now.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.070
What did the doctor say was the reason for your dizzy spell?

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.740
Apparently, it was due to a lack of sleep.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.310
Next shift starts soon, right? I'll step in to make up lost hours.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.290
Kasuhara-san, wait.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.070
Kasuhara, head home for the day.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.550
You're running around on your days off, right?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.270
Then of course you've exhausted yourself.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.550
I understand you're worried.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.750
But there's no use being anxious.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.880
Dojima-san,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.930
how can you stay so normal?

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.220
As for me, I want to do whatever I can to help.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.510
I don't want something so unfair to ever happen again.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.990
None of us do!

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.910
But here's the thing.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.400
No human being can prevent all the world's absurdities and injustices.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.400
That's why we, as dispatchers,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.180
must respond to any situation calmly in order to save lives.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.430
But I... wasn't able to.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.800
That woman called for my help.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.670
She pleaded, and yet...

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.450
I...

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.550
I couldn't be like you, Dojima-san.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.270
If you'll excuse me.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.740
I should have noticed sooner how pressured she felt.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.430
- Will you have her skip our next shift too?
- Yes.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.440
She said she'd visit her parents for a while.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.570
Yuki, do you want coffee or tea?

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.310
We have a lot of pastries too.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.170
A new bakery opened in our neighborhood recently.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:29.260
I can somewhat understand how Kasuhara-san feels.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.220
We can take action

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.420
only after something has happened.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.190
Whether it's a fire or medical emergency,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.300
we are needed only when someone's life is at risk.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.490
It's hard to just wait while knowing

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.790
something horrible could happen at any time,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.110
especially since we dispatchers can't even go help directly.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.690
Careful. Careful.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.470
Kaneshita.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.620
Thanks for having me today.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.060
Horrible things could happen.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.450
Natural disasters are one of them.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.060
[Tsunami Evacuation Information]

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.420
They're unfair too.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:28.510
No one knows when they'll occur, and no one can stop them.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:35.120
Well, I'm not confident that I could stay as strong as Dojima-san.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.160
"I couldn't be like Dojima-san."

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.090
Kasuhara-san was saying that, too.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.210
I wonder what she meant by that.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.910
Maybe that's something only Kasuhara-san and the Legend will know.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.870
Sorry to visit unannounced.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.280
Did Mom fill you in?

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.230
Somewhat.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.750
I see.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.080
Really...

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.270
what am I even doing?

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.030
I became a dispatcher to save people,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.560
yet I'm causing trouble for those around me.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.850
And I’m the one receiving help.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.940
Yuki, you saved me.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.050
You saved me 25 years ago,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.930
and the other day too.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:07.510
Neither of those were because of anything I did.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.070
It was thanks to Dojima-san.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.920
And to you, for being there for that boy.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.010
But...

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.990
are there any lives...

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.150
that can be saved by one person alone?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.110
Your job as a dispatcher is to connect people, right?

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.630
That means...

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:49.300
on both sides of you,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.060
there are always people.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.420
There are things only you can do,

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:11.590
but there must also be many things you can't do alone.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.780
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.080
Or rather, thank you.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.910
- Were you able to rest up?
- Yes.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.280
Is Dojima-san here today?

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.970
He's getting checked at the hospital. He'll return when it's over.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.780
I see.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.820
I was actually told to pass this along to you.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.140
This is...
[To: The Yokohama Fire Bureau]

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.740

"is now a dispatcher herself"

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.320
"and is working hard to save lives."

"Don’t ever forget that miraculous connection."

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.860
"Sincerely, the Legend."

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.770
His words exactly.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.910
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.820
- Afternoon.
- Hey there.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.170
Folks, I have news to share.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.160
Take a look.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.540
Kanagawa Police have arrested the wanted Michise Motoko,

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.940
who was behind the City Port Building explosion that occurred on the 20th.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.580
Michise turned herself in

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.890
to the Yamashita Police Station at 9:30 a.m. today.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.740
Did she give up on trying to escape?

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.620
She has also confessed to being involved in the recent serial arsons

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.930
and is being questioned further by the Kanagawa police.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.920
That is all for our headlines for the hour.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.660
Then your motive was to get back at the Fire Bureau, is that it?

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.560
Yes.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.030
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.740
My throat... hurts like crazy.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.080
Do you have any other symptoms, like a fever or cough?

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.000
It's not like that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.160
It just started when I arrived at the mall, Yokohama Luminus.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.050
My two friends are having the same symptoms, too.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.920
The ones affected are you and your two friends, correct?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.430
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.530
Ambulance, please. Many of our customers are feeling unwell.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.490
Where shall I send the ambulance?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.090
"Big Beat," a restaurant on the 6th floor of Luminus.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.420
I've also received a report of multiple sick individuals at Luminus.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.980
How many are unwell, and what kind of symptoms do they have?

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.550
About twenty individuals, including myself.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.930
Our throats and eyes are hurting. Some are throwing up as well.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.760
Did any of you smell anything odd?

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.570
There’s a pungent or sharp smell.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.780
A sharp scent.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.550
And you smelled a pungent odor before feeling unwell?

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.840
Yes. It may be coming from our humidifier.
[Throat, Pungent odor]

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.270
"A humidifier"?

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.890
A customer complained that it was dry here,

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:10.530
so I checked our humidifier, and it was set to turn on in 30 minutes.
[Humidifier?]

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.790
It began to smell when I turned off the timer and had it run as normal.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.760
- I'm declaring this an NBC emergency.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.760
Get the SR Special Forces on this case as well.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.210
Kaneshita, contact Luminus's emergency management team

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.810
and have them evacuate people immediately.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.950
Yes, Ma'am.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.750
This is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.700
Dispatch Class-3, NBC. 1-1-2 Yokohama Luminus.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.140
Biochemical emergency. Dispatching...

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.730
All squads heading to Yokohama Luminus,

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.790
approximately twenty individuals are feeling unwell...

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.210
- Squads, ready!
- Yes, Sir!

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.650
- We're geared up!
- Copy that.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.030
The rescue squad will arrive shortly.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.110
Please call us again if any other issues arise.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.590
Almost all units covering the central area have been dispatched.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.650
This is Takachiho speaking.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.090
Yokohama Fire Bureau, this is Central. Come in.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.400
Go ahead, Captain.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.710
We believe the humidifier from "Big Beat" was emitting chlorine gas.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.510
We've already informed the police about this.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.670
Copy that, Central.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.660
"Chlorine gas"?

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.970
This is Captain Iida from Central speaking.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.690
This is Kaneshita from Command.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:39.110
Is this humidifier model used throughout the whole mall?

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.490
We have yet to confirm.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.370
According to the caller, this humidifier was set on a timer.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.700
The gas was likely planted to release at a specific time.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.460
We'll check right away.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.020
Understood.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.270
Who called?

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.870
The higher-ups had a message for us from the police.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.640
The terrorism occurring at Luminus...

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.420
was likely the work of Michise Motoko.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.360
They say she confessed to it herself.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.360
She turned herself in after setting the humidifiers' timers to release gas.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.460
That's why it was on a timer.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.580
Then she turned herself in so we'd let down our guard?

I don't have the exact address,

- That's in Central's area again.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.520

- How old is he?

- A-Am I doing this right?
- You have the right rhythm.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.850
- Press down with both hands
- One, two, three, four,

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.220
- so his chest goes in about 5 centimeters.
- five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.980
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.670
seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.650
This is rough!

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.910
- Hang in there! Help is on the way.
- One, two, three, four, five,

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.520
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.090
- You've got this.
- One, two, three, four,

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.390
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Yokohama Fire Bureau, this is Central. Come in.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.770
- Go ahead, Central.
- We've arrived in front of the cat cafe, "Tail."

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.860
A piece of debris was blocking the automatic door. Commencing rescue.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.420
- Copy that, Central.
- We'll open the door right away!

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.170
Please continue administering CPR until we make it in!

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.410
Kasuhara, the rescue squad has arrived.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.760
The rescue squad will be opening the door shortly.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.370
- Keep it up just a bit longer!
- Right!

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.700
One, two, three, four, five,

six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.370
Sir, are you all right?

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.260
H-He's conscious again!

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.950
Really?

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.920
Is he breathing?

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.090
Yes. Yes, he is!

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.550
We've reached the individuals in need!

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.530
Are you all right?

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.470
Help has arrived!

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.510
I hear them. Please heed their instructions to evacuate.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.410
You may end this call now.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.230
I understand. Thank you so much.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.440
- Thank you, Onee-san!
- Of course.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.840
- You've arrived at the hospital?
- Yes.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.590
From here, please follow the hospital staff's instructions.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:12.050
Yes, I will end our call now. Good day, Ma'am.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.650
Great job.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.300
The man is currently being transported to a hospital via chopper.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.050
Copy that.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.310
This is Takachiho speaking.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.010
Takachiho, it's me.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.660
Dojima-san? Where are you now?

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.980
And what are you doing?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.470
Have the SR Special Forces dispatched to our common lounge.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.390
The police, too.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.910
Another one of Michise's humidifiers was planted here.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.240
- What?
- Michise's real target was the Bureau.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.040
The NBC incident at Luminus was a diversion.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.680
No way...

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.640
However, I've already disabled it.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.830
No one is unwell either.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.340
As a precaution, I've had the citizens evacuated.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.150
Terribly sorry for the trouble.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.560
I understand. I'll have them sent here right away.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.770
Michise planted a humidifier in our lounge as well.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:23.180
Thankfully, the machine was disabled before it affected anyone.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.250
- Yogo-kun. Have the SR Special Forces dispatched here.
- Yes?

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.980
- I'll contact the police myself.
- Copy that.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.690
What an absolute legend.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.790
He suspected we were the target at that point.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.750
Michise Motoko was rearrested

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.460
for planting a humidifier at Yokohama Fire Bureau

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.190
to release chlorine gas.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.870
A similar incident took place at Yokohama Luminus Mall...

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.150
I can't believe

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.080
someone would go to such lengths.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.930
Events beyond our imagination

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.400
will surely happen again.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:19.220
But here's the thing. In our city...

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.350
there are many citizens

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.360
who are willing to save lives alongside us.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.800
[Dear Dispatchers working for the Yokohama Fire Bureau...]

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.750
Is that the man who fell into the sea the other day?

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.960
Yes. He recovered after some care in the hospital.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.310
Thank you for helping my boyfriend the other day.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:55.180
She was the one who helped us though.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.490
Say, Niijima-san.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:08.830
Even after you transfer to the paramedics...

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.700
Well, we might still talk to each other over the radio,

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.120
me as a dispatcher and you as a paramedic.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.470
Right.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.470
But we can chat about other things, can't we?

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.040
- What?
- Like, outside of work.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.140
Just send word, and I'll make time.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.720
Really? That'd be okay with you?

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.080
Why wouldn't it be?

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.290
Fair point.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.970
The other day, I finally came to understand

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.110
that I can't do anything alone.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:06.720
I can't save lives on my own.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:15.030
Dispatchers are the first to hear someone's cry for help.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.230
But dispatchers also have to listen

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.050
to those voices who want to help.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.730
That's why we'll be okay...

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.510
no matter what happens.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.140
We'll definitely be okay.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.450
And I have no doubts about that.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.870

Yes. I'm terrified of going to the office.

It's 39℃.
