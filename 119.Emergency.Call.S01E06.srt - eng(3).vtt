- A dispatcher?
- Yes.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.180
They're the people who answer 119 calls.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.180
I always think back to the person who answered my call

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.420
when our house caught on fire.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.730
His voice was kind and resolute too.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.590
I like to think his voice saved us.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.050
So I want to be there for someone in their time of need as well.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.660
Onee-chan?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.060
Then what about your job at the bank?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.410
I'd have to resign and change careers, I guess.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.270
But first, I must be a certified firefighter to become a dispatcher.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.090
Who thought I'd be studying for an exam at my age?

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.000
Certainly not me.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.650
Indeed. These look wonderful.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.630
I'll schedule another meeting when we further refine the design.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.440
[I'm sorry for the inconvenience I cause you with the meetings.]

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
No worries at all. I'll reach out again.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.980
[Yes, talk to you again.]

[Mom: Can I go through your things?]

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.630
We've decided to renovate the second floor.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.730
Since your childhood bedroom is as is, can I go through your things?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.690
[Got it. I'll go do it myself in the coming days.]

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940
As Squad 2 has informed us,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.290
we are getting many calls for winter-related emergencies.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.610
- Let us be ready for that.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.160
Now, who hasn't gone for a checkup yet?

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.920
I reckon you haven't either, Dojima-san.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.050
- I'll be fine.
- You're no exception, Sir.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.340
- Anyway, please schedule that as soon as possible.
- Yes, Ma'am.

- Good morning.
- Morning.

Allow me to introduce our newest dispatcher.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.700
This is Uesugi-kun. Starting today, he'll be joining our Squad 3.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.250
I'm Uesugi Subaru from Central Station. Pleased to meet you all.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.180
- The pleasure's ours.
- Now then, Tanaka-kun.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.160
Right. You are all aware of the "job rotation system"

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.870
we plan to implement for Yokohama Fire, yes?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.300
By periodically shifting people's posts and duties,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.420
we hope to further strengthen the bonds of those at the Bureau.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.940
In other words, Minowa-kun, you'll be his mentor.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.090
- Pardon?
- What?

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.620
But I completed my four days of training.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.670
Training never prepares you for the real deal.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.490
I see.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.750
All right, everyone. Let's get to today's work.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.100
Yes, Ma'am.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.740
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?
- A car hit a bike.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.630
The woman cycling was knocked into the road.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.240
- This is an accident?
- Yes.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.100
- May I get your location?
- Yokohama 305, He-12-something.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.700
That's all I remember.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.350
- Sir, is that a license plate number?
- Yes.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.090
The car drove off. Should I contact the police?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.720
We will contact them on our end. Can I first get an address?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.330
We'd like to send an ambulance right away.

Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.330
I believe it'd be a medical emergency.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.570
What seems to be the matter?

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.640
M-My mother. She tripped and hit her head as we left the house.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.340
She can't seem to move. Can we request an ambulance?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.550
Yes, Ma'am. Please tell us where to send the ambulance.

I was trying to fry some tempura when the whole pot went up in flames.

I have it here: 5-20 Sasadocho, Kounan Ward.

- And whose residence is this?
- Mine, Morikawa.

[Building Fire | Dispatch]

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.310
I've sent our firefighters your way. Is your pot the only thing on fire?

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.990
Y-Yes. Should I pour water on it?

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.520
No, that would be extremely dangerous.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.290
Do you have a fire extinguisher on hand?

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.110
- No, if I had one, I'd be using it!
- I see.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.400
- Uesugi-kun...
- Do you have a towel or spare bedsheet?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
- I have a towel.
- Run that towel under water,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.800
and wring it out.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.830
Sure. One moment.

Make sure the towel covers the whole pot.

Once you've wrung it out, place it on the pot.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.740
I have the towel ready.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.310
Please cover the entire pot with that towel.

Yes, and it's always because he can't move at the crossing on Yamashita Bridge.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.590
Oh, well...

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.040
Where are you right now?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.530
In my bathtub.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.280
So you are home.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.780
In that case, could I please get your address?

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.480
Kasuhara, not yet.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.300
- What?
- Room 403, 4-7 Yuunagicho, Isogo Ward.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.920
Promise me you'll come, okay?

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.450
- I'll end things on my end, too.
- No, wait!

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.470
- I get it now, I...
- Call her back.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.720
Yes, Sir.
[Return Call]

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.780
Send out the Isogo paramedics.
[Central Control]

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.440
Their sirens could push her to act.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.360
Have them informed of every update we get.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.720
All right.
[Dispatch]

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.450
The number you have called is...

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.790
This is the Isogo paramedic squad.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.370
[Calling]

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.960
- We have lost contact with the individual.
- Please... pick up.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.840
We have no read on the current situation.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.610
Understood.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.280
Kasuhara, when she picks up, prioritize calming her down.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.870
Yes, Sir.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.290
Hello?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.670
It's me, the lady from the Fire Bureau you spoke to earlier.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.710
Right now, are you...

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.280
No, I mean.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.930
I...

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.560
I'm sorry.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.060
Pardon?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.970
Earlier, I kept asking questions

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.980
without listening to your side of the story.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.960
If you wouldn't mind,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.170
could you please tell me more about yourself?

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.580
I'll be here to listen.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.470
This is Yokohama Fire. We copy that.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.060
Misotatsu-san walked home without taking the ambulance.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.730
Understood.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.020
Geez, seriously?

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.920
You don't have to force yourself to speak if you're not up to it.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.260
But I'll continue this call, just in case.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.640
Ma'am, I'm okay now.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.110
Your call has calmed me down.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.620
Really?

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.750
Yes.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.780
I won't need an ambulance anymore.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.840
Okay.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.620
Just call us again if anything happens, okay?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.050
I will.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.640
Then I'll end our call here.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.810
Is it really our job to handle such things?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.440
Was that your first call from someone contemplating suicide?

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.190
Yes, Ma'am.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.400
I panicked.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.840
All I could think about was locating her.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.380
If I had been more levelheaded about the situation...

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.680
But you were able to prevent the worst from happening.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.590
Those results are far more important

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.280
than any fruitless chase you send paramedics on.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.390
Remember, sympathizing with our callers

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.990
is essential in this line of work.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.290
Yes, Ma'am.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.360
What are you so upset about?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.590
You send our paramedics out for the most inane calls.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.150
I didn't realize counseling was part of the job too.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.800
If the caller needs that support, we give it.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.540
You must be joking.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.220
So you'll act all sympathetic, too?

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.670
If you humor every last call, you'll see no end to it.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.970
You have to assert yourself.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.110
You have to express care when listening to people.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.260
"Express care"?

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.730
This job's hard because things aren't so clear cut.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:29.760
A method that works for one caller may not fly for another.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.990
There's no right answer for dealing with these calls.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.370
So you're dispatching our squads with that indecisive attitude?

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.090
I don't get it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.280
- Please tell us where to send the ambulance.
- I understand.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.820
I see.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.850
- Your abdomen is in pain.
- Yes.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.010
Yes.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.510
When did the pain begin?

00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:00.340
Two hours ago. But I haven't been able to push any out in a week.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.490
Push out what, Sir?

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.320
You know, a really big one...

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.260
[Muted]

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.290
Sir, this guy is just constipated.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.260
Being constipated for a week is no joke.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.450
Continue the call.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.620
Will you be needing an ambulance?

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.920
Y-Yes, please! I-I've never felt this much pain before...

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.530
Let's send him one.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.220
We will send an ambulance your way. May I have an address please?

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.850
An address? Right.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.220
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.180
It hurts. Wh-What do I do?

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.230
What seems to be the matter?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.080
Ma'am, remain calm.
[Breathing...]

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.940
My heart is beating so fast. Am I...

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.170
Ma'am, remain calm. Do you know your current location?

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.920
[Listen In]

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.030
Are there any landmarks, or...

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.450
Ma'am, let's take some deep breaths.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.280
O-Okay.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.420
Slowly breathe in...

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.320
And breathe out.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.950
You're doing great.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.710
When you're able to speak,

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:32.400
may I get your name and age?

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.840
Yes. My name is Koda.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.400
Koda-san, it's okay. I'm right here with you.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.820
I will send an ambulance your way.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.070
Do you know where you are?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:56.190
Th-This is my first time in Yokohama.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.660
I came for an interview.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.530
Let's figure out where you are together.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.810
Don't worry, I'm in no rush.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.010
O-Okay, I'd appreciate that.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.290
[Pedestrians and bicycles only]

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.340
[7-5-1 Minatomirai, Nishi Ward]

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.990
This is it.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.170
It hurts. Wh-What do I do?

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.160
Koda-san, it's okay. I'm right here with you.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.550
I will send an ambulance your way.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.550
Do you know where you are?

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.350
Th-This is my first time in Yokohama.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.300
I-I came for an interview.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.450
She was in a new place, surrounded by other interviewees.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.380
She must have been incredibly anxious.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.850
Sympathizing with people is easier said than done.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.460
What?

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.850
Your sister says she's coming home today.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.820
- Look what I found.
- Oh, my.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.100
How nostalgic.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.510
- You remember when she drew this, right?
- Of course.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.640
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home!

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.630
Did you finish sorting through your room?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.940
You'll be eating dinner with us, right?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.750
I'm home. Is Onee-chan back already?

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.760
We haven't had family dinner in a while. I thought it'd be nice.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.460
Onee-chan!

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.900
[I have a deadline today. I'll be heading out.]

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.370
I see.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.160
Wait, before you go!

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.440
Make sure you eat well, okay?

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.580
Take care now.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:49.620
I thought we could have a family dinner with all four of us.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.620
She looked busy. Nothing we can do about that.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.040
And how about you, Yuki?

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.570
Is work going well?

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.040
I'm not sure, but I'm certainly doing my best.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.940
I'm blessed with great Senpais and supervisors.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.290
That's good to hear.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.580
- This was the job you wanted to pursue, after all.
- True.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:22.270
I wanted to tell Onee-chan that I am doing well...

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.850
I'm sure you're busy, but be sure to visit every now and then, all right?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.940
I will.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.320
We could've just talked over the phone.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.340
You want to ask about Uesugi, right?

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.850
I heard from a guy in General Affairs.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.130
You're the one who pushed him to the Command Center, Iida. Why?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.580
Uesugi's been on my squad for two years now.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.060
It's great that he takes action during an emergency,

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.530
but it's like he's gotten too used to it.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.630
- You can tell, right?
- Yes.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.710
It's a dangerous rookie mindset to have.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.240
He needs to learn that those on the frontlines

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.410
aren't the only stars of the show.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.430
Your two draft beers.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.700
Enjoy.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.300
Cheers.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.850
So, how do you feel as the pioneer?

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.840
- Of what?
- This job rotation business.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.970
I'm not on rotation.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.390
You don't feel like returning to the squad?

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.540
It's not a matter of whether I feel like returning or not.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.660
So that incident still gets to you.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.370
That accident wasn't your fault, all right?

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.080
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.890
A medical emergency...

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.460
What seems to be the matter?

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.810
I'm at work, and my boss was...

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.990
What happened to your boss, Sir?

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.990
Th-There's blood...

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.440
So he's bleeding, yes? And where is he bleeding from?

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.030
H-His chest.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.780
"His chest"? He's bleeding from his chest?

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.420
Yes.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.930
Do you know why he's bleeding from his chest?

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.880
Hello, Sir? Could you please tell us what's going on?

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.300
- He was...
- Pardon?

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.260
He was stabbed.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.180
- What?
- He's calling from Minami-no-Dai, Totsuka Ward.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.710
- Contact the police.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.350
He was stabbed?

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.960
Your boss was stabbed in the chest?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.010
Calm down. First, make sure the caller is safe.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.860
Is he conscious? Do you know if he's conscious or not?

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.520
And could you tell me your address?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.140
No, I...

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.230
Then the company's name. You know that much, right?

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.160
- Well...
- Uesugi, he might not be able to speak.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.680
Why don't you know? He was stabbed, right?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.680
We need to send him an ambulance now!

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.880
I'll take over from here.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.480
Sir, I will be handling your call.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.300
There are several questions I'd like to ask.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.070
You may respond with a simple "yes" or "no."

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:31.650
If that is also risky, a "yay" or "nay" will also work.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.620
Is the individual who stabbed your boss still in the vicinity?

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.200
Yay.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.010
Are you, the caller, currently in a safe location?

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.090
Nay.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.470
- The perpetrator is nearby?
- Yes.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.580
Can you move to safety?

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.810
No.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.960
Damn it...

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.760
I have a couple more questions.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.990
Your boss is a man, correct?

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.360
Yes.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.050
Is he still conscious?

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.850
No...

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.690
Dojima-san.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.830
These are stores in that area.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.130
From first to last, there's an eatery, pharmacy, and used car dealership.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.840
[Yoi no Toki Eatery, Daio Pharmacy, S and Company Dealership]

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.720
Is your establishment a used car dealership, Sir?

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.620
- Yes.
- "S and Company," perhaps?

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.100
Yeah!

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.770
[S and Company]

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.840
Understood.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.450
I'm sending an ambulance and some police your way.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.930
You may either stay on this line

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.150
or hang up if you feel you are in danger.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.110
Okay.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.090
The caller is still in immediate danger.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.040
Please be wary when approaching the facility.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.270
We'll probably get questions from the press.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.610
I'll let General Affairs know.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.370
That was a difficult case. I don't blame you.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.230
An employee of the used car dealership "S and Company"

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.790
- called 119 at 5:30 a.m.,
- Oh, there's the news.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:25.670
reporting that his boss had been stabbed in the chest.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.380
The suspect was soon arrested at the scene of the crime.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.870
The victim, Chief Shikata Yoshinori,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.180
was transported to a hospital,

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.840
but he unfortunately lost his life.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.680
Though the dealership was open and several staff were present,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.810
there were no other casualties or injuries.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:49.120
Police are currently looking into possible motives, and...

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.760
Do you know the scariest part of this job?

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.730
Giving in to self-conceit.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.470
"Self-conceit"?

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.600
No matter how experienced or used to this you are,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.960
no two calls can be handled the same.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.830
Knowing that and actually understanding makes all the difference.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:37.170
I'm sorry for my actions earlier, Sir.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.900
Uesugi.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.500
You underestimate human beings.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.120
Pardon?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.860
Getting a hundred calls means a hundred unique individuals are seeking help.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.920
You've only lived twenty-some years.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.790
You can't handle each of those cases perfectly.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.280
Yes, Sir.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.360
I've lived a little over sixty years and still get caught off guard.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.900
Then what should I do?

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.980
You listen.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.230
Listen to the caller's voice

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.100
and surrounding sounds.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:24.370
You imagine the situation they're in

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.340
and find the best words to say,

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.090
all while praying you've made the right move.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:38.860
Repeat that cycle and hone your dispatching skills.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.070
That's really all you can do.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.760
Sleep when you can, okay?

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.910
These nights tend to get long.

Hello, what seems to be the issue?

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.710
I was hit by a man.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.250
And I'm bleeding from my face.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.390
Where should I send an ambulance?

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.110
Where? I'm busy running away!

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.590
So you're outside, running from the man who hit you?

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.440
Yes, from a guy who calls himself my ex.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.680
"Calls himself your ex"...

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.310
Where'd you go?

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.950
Oh no, he's close!

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.420
He started throwing punches after I rejected him.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.360
What sort of 38-year-old asks out a teen? He's insane!

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.750
Have you called the police?

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.150
No, no way. I ran away from home!

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.520
Got it.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.090
So you want to take an ambulance to the hospital.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.080
Are you still running?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.370
I don't have an address, but I'm hiding between a small shop

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.060
and hardware store near Yamashita Park.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.860
I think that dude is nearby, too.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.520
Meaning he'd find you if we send an ambulance...

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.270
Can't you turn off the siren or something?

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.380
We actually can't.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.990
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.580
Oh, ouch! I can't walk!

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.260
Send an ambulance right away!

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.470
Did you perhaps call us earlier, Sir?

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.700
Yes, it's me, Misono. Now hurry!

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.410

Of course, I am!

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:53.280
I wanted to go enjoy the night breeze, but now I can't move!

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.570
May I ask where you are?

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.930
I'm at my usual crossing!

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.570
- The one at Yamashita Bridge, in Naka Ward.
- Got it.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.670
I will send an ambulance your way.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.430
Please wait and remain safe.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.040

Hold on. Misotatsu-san calls for an ambulance along Yamashita Bridge, right?

Yes.

Yes, I think I'm nearby.

So how about it? Can you run?

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.910
Yes, I think so.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.580
Then run toward Marine Tower.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.030
Okay.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.850
Tell me when you start to hear a siren.

No way, I hear it!

- Sir, the ambulance is about to arrive.
- Sorry!

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.990
I'm not hurting anymore, so I'll head home.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.610
Feel free to call off the ambulance.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.860
Is that so? I understand.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.000
Central Paramedic, this is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

A girl is headed your way.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.860
Please take her to the nearest hospital when she arrives.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.440
Copy that.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.170
I see it! I see the ambulance!

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.840
Go ahead and run on in.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.740
Come onboard.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.510
I'm in! I'm in the ambulance!

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.120
Holy cow, I've never been in an ambulance before!

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.230
I'm glad you made it. Take care, okay?

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.060
Thank you, Onee-san! I'll never forget what you did for me today!

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.030
- Then I'll go ahead and end this call.
- Okay!

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.910
That was amazing, Team Leader.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.710
I didn't even know that was allowed.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.310
I'm surprised it worked out.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.910
Honestly, I thought we were done for.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.780
It's amazing.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.170
I'm sorry for my attitude yesterday.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.520
I look forward to learning more today.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.930
Not to worry, we've sent an ambulance your way.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.570
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:16.790
It's my husband. We're currently home, and he says his stomach hurts.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.370
He's drenched in sweat as well.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.350
I understand.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.720
May I get your name and an address, please?

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.580
Oh, but my husband has locked himself in our bathroom

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.690
and insists he doesn't need an ambulance.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.490
I see. If your husband refuses an ambulance,

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.210
we can't force him to take one.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.710
Right, I had assumed.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:44.020
If you're worried, would you like me to speak to your husband directly?

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.500
No, no need to trouble yourself.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.650
- Are you sure? Just to be safe...
- No need to push them.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.020
They'll call again if they really need our assistance.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.500
Okay. Then I will not send an ambulance.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.950
But please don't hesitate to call 119 again.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.000
- I won't.
- I will be ending this call.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.520
All right.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.280
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.170
- Well, excuse me, we're in a taxi now.
- I see.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.450
M-My wife... It seems her water broke.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.650
Understood.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.490
Could I please get your wife's age and your name, Sir?

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:23.380
I'm Imai. My wife is 38.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.060
Imai-san, right?

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.990
How many weeks along is your wife?

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.090
- Is this her first pregnancy?
- Yes, it's her first.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.290
We are still a month from her due date.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.750
Okay. We will send an ambulance your way.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.930
Please have the taxi driver park to the side.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.120
Once they've parked, please tell us where you are.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.000
I'm sorry, but we're currently on the highway.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.640
- "The highway"?
- Yes.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.740
Do you know how far you are from the nearest exit, parking or service area?

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.500
One moment. What is it?

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.520
- It hurts... Yes.
- It's coming?

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.760
I'm sorry. My wife says she's in pain.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.220
- Contractions...
- She's saying her contractions may have begun!

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.710
- "Her contractions"?
- Yes.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.200
She's in incredible pain.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.560
If she's already that far along, childbirth may happen quickly,

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.280
maybe in the next hour or two.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.760
- Imai-san.
- Yes?

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.800
Could you put your phone on speaker and ask the driver where you currently are?

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.310
One moment.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.160
Sir, where are we right now?

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.870
We're 5 kilometers from Daikoku Junction.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.750
But traffic's jamming up...

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.440
Along the Bayshore or Daikoku Route?

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.240
Bayshore. We're headed east.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.370
Understood.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.700
We'll have an ambulance on standby at the Daikoku Pier exit.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.120
[Dispatch]

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.720
- Are you okay?
- It hurts so much!

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.570
- Imai-san.
- Yes?

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.440
Sir, is your wife all right?

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.640
No, it...

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.750
It's out. The head is out!

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.600
- The baby's head?
- Yes.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.090
- The baby's head is out!
- Okay.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.930
The baby's head is out.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.970
Niijima-san.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.970
- Make sure the hospital's ready for them .
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.350
She may give birth before they reach the ambulance.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.550
- Tsurumi Paramedic Squad 1, this is Yokohama Fire.
- What?

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.060
Let's do what we can.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.640
- Imai-san.
- Yes?

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.240
Listen and do not panic.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.310
We'll deliver the baby in the vehicle.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.210
- What? Here?
- Yes.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.240
If the baby's head is already out,

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.410
we have to get it breathing before arriving at the ambulance.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.650
No, but...

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.750
I will drive as fast and carefully as possible.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.640
Do your best!

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.510
You may keep me on the line.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.960
Let's do our best together!

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.640
Okay. I'd appreciate any assistance.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.140
Right.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.310
- Contact her OB-GYN doctor as well.
- Copy that.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.680
This is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.860
- Our patients are 1.3 km from the exit.
- Breathe in.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.340
- Breathe out.
- Breathe out.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.350
- Big breath in.
- Big breath in.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.120
- And push.
- And push!

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.860
The ambulance has made it to the Daikoku Pier exit.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.200
- Breathe in.
- Breathe in.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.170
- Breathe out.
- Breathe out.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.610
- Big breath in.
- Big breath in.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:22.730
- And push again.
- And push again!

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.020
Ma'am.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.840
Ma'am, you can do this.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.340
We're all here with you!

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.170
We're 1 kilometer away.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.970
You can do this!

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.350
You can do this! Push through!

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:44.620
I am pushing!

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.260
Right, s-sorry!

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.130
Let's take a quick break.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.260
Relax, Ma'am.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.580
I can't! Please just let me get this over with!

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.250
Okay. Then let us continue.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.300
Breathe in.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.460
Breathe out.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.150
Big breath in.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.390
And push!

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.320
The baby's upper body is out! Almost there!

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.570
What?

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.930
The baby! The baby's born!

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.040
Is it crying?

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.190
Imai-san, is your baby crying?

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.130
Crying?

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.380
N-No, the baby isn't crying!

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.430
Why?

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.380
- Have the husband lightly hit the baby's back.
- All right.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.930
- Imai-san.
- Yes?

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.010
Can you lightly hit the baby's back for us?

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.000
What? Hit?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.140
But it's so small...

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.820
With my hand? Finger?

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.250
The palm of your hand, Sir.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.460
If only we could clear the baby's airway.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.800
But they don't have any tools. How...

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.760
It's crying.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.740
The baby is crying!

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.770
Can you hear? The baby is crying!

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.300
I hear the baby loud and clear!

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.770
I'm taking the exit!

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:32.880
Just a bit farther!

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.200
The ambulance is on standby right at the exit.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.330
Hamae City Hospital is ready for them.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.530
I see it.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.300
I see the ambulance!

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.580
Please park the taxi behind the ambulance.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.210
The paramedics will handle the rest.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.640
Thank you. Thank you!

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.430
Thank you for cooperating.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.980
And congratulations on your healthy baby.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.200
Thank you.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.360
Are you crying?

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.040
No.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.150
Of course not.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.200
â™« If only I had been able to forget â™«

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.620
- Great work in there.
- You, too.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.140
I know you're still a rookie like me, but you're somewhat my Senpai.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.010
May I ask you anything I don't know?

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.370
How could that be?

00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:00.610
If anything, I'd like to ask you what it's like to be an active firefighter.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.750
How about we trade information then?

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.760
Good idea.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.580
See you both tomorrow.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.660
See you, Sir.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.580
Kaneshita-san.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.620
What?

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:15.150
Though I may not be here long, I look forward to learning under your guidance.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.820
Hope you learn that rescue squads aren't the only stars.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.730
Pardon?

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.920
But I admit I realized that only recently myself.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.830
Anyway, good luck at the next department you're sent to.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.700
What? I'm being rotated somewhere else?

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.680
Maybe you'll head to General Affairs.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.730
Have Tanaka Senpai teach you.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.460
I wasn't informed of this!

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.640
Or maybe you'll be sent to the Command Center again!

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.670
Wait, you're serious?

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.860

Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

Requesting a search and rescue.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.720
An 11-year-old boy has been reported missing by his father in the Sasanodai Forest.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.770
- I wanted to assuage their guilt, even just a little.
- A promotion?

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.080
I've always had high aspirations.
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.390

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:46.190
If yes, then please tap the phone once.

Sorry, I'm driving and can't get a good look.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:52.500
Could you possibly go speak to this girl?

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.720
No way!

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.030
Sorry, the folks behind me are honking.
