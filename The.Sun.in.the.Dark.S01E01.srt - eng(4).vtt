=Episode 1=

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.379
(I'm Bai Xiaoying.)

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.459
(Since childhood,
they called me cursed.)

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.579
(My blood corrodes all it touches.)

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.139
Her blood... Monster!
Your daughter's a monster!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.460
She's ill-omened! She'll kill us all!

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.379
Night Clan filth!

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.879
Night Clan filth! Get out!

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.020
Stop contaminating us! Leave now!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.340
Evil Night Clan spawn!

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.259
Mother, am I truly cursed?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340
Am I from Night Clan?

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.939
Will they only be content when I'm dead?

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.740
Xiaoying, you're my daughter.
You're never cursed.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.539
Even for my sake,
live to prove them wrong.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.860
Kill her!

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.819
Kill her!

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.800
What's that?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.060
Night Deity!

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.340
Night Deity comes!

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.379
Run!

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.259
Xiaoying!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.240
Xiaoying!

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.300
I'm here, Xiaoying.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.620
Mother? Mother? Mother!

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.300
Mother! Mother! Mother!

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.699
Mother! Mother! Mother!

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:52.780
Who are you? How are you still alive?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.699
You're Night Deity?

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.180
You killed my mother. Give her back!

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.099
What if I refuse?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.780
Then I'll kill you and avenge my mother!

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.740
While I breathe, I'll hunt you down.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.420
Then live.
I'll await your feeble attempts.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.540
(Remember, I'm Ye Chenyuan.)

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.500
Night Deity!

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.180
(I will survive)

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.740
(and slay Night Deity
to avenge my mother.)

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.660
(My only path
is to ascend the Immortal Steps,)

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.259
(reach an immortal sect,
and cultivate immortal arts.)

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.699
(If I fail, let death claim me here.)

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:42.300
Yunya, see the mortal on Immortal Steps?
She has no immortal root.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.980
Yet she climbed this far alive.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.899
Countless seek immortality.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.540
She's the first mortal
in thirty millennia to reach here.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.939
Still mortal, though.
She'll perish on these steps.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.519
Her resolve is extraordinary.
She'll make something.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.639
I'll take her and let her serve
as a cleaner in Yunxiu Pavilion.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
(It's her.)

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.279
You survived?

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.480
Stay back.
My blood harms all it touches.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.779
I'm cursed.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.040
The anomaly must have
brought you endless trials.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.079
Yet you warn me first despite your pain.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.439
You are kind and never cursed.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.199
This is Clear Spirit Ring,
an artifact I forged.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.560
It will seal your abnormal energies.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.399
You can live normally from now on
and fear no more.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.439
Are you an immortal?

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.759
I vow to slay Night Deity
to avenge my mother.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.639
Can you help me?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.199
Destroying Night Deity
is the immortal sects' duty.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.360
Live to witness his downfall.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.600
You truly are immortal.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.680
We finally meet again.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.139
Why risk death pursuing cultivation?

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.019
To kill Night Deity.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.019
Without immortal roots,
you'll never ascend.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:36.299
Then why save me?

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.980
Because I've never seen your equal.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.019
A mortal conquering Immortal Steps
is truly remarkable.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:54.139
Take me as a disciple.
Teach me immortal arts

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.259
to slay Night Deity.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.059
I'm Yunya, an Upper Immortal
of Nine Heavens. Call me Master.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.299
But it's a temporary arrangement.
You need to prove your worth.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:17.659
Thank you, immortal.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.379
No. Thank you, Master.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:29.039
Why are we having
cultivation training again today?

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:31.659
What's wrong with that?
We get to see Master again today.

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.460
My cultivation is so weak.
I'll just end up getting punished again.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.919
Not like you.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.580
Senior, can you lend me your artifact?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.800
No.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.160
Don't be so stingy. Just this once.

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:47.860
What's this awful smell?
It's disgusting.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.899
It's that filthy cleaner.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:53.280
She reeks. It's suffocating.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.139
How can we study like this?

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.559
Exactly. So repulsive.

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:01.379
I'm sorry, Senior.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.700
We humans just smell.
No amount of washing helps.

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:06.659
I'll try to stay further away
from you all.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.379
Uncouth and vulgar.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.700
Just a mortal without an immortal bone.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.700
How did such trash enter Nine Heavens
and get to sit beside us?

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.659
It's because Master Yunya
is kind-hearted and treats all equally.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.700
He tolerates even such abnormalities.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.799
I just can't stand it.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:24.080
(To practice immortal arts,)

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:26.559
(I'll avoid conflicts
whenever possible.)

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.180
Master is here.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.540
Master.

00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:49.659
- Master.
- Master.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:01.159
With Night Clan attacking Mortal Realm,
you must intensify your training.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:03.904
How's your Water Condensation?

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.320
Let me try, Master.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
As expected of Senior Wanyan.
She's mastered it already.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.360
Wanyan, teach us too.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.080
All hail our Lord!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.399
My cultivation has reached its peak.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.919
I'll seize the Divine Sword
from the immortal sects now.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.320
Nothing in this world
can threaten me anymore.

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:17.080
What's this?

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:22.460
(No. When did I drop it?)

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:28.259
Master, I found this filthy object.
It seems to be mortal.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.460
Who owns this?

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.840
If no one claims it,

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:36.100
then Bai Xiaoying,
the cleaner, shall be punished.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.120
Punish Bai Xiaoying.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.019
Right. You should've cleaned properly.

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:43.299
Yunxiu Pavilion is Master's residence.
How dare you taint it?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.360
Master's kindness breeds negligence.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.299
(Disaster strikes today.)

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:53.399
(I can't escape it.)

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960
It's mine.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.759
Master, I... I didn't know.

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.200
No worries.
I made this during mortal travels.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.559
It's old. The clasp must've loosened.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.759
No matter how hard I practice,
I can't match their casual attempts.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.860
Bai Xiaoying, how will you
defeat Night Deity like this?

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:48.499
Xiaoying.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.040
Master.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.000
I've fixed it.
Be more careful next time.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.879
I'll remember your teachings.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.879
Thank you for helping me today, Master.

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:18.039
In this immortal sect,
avoiding trouble is best.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:19.720
Better than courting disaster.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.320
Okay.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360
I'm here.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:40.899
What's this thing?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.019
Night Deity is coming.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.799
Immortals, heed my command.
Destroy Night Deity!

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.740
Night Deity is here! To battle!

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.580
Hurry!

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.179
Night Deity, I've waited long for this.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.259
Night Deity, long time no see.

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:25.179
Immortal Lord, still kicking?

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:44.160
He wants Divine Sword!

00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:06.780
Mother, it's him.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.720
My long-awaited day has come.

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:20.720
No, if he takes Divine Sword,

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:23.120
nothing can destroy him anymore!

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.600
(My blood corrodes all. Maybe...)

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.200
Try my Soul-Binding Rope!

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.879
Die!

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:47.919
My Soul-Binding Rope!

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:04.119
Ye Chenyuan was drawn
into Divine Sword. Is he sealed now?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.099
That demon must still resist.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.940
Stay vigilant.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.900
Ye Chenyuan!

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.799
Who are you?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.519
Don't remember me?

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:45.279
I'm your killer.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.759
Seeking death!

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.000
You scoundrel!

00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:01.359
I'll slice you to pieces!

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.740
Who are you?
Why does Divine Sword obey you?

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.540
Not sure myself.

00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:34.539
But it's perfect.
I want you to be shredded to dust.

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.859
Seems hatred manifests here.

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:51.980
I suggest abandoning evil intentions.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.180
Or you'll die first.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.460
My mother's killer stands here.
How can I not hate?

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.019
My patience ends now.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.579
(What did you do? Get out of me!)

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.340
Silence.

00:19:29.059 --> 00:19:32.640
I should've used this sooner.
It spares the chitchat.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.339
(Really? Me too.)

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.380
What are you doing?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.859
(Mother, I'll avenge you.)

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.920
You've truly gone mad.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.200
But I won't die that easily.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.580
What?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720
Did Night Deity escape
from the Divine Sword?

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.640
Night Deity has always been cunning.
We must heighten our guard.

00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:17.856
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:33.119
So I've returned to the Nine Heavens?

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:47.859
Why are you out here too?

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:53.420
I won't waste words with you.
I need to reclaim my physical form.

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:56.460
(So he's only in spirit form now.)

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.579
(I'll take him to Master now.)

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.539
Someone! Capture Night Deity!

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.819
Is anyone here? Night Deity is here!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.488
- Catch Night Deity!
- Night Deity?

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:08.539
Someone!

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.960
- Help! Night Deity is here!
- Xiaoying.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.540
Master.

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:17.140
You mentioned Night Deity.
Do you know where he is?

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.460
(Can't they see Night Deity?)

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.940
Xiaoying, what are you doing here alone?

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.980
I'm alone? Night Deity...

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.280
(What are you doing?)

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.440
If you tell him about me,
I'll kill him instantly.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.480
(Don't threaten me.)

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.240
(Without a physical form,
you can't defeat Nine Heavens.)

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:56.839
I welcome mutual destruction. At least
I can kill you and your master first.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.079
One light stab...

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.199
No!

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.599
Xiaoying, what's wrong?

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:05.400
You can tell me anything.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.900
It's nothing.

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:15.619
I just heard Night Deity came
and searched everywhere for him.

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:17.579
By accident, I flew here.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.599
Why did you shout
about capturing Night Deity?

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.319
I... I heard Night Deity
attacked the Nine Heavens.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.679
I just wanted to practice harder
to support Night Deity...

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.760
No. Support you all.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.480
Master, you must station heavy guards
at the forbidden area.

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:43.240
My cultivation is weak. My entering
the forbidden area would be disastrous.

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.159
Nonsense!

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.779
How can you take such a matter lightly?

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.140
Master, she nearly
breached the forbidden area.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:55.200
In my opinion, twenty flogging strikes
will deter future offenses.

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:58.980
Yes. Senior Wanyan is right.
Bai Xiaoying should be punished.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.820
Right.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.440
Senior Wanyan is correct.
Please discipline me, Master.

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:16.019
Someone, flog Bai Xiaoying twenty times.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.220
Yes.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.080
Careful.

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:34.639
Slow down.

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:38.400
I'm fine. Don't help me.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.720
Go back first.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.400
It's okay. I must see you inside.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.760
Let's go.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.119
If Wanyan sees you, she'll target you.
I don't want to owe you favors.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.839
Xiaoying, what's happening?

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:59.559
This place remains as shabby as ever.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.839
(As shabby as ever?)

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.940
(Could he be Night Deity the Master
mentioned who was imprisoned here?)

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.519
Xiaoying? Xiaoying?

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:14.599
You're injured and still this energetic?

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.079
Xiaoying, slow down.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.440
Slowly. Take it easy.

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:23.679
Sit slowly. Easy now.

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:29.599
I told you to walk slowly.
Let me check your wounds.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.200
The wounds have reopened.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.599
Take off your clothes.
I'll get medicine.

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:37.919
Don't bother.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640
(He's bound to me.)

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:43.839
(If something happens
to me alone, no one will know.)

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.960
I'll trouble you then.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.359
Okay.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.619
Why are you still here?

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.740
I'm taking off my clothes.

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:08.460
Tell me how to untie this.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.019
You won't stay here forever, will you?

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.580
Listen.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:22.140
Until I reclaim my body, get the sword,
and break the Soul-Binding Rope,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.180
you'd better accept reality quietly.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.619
Otherwise, I'll make you
suffer unbearably.

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:31.379
You...

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.859
Xiaoying, why haven't you
taken off your clothes?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.220
I... I'll get on the bed.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.640
Rourou, can you
lower the curtains for me?

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.000
Why? It's just us here.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:04.240
I haven't been well lately.
I'm sensitive to chills.

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:06.399
