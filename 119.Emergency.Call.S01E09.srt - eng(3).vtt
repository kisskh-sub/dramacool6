WEBVTT

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.990
That concludes my announcements for the day.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.300
One more thing before we get started.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.550
Dojima-san's procedure has been scheduled for today.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.180
He says, "Don't come checking up on me. Focus on your work!"

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880
- So, let's get to it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.750
Team Leader Takachiho, there was one more thing on the docket.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.400
Right, I almost forgot.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.120
- Kaneshita.
- Yes?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.600
How do you feel about getting certified?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780
- What?
- Certified,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.190
to eventually work for the SR squad.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.170
- The SRs?
- Those "Super Rangers"?

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.870
Also known as the Yokohama Special Advanced Rescue Team?

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.480
Yes. Isn't that right, Tanaka-kun?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.860
Indeed.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.080
A certain someone has recommended you.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.630
Me?

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.200
Isn't that amazing?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.320
Right...

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.350
It's only the squad every firefighter dreams of joining.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.800
That's right.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.030
While I'd love for you to stay as a dispatcher,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.040
it's ultimately your choice to make, Kaneshita.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.150
Give it some careful thought, okay?

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.710
I will.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.860
Now then, let us get to work.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.830
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.180
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.320
Excuse me, but I tripped and hit my knee. It hurts so much; I can't walk...

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.830
May I ask which leg?

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.500
My left leg.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550
It hurts so badly, and I can't feel my foot anymore.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.080
I got it. Please tell us where to send the ambulance.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.580
Oh, where am I?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.530
Check a telephone pole if possible.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.040
An address should be written there.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.860
It says 1-22-3 Midorigahama, Aoba Ward.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.770
- "1-22-3 Midorigahama, Aoba Ward"?
- Yes...

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.900
And are you feeling pain anywhere else?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.710
No. Just my knee.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.230
Ouch... this really...
[Dispatch]

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.090
Hang in there, Sir. I've sent an ambulance your way.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.460
Please stay calm; don't agitate your knee any further.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.140
Could I also get your name?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.020
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.820
[119 Emergency Call]

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.980
[CALL 9]

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.570
Do you want to head back out there?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.300
Joining the SR was always your dream.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.560
I'll come to a decision myself.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.550
Th-There's been a landslide! My home has been ruined!

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.510
Noharadai is my wife's hometown.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.140
She's visiting family there now.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.110
It seems another landslide has occurred.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.580
Hikari? Hikari, is that you?

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.910
- The SR?
- Yes.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.750
My responsibilities would drastically change if I transfer.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.100
I'd be working out here again.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.180
They'd even send me overseas, if necessary.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.620
Yes, I had a feeling.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.340
Hikari, what do you think?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.030
Dad says he might join the SR.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.540
Well, Dad was cool as a dispatcher...

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.910
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.930
But the SR is awesome, too.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.040
So which is it?

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.970
It's an SR Blower System!

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.480
Do you want to head back out there?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.840
Pardon?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.440
Joining the SR was always your dream.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.220
Well, I guess.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.680
I see.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.720
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?
- It's an accident!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.210
My car slipped up onto a pedestrian walkway,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.270
and I... I hit a person!

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.120
Understood. Please tell us where to send the ambulance.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.950
Would the name of this intersection work?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.850
- Yes, go ahead.
- It's the intersection right before Koshimiya Station.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.160
Thank you.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.750
And is the individual who has been hit conscious?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.290
Yes, but they're crouching down.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.470
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.090
- A medical emergency.
- What seems to be the issue?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.500
I'm out camping with my friends from university,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.390
and one is shivering like crazy in our tent.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.390
Maybe it's the cold weather...

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.660
Which campground are you at?

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.690
Aoyagi Campground, in Seya Ward.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.920
Do they feel feverish?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.780
No, I don't think so.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.140
I see.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.870
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.470
Hello. I think I've caught some sort of stomach bug.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.120
I've been throwing up and feeling nauseous as well.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.490
Got it. Could you please tell us where you are?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.290
Yes, 2-10-8 Koshibadai, Asahi Ward.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.680
My name is Numata.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.300
So 2-10-8 Koshibadai, Asahi Ward.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.690
- Numata-san, right?
- Yes.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.330
And is that your home, Ma'am?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.390
Yes.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.570
I've sent an ambulance your way. Please tell me more about your symptoms.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.790
Do you feel feverish?

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.430
I'm not too certain. I feel a bit out of it.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.280
Have I caught the norovirus after all?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.440
Very sorry, but we can't give diagnoses ourselves.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.100
Try asking what she ate yesterday or the day before.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.640
Have you eaten anything in the last couple days that could be the cause?

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.140
Well, I did go camping with my friends two days ago.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.460
We enjoyed some grilled oysters together.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.440
Perhaps that was it.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.850
And which campground did you stay at?

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.170
We went to the Aoyagi Campground in Seya Ward.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.310
- "Aoyagi Campground in Seya Ward"?
- Yes.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.860
That's the same campground.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.920
Uesugi-kun, ask what they ate. They might have norovirus as well.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.620
Did you all eat anything at the campground?

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.070
Yes. We were grilling oysters just earlier.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.270
- You all ate oysters?
- Yes.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.920
And how long ago was that?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.350
About 30-40 minutes ago.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.810
That's too fast for norovirus to show symptoms.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.430
Ask about other symptoms.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.070
- Does your friend have other symptoms?
- Please contact the police after our call.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.460
- Okay.
- The ambulance will arrive shortly.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.600
- Stay in the vicinity for their arrival.
- Right.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.650
Ask about her car's condition before you end the call.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.210
Ma'am, what condition is your car in?

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.480
Has it hit anything?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.600
It hit a telephone pole. The front has been squashed.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.590
Is it significantly crushed?

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.340
Do you see any smoke or leaking liquids perhaps?

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.270
Yes, I see something leaking. Maybe oil?

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.710
- So there is a leak?
- Yes.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.700
Ma'am, please step away from your vehicle now.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.210
R-Right.
[Emergency]

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.970
They say their face and lips feel numb?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.710
Yes, face and lips.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.180
Numbness 30 to 40 minutes after eating oysters?

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.440
That paralysis could be due to shellfish poisoning.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.410
"Shellfish poisoning"?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.000
Uesugi-kun, they may be suffering from shellfish poisoning.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.060
Ask if they're breathing.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.370
Is that numbness only in their face? Are they able to breath?

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.340
How are you feeling? Can you breath?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.760
Okay, they say it's getting harder to breath.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.170
Understood. An ambulance is already on its way.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.660
- Please call 119 again if they get worse.
- I will.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.440
Yamashitacho paramedics, this is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.910
I'm sending the Central rescue team to assist. There may have been a gas leak.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.740
- Yes?
- Hey. Do you have time now?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.780
Sure.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.760
We were able to clean up Koshimiya Station without a hassle.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.250
Some quick-witted dispatcher spoke up before a fire erupted.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.800
That was you, wasn't it?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.710
We would've sent you even if I weren't there.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.830
It seems you're really shaping up as a dispatcher.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.460
Have you lost all interest in working out here?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.820
I know SR sent you an offer.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.590
I knew you had a hand in this.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.550
You always wanted to join the SR squad.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.410
Either way, I look forward to working with you again out here.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.860
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.600
Well, I fell with my bike.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.380
Fell? Where are you now, Sir?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.590
Oh, great question. I can see only the sky.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.310
"The sky"?

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.550
How far did you fall? Are you unable to move?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.560
Yes. I can't move an inch.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.680
It's freezing out here, and I have no idea where I am.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.720
Got it. Could I get your name, Sir?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.610
It's Kusaka.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.280
Kusaka-san, right?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.460
Where were you biking before you fell?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.540
I was on the road I always take back home, so that's...

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:33.090
just before District 2 of Kasaicho, in Hodogaya Ward.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.510
- So, you are around District 2 of Kasaicho, Hodogaya Ward.
- Yes.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.100
I've sent an ambulance your way. Are you hurt anywhere?

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.240
Perhaps you hit yourself when you fell?

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.320
Great question. I'm not too sure.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.570
[Irrigation channel]

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:54.320
Kaneshita-san, he may have fallen into an irrigation channel.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.750
Kusaka-san, do you have the capacity to yell?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.520
If so, please try calling for help.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.760
Someone may walk by and notice you.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.230
I'll try. Hello?

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.280
Hello?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.230
- Please, please help me!
- Keep that up, Sir.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.680
Sure.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.990
- Hello? Anyone?
- Squads, this is Yokohama Fire Bureau.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.130
The injured man may have fallen into an irrigation channel.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.420
We believe he is somewhere along the Hodogaya-Asahi Road,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.690
within District 2 of Kasaicho.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.430
- Please focus your search there.
- Second Asahi fire squad. Copy that.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.780
It's so cold out here.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.850
Damn. Why me?

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.280
- Sir, an ambulance will be there soon.
- Sure.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.660
It's currently raining in that area, isn't it?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.120
Kusaka-san. How long has it been since you fell?

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.210
How long? I wonder.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.970
It seems I passed out at some point.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.730
I knew it.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.210
If he was in the rain for long, he may be suffering from hypothermia.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.160
I'm sure it must be freezing, Kusaka-san. Please hold on a bit longer.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.500
I'm absolutely drenched.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.490
Shoot, are my drafts soaked, too?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.800
You may stay on the line with us until the ambulance arrives.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.390
It's cold... Way too cold.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.990
Am I going to die out here?

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.240
- Am I going to die?
- Hang in there. The ambulance has almost arrived.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.390
I haven't even won a single award for my manga yet.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.490
I don't want to die. Please, help me...

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.490
Sir, you'll be okay. Hang in there.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.560
Help is almost there.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.300
- You can stay on the line with us until then.
- Please, help me.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.640
Hang in there.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.420
Kusaka-san, you can do it!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.400
- Hello there.
- Hey.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.030
I'm glad that man with the bike turned out to be okay.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.520
Right.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.380
Thanks.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.470
What?

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.710
For earlier. I appreciated the help.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.780
Excuse me?

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.840
What?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.680
No, it's just...

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.940
This really isn't like you.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.770
You've never thanked me for anything before.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.270
- Say, Kaneshita-san.
- What now?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.230
Don't you want to join the SR?

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.890
You want me to go?

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.080
I just hope we rookies aren't keeping you here

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.510
out of worry for us...

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.050
You're giving yourselves too much credit.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.630
And I'm not worried, not in the slightest.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.630
Then why? I thought you wouldn't hesitate when given the offer.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.970
You want me to leave that badly?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.120
Like I said, that's not my point.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.200
How are you feeling, Sir?

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.150
Right, sorry.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.320
Here.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.070
[What are you doing here?]

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:18.510
You never said not to visit for advice.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.280
Sorry.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.130
I'm... being offered a spot on the SR squad.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.640
But I'm at a loss.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.410
It was always my dream to join SR, and yet...

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:46.160
When I was a firefighter, I once brought great harm to a junior of mine.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.960
- Kaneshita-san?
- Stay back!

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.140
Shiomi! Shiomi!

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.030
Shiomi!

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.520
I ended up disrupting his life.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.980
That incident is the reason I came to the Command department.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.790
My wife is also anxious seeing me consider going back out there.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.850
Of course, I understand her perspective.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:19.310
My wife did seem a bit relieved when I transferred to Command.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.040
Being a dispatcher also gives me a great sense of accomplishment.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:33.040
Dispatchers are always the first to prevent a disaster.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.500
Still, when I hear those voices crying for help,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.440
I feel that urge to be there, and...

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.900
[So you'd go to SR if I gave the word?]

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.730
Sorry, you're right, Sir.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.530
I'll come to a decision myself.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.050
And before I forget...

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.310
Everyone paid their "Legend" fines before I came here.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.940
You've got about 60 coins in there. Ten times per person.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.550
And another for the one I just said.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.660
[1 "Legend" = 100 Yen]

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.600
[Chinese Restaurant]

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.250
Nice restaurant! Maybe I'll invite the guys from Central Station here, too.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.750
Don't. It'd get way too stifling.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.620
Right.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.310
- Is your exam the day after tomorrow, Niijima-san?
- Yes.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.140
The paramedic certification exam?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.930
Good luck.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.650
Sorry I took the day off.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.090
Don't apologize. I'd never say no if it were for a certification.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.140
Thank you.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.510
Niijima-san really is the personification of ambition.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.260
I should learn a thing or two from her.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.290
Maybe I should go get certifications, too.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.050
You have ambitions? That's news to me.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.750
- Uesugi-kun, do you realize how—
- Excuse me, another lemon sour, please.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.570
- I was still talking.
- I'm going to the restroom.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.090
- Okay, we'll continue this conversation there.
- Don't follow me!

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.550
And don't cut off your Senpai when he's talking to you!

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.020
Hey!

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.020
- I'll join you two next Monday.
- Sounds good.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.440
- Grandpa is getting us sushi today.
- Really?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.260
Eat your fill of salted salmon roe.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.040
- Greet your parents for me.
- Sure. See you later.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.310
- Take care. See you soon.
- Bye!

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.320
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.070
I have a major roof leak.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.200
- "A roof leak."
- Yes, it's dripping everywhere.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.050
Can you do something about this?

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.460
I'm sorry, but we don't accept such inquiries.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.130
- I'd suggest contacting a local repair company instead.
- Really?

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.470
This is an emergency line. I will end our call now.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.170
A leak is an emergency.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.540
Sorry for the inconvenience, Sir. Have a good one.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.960
Everyone's calling for leaks.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.590
It's been a rainy week.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.630
Personally, I'm enjoying this peace.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.920
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.080

Are you currently inside your home? Are you safe?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.210
I'm outside. And I'm fine, but my mother was still inside!
[Landslide]

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.130
Your mother is still inside, right?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.090
- Could I get your address, Sir?
- R-Right.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.530
It's 1-309-4 Noharadai, Kanazawa Ward. The name's Murashige.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.510
You said, "1-309-4 Noharadai, Kanazawa Ward," Murashige-san?

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.400
Yes.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.050
Murashige-san, I've sent a rescue squad your way.
[Dispatch]

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.270
Do you know where your mother is within the debris?

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.020
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?
- There's been a landslide.

- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?
- There's been a landslide.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.560
My neighbor's place was swept under.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.910
I see.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.730
Could I get that resident's address? And are you safe, Sir?

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.500
Yes, I'm safe. We're in District 1 of Noharadai in Kanazawa Ward.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.320
My neighbors are the Murashiges.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.130
- "Murashige-san, District 1 Noharadai, Kanazawa Ward"?
- That's right.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.810
Were any other homes or individuals caught

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.050
- in the debris?
- Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.460
Well, I heard the loudest noise outside just now.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.230
- Ma'am, where are you calling from?
- My home.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.140
I think there may have been a landslide in the town over.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.050
Could I get your address please?

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.290
It's 3-106-5 Shiura, Kanazawa Ward.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.750
- My number is...
- We see your number here, Ma'am.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.410
- Team Leader.
- What is it?

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.860
Noharadai is my wife's hometown; she's visiting family there now.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.020
Okay. Go contact them.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.010
Thank you.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.910
I can hear someone's voice from the back door!

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.450
- From the back door, you say?
- Yes!

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.090
Mom!

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.840
Murashige-san, I need you to stand back and remain safe

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.970
- until the rescue squad arrives.
- B-But...

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.040
Get our cameras to show the Noharadai area.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.340
All right.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.390
I see it.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.220
Do landslides usually occur without any warning?

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.460
This week of rain must have loosened the soil.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.220
This is Takachiho from Squad 3 speaking.
[Internal Call]

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.830
There's been a landslide in the Kanazawa Ward.

We'll have calls coming in. Be on stand-by.

Yes. I think District 3 will be fine.

But Mom and Dad went out to get us sushi.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.750
Just stay alert, okay? Evacuate as soon as you sense something wrong.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.220
We will. Did you want to talk to Hikari?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.820
Sure.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.720
Hikari, it's Dad.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.140
- Dad?
- Hikari,

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.250
keep your mother safe until Grandma and Grandpa return, okay?

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.600
I will.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.420
Good.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.360
Hey, it's me again.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.180
He's currently helping someone else.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.630
Can't they have someone else take his call?

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.770
- Mikami-san.
- Dear, don't.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.420
You're asking the impossible.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.890
Why is he busy now, of all times?

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.710
I'm sorry about my husband.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.620
The rescue squad has advised us not to get close to our home,

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.770
but we've lost contact with our daughter.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.280
Sir, please stand back; it's dangerous!

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.520
Mikami-san, can you hear me? If you can, please respond.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.750
If you only cry, you can't save your husband.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.690
Yes. Yes, I understand. Just please hurry!

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.410
An ambulance is already on its way.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.450
However, we must administer CPR until then.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.740
Mikami-san, you will be the one to do it. Am I clear?

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.790
Yes. What do I do?

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.280
First, lay your husband down, face-up.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.500
Please evacuate somewhere safe with your husband, Ma'am.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.800
We will. Thank you for answering when you must be busy.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.640
It's no worry at all. I will now end our call here.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.650
Is your husband lying face-up?

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.090
One moment...

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.500
Dear, were you always this skinny?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.000
He actually came home before the last train for once today.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.660
- He's lying down.
- I'll guide you through the rest.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.870
Next, kneel down next to your husband.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.180
- Okay.
- Now extend your arms,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.050
and you'll press down about 5 centimeters into your husband's chest.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:43.350
- Okay.
- Our rhythm with be one, two, three, four. Ready?

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.580
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.720
One, two, three, four.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.130
One, two, three...

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:58.790
Dispatchers are always the first to prevent a disaster.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.600
- One, two, three, four...
- Mikami-san, keep it up. You can do it!

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.900
- One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
- Dear... Dear!

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:14.390
- One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
- Dear, please... Please!

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.070
Keep it up. An ambulance is on its way.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.150
One, two, three, four.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.480
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.840
One, two, three, four.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.820
You can do this, Mikami-san. Please proceed.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.410
One, two, three...

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.650
Is that the ambulance?

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.150
Yes!

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.820
Yokohama Fire Bureau! Mikami-san?

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.560
The paramedics have arrived.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.080
Please have them give you further instructions.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.790
I will end our call here.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.760
Okay.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.090
Please, help him.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:02.810
Kaneshita-san, there was a call from your wife's parents.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.800
They were incredibly worried about her.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.370
Kaneshita.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.230
Hello?

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.200
This is Mutsuo. I'm sorry I couldn't answer earlier.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.400
Have you managed to contact Shiori at all?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.000
I did, but only earlier today.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.600
Sorry.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600
Don't apologize.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.250
My daughter chose to marry a firefighter.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.820
So, please.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.480
Please save Shiori and Hikari.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.320
Please, I'm begging you.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.700
I will.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.850
We have successfully rescued the individual trapped

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.370
in her home in District 1 of Noharadai.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.900
Central Rescue Squad will now head to District 3

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.050
to assist SR, if you would give the order.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.330
Yokohama Fire Bureau. Copy that.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.360
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.940
[070-554-756]

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.940
Hikari?

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.190
Hikari, is that you?

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.120
Hikari, it's me, Dad.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.500
- Dad...
- Hikari, are you okay?

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.740
Are you hurt? I'll save you right away.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.260
Yes.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.250
I'm okay.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.100
But Mom...

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.300
Mom? Is she hurt?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.300
Her leg is stuck.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.900
Hikari?

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.770
Hello? Hikari?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.600
It's so dark. I can't see anything.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.000
Hikari, you don't need to move, okay? Just—

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Hikari?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.380

Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.000
You've heard of the landslide, yes?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.870
See, I live right next to the Ishikuras.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:06.860
- Got it.
- Yes, and their daughter and grandson are visiting.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.490
But a landslide hit their place earlier!

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.760
The landslide in District 3 of Noharadai, correct?

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.220
A rescue squad is on their way to provide assistance.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.480
Hatakeyama-san, hurry! Over here!

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.980
Yes, I'm coming.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.900
The Ishikura house is the last we have to check.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.900
I'll head on over and see if anyone is inside.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.130
Ma'am, it's dangerous. Please stand back someplace safe.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.700
What are you saying?

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.470
I've known both Shiori-chan and Hikari-chan since they were wee babies.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.900
I have to check on them. One moment.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.130
Hello?

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.560
Shiori-chan! Hikari-chan! Where are you?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.340
I've come to help! Say something!

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.290
Shiori-chan? Shiori-chan!

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.600
There you are!

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.400
Where's Hikari-chan? He's with you?

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.320
They're both inside.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.740
It seems they're stuck in there.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.860
But I could hear their voices, loud and clear!

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.750
Ma'am, thank you.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.830
But it's dangerous, so please stand back.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.700
There, I see the rescue squad!

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.800
Are those... the Super Rangers?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.800

This is the Yokohama Fire Bureau. Copy that.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.860
It seems the rescue squad has arrived.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.870
Please leave the rest to them.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.810
No, but you see,

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:57.400
there's some rubble blocking the road.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.750
We neighborhood folk will help clear a path!

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.690
- Ma'am...
- Over here!

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.010
You hold that side.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.330
What are you doing, Hatakeyama-san? Hold that side for me!

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.590
- Right, yes.
- Ready?

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.600
And heave!

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.100
Put your back into it, Hatakeyama-san!

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.650
- Sorry...
- Again!

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.900
Heave! Yes, they can make it through.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.800
- Ma'am, please stand aside. It's dangerous.
- Yes, yes.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.270
They're inside. Please save them!

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.700
Thank you. Leave the rest to us, Ma'am.

Yes, I know, I know.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.330
Beware of any secondary disasters. Commence rescue!

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.840
Yes, Sir!

One, two, three!

Entering building!

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.160
Can you see the individuals inside?

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.850
Not yet, Sir!

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.220
Three meters left.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.950

Two meters left!

Go ahead, Captain.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.300
Both individuals have been rescued from the crumbled home.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.710

We have confirmed their rescue as well.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.220
Thank you for your assistance, Ma'am.

Watch for crush syndrome.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.600
- Yes, Sir.
- One, two, three.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.200
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Sir.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.720
You're all right now, Ma'am. Great job holding out in there.

Have a good one.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.500
- See you all tomorrow.
- See you.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.980
Dad!

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.700
I'm sorry.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.900
I'm so sorry I was late.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.500
Don't be. We believed you would save us.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.500
Isn't that right, Hikari?

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.660
Hey.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.700
I wanted to pick up where we left off about your job.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.500
We don't need to talk about that now.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.200
If you want to head back out there, you can.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.770
No matter what you decide,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.200
we'll both support your choice.

- Good morning.
- Morning.

How was the exam?

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.400
- I probably could have done better.
- I see.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.690
What are you reading?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.900
Oh, well, this...

A Chinese textbook?
[Learning Chinese]

Why?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.020
I thought it'd be handy

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.530
to have another team member who could speak a foreign language.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.270
So you went for Chinese.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.220
Why? Got any issues with that?

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.860
On to our next headline.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.170
Two days have passed since the double landslides

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.020
occurred in Noharadai, Kanazawa Ward.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.940
Removal of the debris is still underway.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.080
Experts suggest the continuous days of rain

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:25.510
may have caused the soil to loosen, leading to these landslides.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:30.280
Three were injured, two seriously.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.140
However, thanks to our expert rescue squads,

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.190
there were no casualties to be seen.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:52.620
A... I... U... E... O...*

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.400
Shiomi?

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.500
Shiomi!

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.890
Shiomi? Shiomi!

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.400
Happy birthday, Kaneshita-san!

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.830
Fire department's 119. Is it a fire or medical emergency?

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.900
Hello?

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.980
You've reached 119.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.640

[Preview]

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.640
There's a fire. Some cardboard is burning.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.360
Would extinguishing the flames be impossible?

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.180
Apparent arson has plagued vacant buildings since last month.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.380
Shiomi Sota.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.100
Two years ago, I made a mistake that cost him his firefighting career.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.310
I wonder if he truly holds a grudge against the Bureau.
[This drama is fiction.]

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.050
I want to prevent whatever fires I can by doing all I can.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.810
I guess Detective Minowa-san's theory was incorrect.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.820
Kaneshita-san, where are you right now?

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.700
I saw someone suspicious near the fire's location.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.100
Kaneshita, stop.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.640
Are you the one behind these fires?

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.840
Kaneshita-san?

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.300
Kaneshita-san, are you all right?

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.200
Kaneshita-san?
